‘Latinx,’ ‘hangry’ and 840 more words added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary
BY MICHAEL SCHAUB

Merriam-Webster has added more than 840 words to its dictionary. If you’re impatient and “hangry,” here’s the “TL;DR”: some of your “faves” might have made the list.
Despite the controversy around the gender-neutral Latinx (the case for and against), Merriam-Webster has added “Latinx,” which it officially defines as “of, relating to, or marked by Latin American heritage —used as a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.”
The list is heavy on food-related words like “hangry,” which Merriam-Webster defines as “irritable or angry because of hunger.” Other culinary terms added to the dictionary include “mise en place” (“a culinary process in which ingredients are prepared and organized... before cooking”), “zoodle” (“a long, thin strip of zucchini that resembles a string or narrow ribbon of pasta”) and “guac” (you have to pay extra for this definition).
If you prefer a liquid lunch, you might enjoy new entries such as “hophead” (“a beer enthusiast”), who knows what to do with a “flight” (“a selection of alcoholic drinks ... for tasting as a group”), but you might be better off with a “mocktail” (“a nonalcoholic cocktail”).
As is usually the case when Merriam-Webster adds new words, entries inspired by technology and computers are well represented. The dictionary has added a definition for “airplane mode,” which it defines as “an operating mode for an electronic device ... in which the device does not connect to wireless networks and cannot send or receive communications ... or access the Internet but remains usable for other functions.”
Word nerds who can’t stand it when nouns get verbed are unlikely to be pleased with “Instagramming,” defined as “post[ing] (a picture) to the Instagram photo-sharing service.”
Many of the new words are popular with young people, both millennials and members of “Generation Z” (“the generation of people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s”). These include “fave” (“favorite”), “rando” (“a person who is not known or recognizable or whose appearance ... seems unprompted or unwelcome”) and “time suck” (“an activity to which one devotes a lot of time that might be better or more productively spent doing other things”).
If you’ve made it this far, you probably don’t need the “TL;DR” version — that is, “too long; didn’t read — used to say that something would require too much time to read."

‘Latinos’ is out, ‘Latinx’ is in at UC San Diego in nod to evolving gender and sexuality terms
BY GARY ROBBINS

UC San Diego has begun using new words to refer to Latinos and Chicanos in a move that reflects the profound change that’s occurring nationally in the way many people define their gender and sexuality.
The gender-specific terms Latino and Chicano are being selectively replaced with Latinx and Chicanx to promote acceptance of virtually anyone who falls under the headings.
The change is being promoted by students, social justice activists and the LGBTQ community, which are trying to get people to look beyond conventional notions of gender, sex and appearance.
As broadly used, Latino refers to people of Latin American origin or descent.
Latinx includes men and women of Latin American descent, people who are not exclusively male or female, people who don’t think of themselves as a man or a woman, and people who don’t act or dress in ways that are common to people of their gender.
The same basic definition applies to Chicanx, with the exception of heritage. Chicanos are Americans of Mexican descent.
“This is about making the university more inclusive,” said Becky Pettit, UC San Diego’s vice chancellor of equity, diversity and inclusion. “We’re meeting students where they are.”
The university also is trying to more broadly appeal to Latinos, an area where it has lagged behind some University of California campuses.
The new word changes, made this week, mean that the school will use Latinx and Chicanx in a lot of its official communications, such as news releases and publicity. The words also might end up being used in the naming of certain campus events.
Schools like Grossmont and MiraCosta colleges already use those terms in their publicity. So does UC Irvine. The University of San Diego holds a Chicanx/Latinx graduation.
But deeper change is being sought. And it involves two words — Latinx and Chicanx — that are not widely used by the general public, partly because there’s confusion about what the words mean and how they are pronounced.
People are especially perplexed by Latinx, which was reflected in a reader survey published this year by Remezcla, a media company.
The survey found that readers were almost evenly divided between pronouncing Latinx as latin-x and la-teen-x. A small percentage preferred lah-tinks. Still others have suggested referring to Latinos as Latin@, a gender-neutral term that hasn’t caught on.
Colleges and universities are often among the first places for new language to appear. That’s precisely what’s been happening over the last couple of years.
At UC San Diego, it is no longer uncommon for a person to announce their “personal pronouns” when they introduce themselves at a meeting.
For example, a person might say, “My pronouns are he/him/his” or “she/her/hers.” Or the person could ask to simply be referred to as “they” because their gender identity doesn’t neatly match that of a man or a woman.
The issue of gender identity also has surfaced in the way students apply for undergraduate admission to the University of California system.
Students can now choose from heterosexual/straight, bisexual, gay and lesbian to describe their sexuality.
Under gender, they can select gender nonconforming, genderqueer, transgender, trans man, trans male, trans woman or trans female.
Making a selection — which is voluntary — can be confusing. Some of the terms aren’t well known to the general public, and some have multiple meanings.
The UC says that genderqueer refers to “a person whose gender identity and/or gender expression falls outside of the dominant social norm of the assigned sex, is beyond genders, or is some combination.”
The new California Gender Recognition Act is likely to make all of these terms more familiar to a wider audience. The act, which begins to take effect Jan. 1, will make it easier for people who are transgender, nonbinary or intersex to obtain state-issued IDs that specify their gender.
“Terms and practices change over time,” said Dayo F. Gore, an ethnic studies professor at UC San Diego. “It doesn’t mean it is a zero-sum game. The important thing is how do we think about the changes. It gives us a chance to be open and speak.”
The San Diego Union-Tribune asked Pettit whether some people will view words such as Latinx as an act of political correctness, leading to blowback against the campus.
“I think the nature of higher education as institutions is to create spaces for resistance and for people to redefine themselves and for people to redefine the world that they want to live in,” Pettit said.
“I don’t mean to sound flippant, but that’s what universities exist for: to allow people to think freely, to allow people to redefine and shift culture.”"

How I Made It: She peddled pencils as a child. Now she owns a company that celebrates Latinx culture
BY MELISSA GOMEZ

Patty Delgado, 27, is founder of Hija de tu Madre, a Los Angeles company that started when she sewed a patch bearing the revered image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, plus sequins, onto a denim jacket. She started the company in 2016 exploring what it means to be Latinx, a gender-neutral term to describe the Latina and Latino community. She’s now trying to establish it as a lifestyle brand as she expands the products she offers.
‘Career-obsessed’
As a child, Delgado said, she was “career-obsessed.” In fifth grade, she would sell pencils and Tic Tac mints to classmates, a story that her father likes to remind her of, she said. “It’s really embarrassing to admit that now, but you gotta do what you gotta do,” she said with a laugh. When she was younger, she considered becoming a lawyer or journalist.
Family businesses
Delgado’s parents did not stifle her dreams, she said, and instead taught her how to be her own boss. Her father’s sisters own their own businesses, and her parents, who are from Jalisco, Mexico, are also business owners who have tried their hand at different ideas, she said.
“I’ve gotten to see my parents fail at a lot of their businesses but also succeed,” she said. Her parents own a business delivering tortillas to grocery stores in the L.A. area.
Finding a path
Delgado attended UCLA with the intention of majoring in English but later switched to religious studies and worked at a school magazine, where she built on her graphic design skills.
But the field was mostly limited to academia and working at a church, she said, and when she graduated with a bachelor’s degree, she had nothing lined up.
“I didn’t really know what my ultimate career goal was,” she said. She applied for graphic design internships and began building a portfolio, which led to freelancing opportunities.
The lightbulb moment
In 2016, while traveling, she found a colorful sequined patch of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a familiar image in Latino households, and one that reminded her of her grandmother. When she returned to L.A., she sewed it onto a denim jacket and “a lightbulb went off.”
She felt it was something her friends who shared a similar upbringing — one filled with wafting smells of beans in the house and parents with accented English — would connect with.
A ‘scrappy’ team
With no savings, she used $500 from a recent freelancing gig to buy 30 denim jackets, a one-month subscription for a website and supplies.
She called her company Hija de tu Madre, the name of her travel blog. The phrase can be used endearingly when someone, typically a child, is acting up, “or you say it when you’re like, ‘Damn girl, you did that,’ ” she said.
She describes her company’s debut as perfect — in November 2016, her jacket was featured in blogs and online publications for the holiday season. The orders came rolling in, and from her parents’ couch in Boyle Heights, she hand-sewed more than 100 patches onto denim jackets over the course of two months.
Her father dropped the packages off at the post office, her brothers posted the labels, and her boyfriend and mother helped sew on the patches, she said. “We were really scrappy,” Delgado said.
Making the leap
Five months after launching Hija de tu Madre, she stopped taking on graphic design clients to focus on her business, which she expanded to include jackets adorned with Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and accessories such as jewelry and phone cases.
“The sales were coming in, the bills were being paid,” she said. “So I knew that this was something that consumers wanted. I just knew the timing was right for a business like mine.”
Creating a lifestyle
Delgado doesn’t want to just sell outerwear — she wants to create a lifestyle brand.
“Being Latina is a lifestyle, and I think it’s one that you can’t get anywhere else” other than Hija de tu Madre, she said.
Delgado said she felt larger clothing companies weren’t representing the Latinx community, so she set out to explore what it meant to be Latinx and the cultures within the community. She also made products that were inclusive, and her models (mainly friends) represented a variety of ages, races and sizes.
She sells necklaces and jackets bearing the names of other Central and South American countries, as well as “Latinx” necklaces.
Becoming a jefa
Despite her company’s growth (she now has two paid part-time employees and has sold more than 500 jackets), Delgado said she initially struggled with taking herself and her company seriously.
In the early days of Hija de tu Madre, she had people brush it aside as just a side craft project. But once she began to take herself seriously, her mentality changed. She found other Latina entrepreneurs in the area, and she leans on them for support.
Delgado considers it one of the many mistakes she has made. Her advice to others who want to become jefas, or women bosses, is to take their work seriously.
“Don’t let anyone diminish how important your work or your creativity is, because at the end of the day, this is an extension of you,” she said.
Expanding into 2019
In 2018, Hija de tu Madre made a six-figure gross profit, Delgado said.
Customers asked for more office products, and she complied, offering pens that say “dale,” or “go for it,” and a nameplate that reads: La Jefa. The Boss.
In December, Delgado launched a 2019 planner, Échale ganas, which translates to “work hard,” that she spent months perfecting, choosing the right fonts, images and affirmations.
The planners, priced at $49.99, sold out in 45 minutes, she said. The second batch also sold out.
This year, Delgado said she hopes to expand her product line to include footwear and swimwear. In February, she launched beauty products, which so far include a mirror and wide-tooth comb.
Delgado, who recently returned from a trip to Thailand, said that although she enjoys spending time with family and friends, she is usually itching to get back to work.
“This is my life now, and I think that that’s how you really know that you love something,” she said."

Club Scum celebrates three years of championing the LGBTQ Latinx community
BY STEPHANIE MENDEZ

Even for the often anything-goes, underground Los Angeles punk scene, this night felt unexpected.
Mariachi trio La Victoria had just played traditional Mexican classics by Juan Gabriel, Vicente Fernández and Selena, and drag queens followed with lip-sync performances before longstanding queer punk act Limp Wrist took the stage.
Wigs flew as the drag queens crowd-surfed over the audience, who safely carried them above the circle pit, all while singing in unity: “I love hardcore boys, I love boys hardcore!”
Club Scum on this night last March was celebrating its second anniversary, an evening that once again merged incongruous worlds with cohesive ease. Since its inception in 2016, founders and East L.A. natives Rudy Bleu, 40, and Ray “Hex-Ray” Sanchez, 30, have made it their mission to provide a safe space for punks in the LGBTQ Latinx community.
Club Scum turns 3 this year and began the celebration with a drag pageant Friday at Club Chico, where two performers moved on to battle for the crown Sunday at the Regent in a full-blown party.
The sold-out night will boast a rare appearance from Hunx and His Punx with support from an eclectic mix that includes electronic artist DJ Irene, Mexican rock act Cremalleras and local punks Trap Girl, among others.
Yet the Club Scum experience is beholden to no one sound or genre.
“I’ve always been into house music so being able to have DJ Irene — the lineup is very obscure and sometimes doesn’t make sense, but it has all elements of music and experiences,” Sanchez said.
“As much as Scum is punk, it’s also very heavily Latinx,” Bleu added. “I just think it’s punk in ways that’s not traditional, and we push boundaries as far as performance and the music we play and the DJs we book.”
Bleu and Sanchez have been hosting their inclusive party on the last Friday of every month at Club Chico in Montebello. Both Bleu and Sanchez were already active in the punk community by DJ-ing events, creating DIY zines and organizing shows when they decided to create an event that encompassed their backgrounds and inspirations.
“For us, it was really important that it happen in the Eastside, East L.A. Montebello area, because that’s where we grew up, and the whole point in doing it was that we wanted this party for people in the neighborhood,” Bleu said.
“I was just tired of being in queer punk spaces that were so white,” Bleu continued. “I’d done queer dance parties that were more on the fringes of punk, but they were just so white, and there’s this huge community here that we felt needed representation and the space to gather and create and dance.”
Daniel Lopez Jr., 28, performs as Lady Forbidden and first began to do drag at the age of 16 under the guidance of the late Martin Medrano, otherwise known as Ms. Martin, with the latter’s family, Flawless Victory. (In drag culture, a family is a safe community where queens foster one another under the tutelage of a “mother” figure to compete against other families.)
Lopez frequently collaborates with Bleu and Sanchez at Club Scum by hosting, performing and scouting new talent as well as helping with logistics. Lopez became involved when his partner, 28-year-old Andrew Sanjose, was booked to perform drag under the stage name Fasique. Sanjose invited Lopez, and when they arrived, Bleu asked Lopez to host Club Scum.
“It was honestly one of the best things that’s happened to me,” Lopez said.
Lopez is a longtime veteran of the L.A. drag community, and when not helping with Club Scum, Lopez performs with the DoomHaus drag family.
As a seasoned queen, Lopez said Club Scum differs from the West Hollywood LGBTQ scene by specifically focusing on intersectionality and celebrating people of color.
“The thing that stands out is there is more than four or five brown people in the room … I love going to a dance party and seeing people that look like me, seeing people that make me feel comfortable and accept me for who I am. That is part of the whole Scum experience,” Lopez said.
Moreover, Club Scum aims to include drag styles, performers and identities that don’t fit into stereotypes.
“The performances are really diverse, we do have a lot of the crazier queens who do more extreme numbers, like doing punk songs or industrial stuff, but then we also have traditional queens who will turn out a traditional drag performance,” Bleu said.
“These are queens that are usually rejected in West Hollywood or are not really given any [opportunity] because their drag just doesn’t fit the aesthetic there,” Sanchez said. “People will be like ‘Oh my God gross, she’s spitting blood’ — fake blood. I feel like the performances that we book is like literally watching a punk band. You get that same satisfaction, that same energy.”
Club Scum’s celebration of the anomalous — within a community that is already marginalized — has greatly contributed to its success. The work has resonated beyond the L.A. area and evolved into remote events in New York, Mexico City and San Francisco. A prior pop-up in S.F. was so popular Club Scum was invited to come back and establish a quarterly residency this year.
“The Bay has been really receptive to it, and the first time we did Scum we were both really nervous up there because we were not sure what it was gonna look like, and then it was crazy,” Bleu said. “I remember being almost moved to tears because I just looked at the crowd and I felt like we were at Chico, and it was like, all these cool brown queer kids singing along to songs, and dancing all crazy, and everyone’s sweaty, it just felt like home.”
Ultimately, creating a home and family for misfits is the core value for Club Scum.
“It’s a safe space, it’s a good space, it’s like a family party,” Lopez said. “It’s more intimate. Yeah, we do get new people, but you know everybody, and even if you don’t know them you’re a family. It’s a very touching place.”"

dictionary.com adds new words, including ‘cybermob,’ ‘Latinx’ and ‘dad joke’
BY MICHAEL SCHAUB

JSYK, dictionary.com added more than 300 new words and definitions to its website Wednesday, highlighting the influences of the internet and increased attention to social justice issues on the English language.
The new entries include abbreviations and acronyms like “JSYK,” a common internet expression that stands for “just so you know.” Also added was “JOMO,” defined as “joy of missing out: a feeling of contentment with one’s own pursuits and activities, without worrying over the possibility of missing out on what others may be doing.""(That term is a take-off of “FOMO,” or “fear of missing out.”)
Other terms originating on the internet include “crybully,” which the website defines as “a person who self-righteously harasses or intimidates others while playing the victim, especially of a perceived social injustice.” The goal of crybullies is often to incite a “cybermob,” or "" a self-perpetuating group of people carrying out a campaign of online harassment that often includes ridicule and shaming or hate speech and threats, in response to reported news, stated opinions, published images, etc.”
Questioning the motives of other internet users has become a favorite hobby of social media users, which has given us words like “tone policing” (“a conversational tactic that dismisses the ideas being communicated when they are perceived to be delivered in an angry,frustrated, sad, fearful, or otherwise emotionally charged manner”) and “virtue signaling” (“the sharing of one’s point of view on a social or political issue ... in order to garner praise or acknowledgment of one’s righteousness from others who share that point of view, or to passively rebuke those who do not”).
If you’re wary of wading into social media fights (and we do not blame you), you can always limit your posts to simple interjections like “welp” (“an informal variant of ‘well’ used to indicate disappointment, resignation, or acceptance”) or “womp womp” (“an expression used to dismiss or to mock a failure, loss, etc.”).
Many of the words added to the dictionary come from discussions of culture, identity and social justice. Among these are “Latinx,” a gender-neutral term defined as “of or relating to people of Latin American descent,” and “colorism,” which refers to “differential treatment based on skin color, especially favoritism toward those with a lighter skin tone and mistreatment or exclusion of those with a darker skin tone, typically among those of the same racial group or ethnicity.”
Conversations about race have brought about terms like “white fragility” (“the tendency among members of the dominant white cultural group to have a defensive, wounded, angry, or dismissive response to evidence of racism”) and “white lash” (“a hostile or violent reaction by white people to the advances or influx of other racial or ethnic groups”).
Not all the new words are so serious in nature. New terms on the lighter side include “bromosexual,” an adjective “noting or relating to a close but nonsexual friendship between two men, typically a heterosexual man and a gay man.” This kind of friendship could take the form of a “textlationship,” or “a relationship or association between people who text each other frequently, but rarely if ever interact with each other in person.”
And if you’re an older person trying to annoy a member of “Generation Z” (“the generation born after the mid-1990s”), you could always try telling a tried-and-true “dad joke” (“a corny and generally unfunny joke reminiscent of the types of remarks made by middle-aged or elderly fathers to their children”)."

From Vaporú to coming out, NHMC amplifies an array of Latinx voices
BY CARLOS DE LOERA

One minute a child is enjoying a nice helping of frozen yogurt. When he’s suddenly stricken with brain-freeze, the people he is eating with react with fear and try to ease his pain.
Next thing he knows he’s covered in a thick layer of Vicks VapoRub while someone’s abuelita (but definitely not his own grandma) has lighted an unsettling number of candles and has summoned the divine to heal him.
As outlandish as it sounds, this is an experience very familiar to many in the Latinx community. And it perfectly set the mood at this year’s National Hispanic Media Coalition’s Latino Scene Showcase at El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood.
‘Vivaporu’: For many Latinos, memories of Vicks VapoRub are as strong as the scent of eucalyptus »
The showcase, now in its seventh year, highlights Latinx writers, actors and directors by giving them a platform to perform in front of industry executives, agents, talent managers and casting directors.
At Wednesday’s event, representatives from Netflix, Amazon Studios, CBS, ABC, HBO, Starz, the Writers Guild of America West and Univision attended.
“Latinos make up 24% of movie-goers and yet statistics show that we are only a little over 3% of the roles” said Brenda Castillo, incoming president and chief executive of NHMC. “We’re all about building a pipeline between Latinx talent and the industry.”
The NHMC was founded 33 years ago to address the lack of Latinx representation in film and television and to create opportunities both in front of and behind the camera.
“We do this because how [Latinx people] are perceived is how we are treated, and we are not treated well across the country right now,” said current NHMC President and Chief Executive Alex Nogales. “If we’re absent from mainstream media, we are always going to be looked down on. And if we’re stereotyped, it’s just as bad.”
Since NHMC launched, its relationship with the entertainment industry has evolved. The organization used to reach out to executives to stay on their radar, but the tables have turned. Now the industry is eager to work with the NHMC because it realizes that Latinx people are more needed and marketable than ever before.

Castillo has noticed this shift and said it’s more important that the multitude of Latinx stories be told accurately. “For it to be authentic, it should be Latinos telling our own stories,” she said.
This year’s showcase featured six short scenes, which involved the magical healing powers of abuelas (grandmothers), a demon Realtor helping Adam and Eve apartment hunt in Sodom and a woman struggling with her identity after motherhood.
As a space for encouraging increased representation, the showcase also told the stories of marginalized groups within the Latinx community, including women and the LGBTQ community. Of the six scenes performed, women wrote two and directed four of them.
Actress Elena Campbell-Martínez, who stars as Doña Lupe on the Starz series “Vida,” directed two of the night’s scenes. She said she was drawn to the showcase because it put a spotlight on the experience of growing up in a Latinx household.
In Starz’s new ‘Vida,’ the politics of gender and gentrification on L.A.’s Eastside get personal »
Nikki Taguluas-Pierce, who wrote the brain-freeze scene, said she was interested in exploring some of the stranger experiences she had growing up Latina. (Taguluas-Pierce had aunts who would tell her she could alleviate suffering by lighting a candle and burying the wax.)
A scene titled “Guero,” written by Joe Gonzalez, focused on a young man who is coming out as a Republican to his parents, who didn’t take the news well. . After being berated for several minutes, the son finally told his parents that he’s actually not a Republican — but instead revealed that he is gay.
Nathanel Martinez, who played the son in that scene, was drawn to the character because, as someone who identifies as queer, he understood the fear and liberation of coming out. He knows from having religious Hispanic parents how they might react to that type of news. Martinez also liked the idea of the scene having “real representation.”
“There are straight actors who play gay roles, but for being Latino and actually queer, it’s really important to actually showcase that,” he said.
Becoming part of the showcase is no small task. Actors must go through the full wringer of the casting process, competing against hundreds of other worthy actors and awaiting the prospect of a callback. This year’s group of actors ended up auditioning for casting directors from NBC, ABC and the Casting Society of America.
The hard work can pay off, though: Two former participants in the program are now working for Netflix and one is at Disney.
Castillo is excited that, even though there is still much work to be done, the need and want for Latinx stars is finally catching up with the community’s talent."

Op-Ed: My Latinx students write what they know. And their words are powerful
BY MARCOS M. VILLATORO

The first college class I taught was Introduction to Creative Writing. I asked the students to write a personal essay on an incident that had a profound effect on them. Many wrote about family life, a beloved grandmother who died, a bully in middle school and other subjects you’d expect from young college students. But Veronica’s essay was different. It began with, “I was two, and sitting on my father’s shoulders when the National Guard shot into the crowd.”
She wrote about the day of Archbishop Oscar Romero’s funeral in El_Salvador in 1980, when she was 2 years old. A right-wing death squad had murdered the priest, who often spoke out against the state-sanctioned violence against the Salvadoran people. Romero had become a leader and an advocate for the poor and oppressed of his country. This got him killed.
Veronica wrote about the ocean of people who had attended his funeral. They couldn’t all fit in the cathedral. She and her father stood in the plaza outside, alongside over 100,000 other mourners. Her father had just lifted her to his shoulders when the first bombs went off. Army sharpshooters on roofs shot into the crowd. Veronica fell from her father’s shoulders. From her toddler’s perspective, the legs of the people surrounding her resembled a moving forest. She remembered the roar of screams. Her father snatched her up and pushed his way into the cathedral, where others brought in the bodies of the dozens of Salvadorans who had been killed or wounded.
This was one of the first essays I graded as a new professor at what is now Mount St. Mary’s University in Los Angeles, which stands on a mountain above Brentwood and overlooks all of the city and the Pacific Ocean. With its Spanish architecture and manicured grounds that look like the floor of heaven had fallen onto the Earth, it might appear to be a college for the elite, where only the wealthy attend.
Far from it. Many of my students are from Mexico, Central America, Compton and East L.A. Part of the university’s mission is to open its doors to those who have little access to higher education — the poor and working class. Ours is a largely brown student body. As college students in the U.S., the Latinx students in my creative writing classes have unique and rare stories to tell.
Veronica wrote that essay in 1998, when she was 21. She didn’t write much about the politics of the time — the fact that the U.S. government was sending almost $2 million dollars a day to the Salvadoran military, the same military that sent death squads to kill civilians they deemed to be communists. Hers was a first-person account of a massacre, witnessed by a child.
Before sitting down to grade a batch of essays, I always brace myself. Grading papers is usually the most dreadful part of a professor’s job, but my students’ essays are often loaded with stories of injustice. Many are as powerful, and disturbing, as Veronica’s.
More recently, border-crossing essays are front and center. “I crossed the border when I was four. My mother and I crouched inside a hidden compartment in the floor of the bus.” “My parents came because of the gangs and death threats in El_Salvador.” “I want to go to the protests for immigrant rights, but I’m DACA. They might catch me and take me away.” “ICE hit our apartments and took my neighbors, I felt helpless because I couldn’t do anything.”
These stories have proliferated since 2016, when it became clear that, under the new U.S. president, their lives as Latinx people were about to get harder. They write about the pain of racial slurs and accusations — about how they are called rapists, murderers and marauders who threaten U.S. national security. There is fear in their words but also anger, a recognition of the injustices of our times. They have a solid grasp of the political winds blowing against them, and most essays end with a barbaric yawp, a sense of “I’ll be damned if I let that guy in the White House bring me down.” Some write about becoming lawyers so they can fight for immigration rights. Others plan to run for office. Many simply commit themselves to the fight, through protests and voting.
Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »
Their writings also delve into dark territory. “Why do they hate us so much?” “Why are more people turning against us?” “Will this ever end?” These are brave essays, for it takes courage to explore the hate that rises from racism.
When I read their words it feels as though I’m holding their very lives in my hands. Long ago I realized I couldn’t merely give them notes on their grammar or quickly comment about the theme. Their papers are returned with my own mini-essays on them, a reflection on what they’ve dared to write. These students, at such young ages, have endured more tragedies than many of us will experience in our lifetimes: poverty, homelessness, deportation, persecution. They deserve more than a “good job” or “interesting story.” They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be read.
It can be emotionally exhausting to grade these essays, but it is also a great privilege. Writing about pain is in itself a bold act. My students suffer; they sometimes are afraid. And they are some of the most courageous people I know. I can see them as activists, leaders, lawyers and walking the halls of Congress. It’s easy to imagine, given the strength of their words."

Latinx is the focus of reinvigorated Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival
BY CARLOS AGUILAR

Immigration stories have been a defining part of the on-screen narrative Hollywood has assigned to Latinos in the United States, one that when told by those without sufficient knowledge or interest in the community’s ample range of experiences does it a disservice in that it generalizes and furthers stereotypical portrayals.
Subverting the victimization and impotence so often prevalent in border-crossing or ICE-fearing tales is “The Infiltrators,” which intersperses raw footage with scripted sequences from U.S. Latinx filmmakers Alex Rivera (“Sleep Dealer”) and Cristina Ibarra (“Las Marthas”), The bold docufiction hybrid follows a group of Dreamers, part of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance (NIYA), as they organize an elaborate plan to prevent the deportation of detainees at the for-profit Broward Transitional Center in Florida.
Unsurprisingly, this rebellious ode to resistance that bridges the gap between Latin American immigrants — those brought here as children and the adults that came in search of a livable future — and their U.S.-born allies was selected as the opening-night presentation of the 2019 Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival (LALIFF), and will enjoy its local premiere at Hollywood’s Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. “The Infiltrators” is being adapted as a scripted series by Blumhouse Television.
Given the U.S. government’s dehumanizing stance on immigration, specifically in regard to undocumented individuals and asylum seekers at the southern border, the way immigrants are represented in media has taken on even greater significance. Stories are undeniably powerful, and when wielded negatively their impact results in misinformation and hatred.
An empowering testament to the power of strategic organizing, Rivera and Ibarra’s latest film flips the script and introduces its protagonists not merely as a vulnerable group but as people with agency, dignity and the communal strength to resist the nefarious forces that attempt to exile them from the only country they know as home.
“This film is based on real events, making it emotional and timely, but at the same time it’s a suspenseful journey from start to finish,“ said Dilcia Barrera, director of programming of LALIFF and a programmer for the Sundance Film Festival, where the film had its world premiere in January. “Cristina and Alex’s revolutionary vision is a call to arms, an inspiration, and a reminder that the best way to honor one’s community is to serve it.”
That mission of service is shared by LALIFF, the organizers believe, as a space for anyone who identifies within the concept of “Latinx” to showcase their audiovisual work. The event started in 1997, spearheaded by Oscar-nominated Chicano actor Edward James Olmos, and positioned itself as an annual staple in the city’s festival landscape until its abrupt and shaky departure from 2014 till 2018. It returned last year in a renewed incarnation that included newly implemented music and episodic sections.
“It’s been difficult to let them know we’ve returned. It will take time, but we are here to put in the work — our community deserves it,” said Rafael Agustín, LALIFF’s executive director, about the challenge of bringing back the audiences that once were loyal to the festival.
For 2019, LALIFF is adding an animation master class to tap into a medium where Latinx creators are gaining prominence, and it’s focusing its sights on Latinx works, those conceived by U.S.-born or -raised artists with Latin American roots. “The Infiltrators” will kick off a program composed of 17 feature-length films, 10 of which were directed or co-directed by women, and several shorts programs that also exalt the complex Latinx identity. Latin American productions are included (Brazil’s provocative “Divine Love,” Uruguay’s coming-of-ager “The Sharks”) but homegrown talent is the priority.
Ivete Lucas and Patrick Bresnan’s documentary “Pahokee,” zeroing in on the lives of a diverse group of high school seniors in Florida, and Diana Peralta’s “De Lo Mio,” following two American sisters as they grapple with their conflicted relationship with the Dominican_Republic, are among the Latinx features screening July 31-Aug. 4 at the TCL Chinese multiplex. The drama “I’ll See You Around,” a first feature by Daniel Fermin Pfeffer, and Rashaad Ernesto Green’s romantic vision “Premature” also are included. The world premiere of “The Devil Has a Name,” directed by Olmos, is the festival’s closing-night film.
The blanket term Latinx often is used to refer to those originally from Latin America and the U.S.-born population of Latin American descent, but though these two segments have inextricable links, their experiences are distinct; more important, they have different levels of access to sharing their stories. Latinx creators don’t have access to government funding as many of their counterparts from the rest of the Americas do, hence the fact that festivals around the world are crowded with Latin American movies, but rarely feature U.S. Latinos.
“In order to accurately address what is happening in our industry, we must distinguish the Latin American voice from the U.S. Latinx voice,” explained Barrera. “LALIFF acknowledges the structural differences between the Latin American film industry and U.S.-based productions and is actively participating in reform by introducing a space dedicated to celebrating and highlighting U.S. Latinx narratives and talent.”
Although the industry at large is beginning to show glimpses of progress as Latinx and Latin American storytellers fight to break through, for Agustín the change isn’t coming fast enough, especially to film. Conversely, television, with shows like “One Day at a Time” and “Vida,” has been more receptive to addressing the abysmal lack of inclusion.
“We aren’t advancing as much as we should be — not by how much we over-index the movie, TV, online and mobile content viewership,” Agustin noted. “But where the film industry has historically failed us, I believe TV now has an opportunity to do right by us.” A staff writer on “Jane the Virgin, “ which coincidentally aired its final episode on Tuesday, Agustín is of the view that episodic content, where writers have the biggest influence, is where emerging Latinx creators can find a platform for their stories. With that in mind, LALIFF’s episodic section has become a crucial component of the event.
Ahead of this year’s edition, Barrera is confident that LALIFF can act as a one-stop shop for the industry to engage with Latinx pioneers and one-of-a-kind visionaries. “The filmmakers we are showcasing are the next generation of Hollywood storytellers,” she ensures."

Review: ‘Dora and the Lost City of Gold’ gives us the Latinx heroine we need right now
BY KATIE WALSH

These days, there’s no intellectual property that hasn’t been mined for a big-budget, live-action Hollywood remake. But the adaptation of the popular educational kiddie cartoon “Dora the Explorer” into the summer-friendly romp “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” is a no-brainer.
The beloved character of Dora, with whom Gen Z grew up, becomes a winning 21st-century heroine in this perky action-adventure flick that pulls heavily from the “Indiana Jones” movies and other kid-friendly action-adventure classics.
To adapt the interactive kiddie show into something a bit more sophisticated to appeal to the preteen set who are no longer the preschool set, director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller (who cut their teeth in comedy and worked on 2011’s “The Muppets”) have brought a healthy dose of irony to the format. Their leading lady, Isabela Moner, proves to be more than up to the challenge of walking the fine line between sincere and silly in her performance.
“Can you say ‘neurotoxicity’?” she asks the audience in one of Dora’s signature direct addresses to the camera, with a wide-eyed and slightly manic enthusiasm that lets us know we’re all in on the joke.
Dora falls into that grand cinematic tradition of brave naïfs who embark on big adventures (see: Herman, Pee-wee). Dora has been brought up in the jungle by her professor parents (Eva Longoria and Michael Peña), and she knows everything about her surroundings. She just doesn’t know much about other people.
Her parents ship her off to “the city” to live with her aunt, uncle and cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) to study the indigenous culture of American high schools and pick up some social skills while they go off in search of Parapata, an ancient Incan city of gold.
The happy, open, completely guileless Dora might be able to survive the elements but it’s questionable whether she’ll survive high school. Diego is embarrassed by her, queen bee Sammy (Madeleine Madden) is threatened by her, and the school nerd (Nicholas Coombe) is enamored of her.
The quartet gets separated from the pack on a field trip, then kidnapped to South America by a group of bounty hunters hoping to use Dora to find her parents and swoop in on the treasure. Alejandro (Eugenio Derbez), an academic friend of Dora’s parents, rescues the kids, and they make a break for it into the jungle.
Moner’s layered comedic performance, which at once nods at the “Dora” formula while acknowledging the conceit, is deceptively difficult and nuanced. She cheerily sings songs about doing your business in the jungle while brandishing a shovel and breathlessly offers up fun facts. She’s delightfully dorky, a rare commodity in this day and age of sarcastic, wise-beyond-their-years teens.
In contrast, Derbez’s slapsticky style is practically vaudevillian, or even rodeo clownish, as he pulls faces and subjects his body to humiliation. It’s a jarring performance generation gap.
The action in this live-action adaptation is sanded down and decidedly safe. Bobin loses the geographical thread in the film’s climax in and around Parapata — but it’s never about the visual thrills, it’s about the girl at the center of it all.
When Dora explains they’re not treasure hunters but explorers there to learn, the jungle puzzle all clicks into place. Dora, with her backpack, sunny outlook and multicultural perspective, is truly the hero we need for this century."

Meet the teenage old souls making dreamy Latinx pop, from their bedroom to yours
BY RANDALL ROBERTS

One day a few years ago, Mauri Tapia, the artist who performs as Los Retros, was riding around Oxnard with his dad. The car stereo was turned up, blasting the stuff his parents typically played around the house, when Tapia had a realization. “He was playing Los Angeles Negros, Los Terricolas” — late-1960s ballad bands from, respectively, Chile and Venezuela — “and they had that drum sound that I liked.”
The tone, the younger Tapia realized, sounded similar to what contemporary electronic producers Daft Punk and Justice employed on some of Tapia’s favorite dance-floor bangers.
To his surprise, Tapia — now all of 19 — had another epiphany: “These songs aren’t that bad!”
For the last few years, a loosely connected musical movement has been germinating in bilingual bedrooms and living rooms across Southern California. Informed by, but not beholden to, border-blurring vintage balladry and soulful love songs, the sound is driven by young Latinx singers drawing on oldies for stylistic inspiration.
In north Pasadena, Jasper Bones, 21, delivers his self-described “wavy soul” sounds — and covers of Ritchie Valens songs — to an increasingly devoted fan base. The artist recently sold out a bigwig-heavy gig at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip.
Bones’ “wavy soul” tag could be given to any number of the artists mixing classic song structures with gentle, affectionate lyrics sung in English and Spanish, delivered as if not to disturb the rest of the family.
In Koreatown, Ambar Cruz, 18, who records under the stage name Ambar Lucid, has been harnessing attention gained from her SoundCloud hit “Letter to My Younger Self” to craft analog R&B for a new generation. San Marcos, Calif.-based sisters Emily and Sheyla Rosas, 22 and 17, perform as Dueto Dos Rosas and have been releasing a steady clip of stunning harmonized renditions of classic and obscure Mexican rancheras. Their next project: composing and singing bilingual songs with a similar feel.
Most famously of late, Hawthorne psychedelic pop romancer Cuco, 21, turned the 2017 viral success born of his cover of Santo & Johnny Farina’s 1959 instrumental “Sleepwalk” into a seven-figure deal with Universal Music. Last week, Cuco’s debut album, “Para Mi,” entered the Billboard album chart at No. 94.
A stellar sampling of this evolution, including Dueto Dos Rosas and Los Retros, will play at the annual Viva! Pomona music festival, an Inland Empire block party that celebrates the avalanche of underground Latinx sounds coming out of the region.
Perhaps most notably, the dashing young norteño singer Ed Maverick, whose sweet Spanish-language come-ons have propelled him onto the Mexican charts, will make his first-ever stateside performance. Pity the poor A&R exec who isn’t tuned to the Viva! frequency.
Though hardly Coachella, the Aug. 24-25 gathering has become an incubator for teen and 20-something talent less interested in pursuing beat-driven Latin pop or its American counterpart than digging into their parents’ and even grandparents’ record crates.
“The culture is instilled with that music, whether you know it or not,” says DJ and KCRW programmer Raul Campos, who, growing up, learned Spanish before he learned English. “You hear it and it’s just in your subconscious, these artists from back in the day that are traditional and classic. It’s very easy for that to ooze into the music.”
Sitting at a picnic table in the backyard of the house he grew up in, Bones stumbles as he tries to characterize the sound he hears emerging out of Southern California. “It’s new but at the same time nostalgic — which contributes to why it’s popping off.”
Next to him in the spacious yard is his parents’ garage, which is being converted into Bones’ future live-work space; he now records both in his ocean-blue bedroom and at a friend’s studio in the San Fernando Valley.
The artist, of Mexican and Guatemalan heritage, has been wrestling in his music with what he calls “the constant struggle of being too American for the traditional family, but then too Mexican or Guatemalan for modern-day American society.” He fit right in when he performed as part of the 2018 Viva! Pomona.
Currently working on his first new material since his “Cruise Control” EP in November, Bones cites classic Motown singles as a central influence. “The stuff that our parents, and their parents, put us on is definitely transparent in what we write.”
That vibe connecting cultures is hardly new, but it permeates “Oscuridad.” The artist’s 2017 breakout track moves with a casual fluidity. The handsome crooner sings, in Spanish and English verses, of a desire for love that “takes a bite outta my heart and consumes me.” He does so to the accompaniment of a samba-esque strummed electric guitar and little else. The song recently surpassed 1 million spins on Spotify.
To arrive at his sound, Los Retros’ Tapia started reverse-engineering his favorite hip-hop and dance tracks to uncover the sampled source material, he says, sitting at a table at El Taco de Mexico in downtown Oxnard. A multi-instrumentalist who lives with his parents and siblings about a mile away, he learned to play drums and guitar in his bedroom — which doubles as the house’s living room.
After teaching himself basic recording techniques, Tapia ran his gear through an old four-track recorder and into free software and got to work. His epiphany: “I can do it myself. I don’t need to go looking for people to do it. I have it here at home.”
His first release, “Retrospect,” just came out on the beat-driven Highland Park imprint Stones Throw. Six easygoing seductions about various shades of love, lust and loneliness, the record mixes casual guitar lines, muffled percussion and thrift store keyboards. The result is songs that reference doo-wop (“Never Have Enough”) and sound like what oldies legend Art Laboe might have spun during a Saturday night slow dance (“Nostalgic Vibrations”).
Easing between languages, New Jersey transplant Ambar Lucid composes lyrics informed by her experience as a first-generation Mexican American whose father was deported when she was 5. After scoring her first acoustic guitar from a relative’s garage at age 11, she started sharing covers of Sia, Radiohead, Pierce the Veil and Selena Gomez songs.
“Music was always my way to cope,” Lucid says, sitting in a writing space in her Koreatown apartment, “and I wanted to be able to do something that would allow me to portray my feelings a little bit more.” She wrote her first song at 15 and, she says, “felt such a rush of creative satisfaction. I’d never felt so good doing something. I was like, ‘I’m going to keep doing this.’ ”
Lucid recorded them in private: “I would literally sit in the bathtub with my guitar and record them to voice memo.” After uploading a few of them to SoundCloud, she noted that complete strangers were listening. Many of them reached out after she uploaded “A Letter to My Younger Self,” a self-assured ode to patience and fate. That’s true of many independent artists who have found success on the platform, which enables them to find an audience without passing through gatekeepers. If, like Cuco, they accrue enough fans, the gate opens itself.
Among those listening to Lucid were some West Coast kindred spirits, and after visiting Los Angeles with her mother, she made her case for quitting high school, getting her GED and relocating, she says, to find “the creative freedom that I could have in being here.”
After moving across the country last year, Lucid fell in with a community that wanted, as Mija Management’s Jaz Vargas puts it, “to foster brown creatives. And not even exclusive to brown people, but there needed to be a space that encouraged that.”
On Sunday, Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter Kali Uchis, Cuco, Jasper Bones, Ambar Lucid and others will play a particularly prominent space: New York’s Central Park, as part of the SummerStage concert series. A benefit to support nonprofit immigrant-rights organizations, the high-profile event, called Selena for Sanctuary, is one of a series of initiatives to benefit those affected by the government’s hard-line immigration policies. Last year, a similar event occurred at Lincoln Center.
The concert is one indication to Bones that he’s been right to trust his gut. Not three years ago, he says, pointing to his old station wagon, “I would literally go to the parking lot in that Volvo — I didn’t have my new car — and I would just sit in the back and play guitar at school because I didn’t want my parents to find out I wasn’t going.”
His parents have since sanctioned his career path. Bones no longer has to practice his crooning from a bucket seat. Instead, he’s focused full-time on bringing into the world the mix of sounds running through his head. “It’s OK that I don’t fit into one category,” he’s concluded, “and as of late, a lot of other kids who feel like they’re in that same lane are proud of being there. We’re just doing our own thing.”"

Latinx, queer, punk. Club Scum exhibition captures the fierceness, in full
BY SHARON MIZOTA

Where can you paint your face like a beauty queen with a raw, bloody, monster’s maw? Sculpt a vulva on your bald head? Perform in a cow suit, complete with udder, and feel completely at home? At Club Scum, of course, the Latinx queer punk club in Montebello. The monthly party celebrates its third anniversary with an exhibition of photographs, video and ephemera at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena.
We hear much talk about “safe spaces” and “brave spaces,” where people are empowered to bring their whole selves without fear of discrimination or harassment. Club Scum was conceived by Rudy “Bleu” Garcia and Ray Sanchez as an alternative to the white-dominated drag and punk scenes in L.A. But “safe” and even “brave” don’t begin to capture the energy and spirit on view in this exhibition. Through the eyes of its documenters, Club Scum comes across as a “fierce space,” defiant and unapologetic. It doesn’t just cross boundaries; it transforms them.
The show opens with two display cases of fliers, postcards, photo booth photos, set lists, even a bathroom sign warning against “policing gender” that has been blessed with several sets of lipstick prints. One particularly striking flier by Taco Guillen features a shirtless, tattooed figure holding what looks like a reliquary box. One of the figure’s eyes is blissfully closed; the other is staring and bloodied, its surrounding skin lined with cracks. The graphic sits perfectly at a nexus of horror, punk and transcendence.
Most of the exhibition is given over to photographs. Daniel “Chino” Rodriguez contributes a wall of snapshots overlapping in an unruly onslaught that echoes the abundance they document: crowded dance floors, teased hair, bombastic makeup, plus an accordion player. Anthony Mehlhaff’s images are more dramatic: Printed larger, in high-contrast black and white or saturated color, they elevate subjects like the crowd-surfing drag queen in “Drag Surfin’ USA” to beatific heights.
Amina Cruz’s photographs capture more intimate moments. “Blaue Tara” from 2017 depicts a mustachioed figure in full makeup and a mesh tank top, topped off with a jeweled collar and bralette. The subject holds a cigarette and looks to one side, lips parted, caught in a moment of stillness. Against a nearly solid black ground, the figure’s long blond hair forms a soft, fuzzy halo.
At the end of the gallery, in the center of a wall plastered with fliers, is a video compilation produced by Brian Johanson and Sarahjane Pattwell. Here, the performers, dancers and revelers really come to life as we get a better sense not only of the humble, crowded space in which these celebrations occur, but of the fierce, free spaces they create."

Calendar letters to the editor: Young Latinx musicians are carrying on a tradition

Regarding “They Call it ‘Wavy Soul’” by Randall Roberts [Aug. 18]: A most welcome trend: Young Latinx artists like Jasper Bones and Cuco lately have covered the likes of 1950s hit makers Ritchie Valens (“We Belong Together”) and Santo & Johnny (“Sleepwalk”).
We postwar baby boomers know well that mining prior generations’ pop music favorites for stylistic inspiration is nothing new. For example, the 1930s produced many hit songs that were covered about a quarter-century later — such as “I Only Have Eyes for You” (1959, the Flamingos); “Georgia on My Mind” (1960, Ray Charles); “Blue Moon” (1961, the Marcels) — and they became oldies standards.
Here’s hoping that Bones, Cuco, et al. continue their retrospective adaptations.

Checking in on LACMA issues
Thank you to Mary McNamara for writing about your recent visit to LACMA [“LACMA, Just Admit You are a Ghost Town,” Aug. 24] highlighting its ghostly presence and sad state of affairs.
As a former member I have followed closely the news covering changing plans for a new building, shrinkage of space for displaying its collections, plans to mount small exhibits in other parts of Los Angeles, plans to locate curators across Wilshire Blvd., etc. I can only wonder at the thinking going into these decisions. Despite the approval of the Board of Supervisors to put city money into this ill-fated project and slow-going private donations, it is curious that significant arts professionals were not listened to.
I don’t know whether it is too late to make modifications that will preserve one of L.A.’s great and important cultural resources, but I do wish something could be done.
J.C. Atkin
Long Beach
I want to thank you for your coverage of the LACMA situation. I too purchased a dual membership and just visited the museum last week. It was painful to read your very fair and objective treatment because while I want to rationalize the high admission price and vastly reduced collection as the cost of moving forward, you force me to keep forward my concerns about both the new building in general, and the manner in which the transition is being managed. I do think the special exhibits are quite good right now.
Herbert Moses
Huntington Beach
Where have you been? You are late to the party. Your own paper has kept us informed about the closure plans. These are exciting times at LACMA and a time to support the effort to build a 21st century museum. I will continue to support LACMA at my current level and hope to be here when it reopens. I am 76.

Changes worthy of an applause
Regarding “Aloof Music Center Warms Up” [Aug. 25]: Welton Becket’s design of the Music Center is wonderful. The Pavilion could be used more effectively, but high on a hill is lovely.
B. Soderstrom
Irvine
I applaud the intention to make the space more inviting and the decision to renovate without blowing up existing structures or running up massive costs.
LACMA, are you listening? In the 21st century, progressive design conserves financial and natural resources and honors its physical and cultural context.
LACMA’s grandiose, zillion-dollar revamp of the County Museum of Art forces an already outmoded design on a beloved public space, casts a shadow across Wilshire Boulevard and undermines the purpose of the institution.
This is the perfect time to step back from the brink.
Shelley Wagers
Los Angeles
Make planning part of redesign
Regarding “Tar Pits Redesigns Bubble Up” [Aug. 27]: The current LACMA campus evolved into a hodgepodge of uncomplimentary designs dictated by the pocketbooks of major named donors, obsequious museum directors ceding to their whims, and whatever architectural style was in vogue at that time.
Now, must our city suffer another disjointed design for the Page Museum that, in all likelihood, will not complement the atrocious project that is proposed for LACMA? There is a magic word called “planning,” which the trustees of the Page and LACMA must demand of the two design firms.

Reviewer biases easy to spot
Regarding “‘Our Boys’ Walks a Political Tightrope,” by Lorraine Ali [Aug. 25]: The horrific killing of a young Palestinian teen at the hands of Israeli zealots, as portrayed in “Our Boys,” pushes aside, for the most part, the equally brutal abduction and murder of three Israeli teenage boys that preceded the event. Israelis as a whole were in disbelief that one of their own was capable of such brutality and a manhunt for those responsible was immediately mounted. “Our Boys” portrays the grieving Palestinian parents with deep sensitivity. The parents of the Israeli teens are glimpsed briefly through original footage blurred, distant and impersonally.
Doubtless there were Jews and Arabs alike, disgusted and horrified by these senseless killings, but when it comes to the pursuit of justice from the leaders of these two peoples there is absolutely no moral equivalence, a serious omission as portrayed (so far) in the series.
As for Lorraine Ali, she passes up no opportunity to insert her political biases into her entertainment reviews. Perhaps she is ready for the Opinion page.
Pauline Regev
Santa Monica
I have been watching the series “Our Boys.” I recall the incidents and am impressed with the professionalism of the series, the dedication of the writers and the actors. I have deep sympathy for Mohammed’s parents, but where are the parents of the slain Israeli children that set off this horrific cycle of violence and revenge? The abduction of the three Israeli boys is barely mentioned, and their equally bereaved parents not at all. I wish Lorraine Ali’s article could have been as even-handed as the series.

A fact check on ‘Thrones’
In “Running the Show: Twists in a Fantasy Career” by Yvonne Villarreal [Aug. 25], showrunner Marc Guggenheim says it’s not fair comparing “Game of Thrones” to “Carnival Row” because the feature spec script to “Carnival Row” was written “17 years ago, long before there was even a “Game of Thrones” novel.”
“A Game of Thrones” was first published 23 years ago by Bantam Spectra (U.S.) and in 1996 by Voyager Books (U.K.).

It’s a relatable kind of ‘Power’
Regarding Greg Braxton’s “A Final ‘Power’ Surge“ [Aug. 24]: “Power” brings you into the story.
I can relate to all the characters in the story line, love, hate, fear while feeling connected to everything and everyone doing what they do. The love scenes between Ghost and Angela were epic. Tommy is the loyal erratic friend you don’t want to become your enemy. The total cast of characters in “Power” is believable. I feel like I know Ghost, Angela, Tommy and Tasha just as well as I know the people I have coffee with at Starbucks.
Can’t wait until Sunday night.

Hollywood
Gotta dance
Regarding the online story “Male Dancers Teach Lara Spencer a Ballet Lesson After Her Prince George Joke” by Christie D’Zurila [Aug. 26]: When I was very young I loved dancing and took some ballet, some tap, some jazz. I was called names by people all through high school.
Later, I was in “On Your Toes” on Broadway. It’s a classic, about a comic rivalry between ballet and Broadway-style dance. We took ballet class in the mornings led by a NYC Ballet mistress. The dancers were from ABT, Joffrey and the Bolshoi. 
It was moving, magical, a seminal time for me. Dance helped me grow into manhood. And it gave me empathy for boys whose desire to dance was actually dangerous for them. Think of that: dangerous.
So this deeply shallow and foolish Lara Spencer thing has everyone angry, as it should. I’m now a psychotherapist and these experiences affect how I try to have empathy and understanding. Dance teaches that.

More hippie story fallout
I read with dismay Tom Carson’s treatment of Woodstock and his conflation of that with Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” in “The Hippie Reckoning” [Aug. 18]. As a believer in the ‘60s (I wonder if Carson can claim the same), I felt the sincerity of so many young people of that time and the longing for a society that valued above all such values as sharing as opposed to greed, peace as opposed to war and violence, love as opposed to fear and suspicion.
This cynical article by Carson is a sign of our current times, not a sign of the best values of the ‘60s. In Trump’s era of the peddling of fear, hate, and division, we would do well to emulate the best and deeply-felt instincts of ‘60s youth.
Roger Owens
Laguna Beach
I’m so tired of liberals who have to drag President Trump into every conversation. In a letter about Tom Carson’s “Hippie Reckoning” [“Calendar Feedback”, Aug. 25] a reader stated “...makes me wonder if Carson didn’t vote for Trump.” Don’t forget the millions of us who voted for him and still support him. We’re still here.
Sharon Welch
Rancho Cucamonga
The two questions he addressed to any 1960s Hippies regarding our lifestyle choices: ”Did it make [me] happy? Did it change [my] life?”
Well, yes and no.
The creative spirit and freedom of the era was something to experience. The music of both Woodstock, in particular, and the era, in general, was magnificent. Questioning traditional Western civilization, culture, and materialism had some validity. But, the answer was not a drug infused euphoria exemplified at Woodstock and liberally indulged in by youth.
I bought the whole Hippie mantra of “Freedom Without Responsibility” hook, line, and sinker. This ridiculous notion only held a semblance of truth or reality because one was stoned. It led to several regrettable decisions that effected my past and current life adversely.
So, was it “fun”? yes, but, I paid the price.
Rick Solomon
Lake Balboa
Yes, the ‘60s made us ‘happy’ not hedonistic. As it provided the salient touchstone to act with and on conscience. Something that has terrbily waned in its aftermath.
Woodstock was an unrivaled, archtypical mass “Cultural Contruct” vice “Media Construct.” which shaped all future collective iterations. One can be forgiven in this age of internet to loosely deem everything a ‘Media Construct.”

The term “hippie” was coined by the media. Real hippies thought anyone who called themselves hippies were squares.

Meet the Long Beach artist fighting for Latinx farmworkers and their legacies
BY CHRISTI CARRAS

The stark white walls of the Long Beach Museum of Art Downtown are lined with color. Paintings depicting neighborhood landscapes and tropical fish hang on the perimeter, while glazed pottery sparkles center stage. But tucked away in a corner is perhaps the most vibrant piece of all — a tower of discarded cardboard boxes.
Used produce boxes are the medium of choice for Long Beach artist Narsiso Martinez. Drawing on his experience in the fields as a farmworker, Martinez, 41, etches the faces of his community above the glamorized fruits of their labor “to have a conversation between the farm workers and the agricultural industry.”
The 3-D project, “Friends in Freshness,” is on display through Nov. 3 at the newly reopened LBMA Downtown and will be featured at Saturday’s grand opening celebration.
“I wanted to represent their contribution,” Martinez said. “I feel like these individuals deserve fair treatment, fair opportunities as well. I worked for many years in the fields. … We exchanged stories. I heard their stories, and the struggle is real, and they are working really hard.”
While Martinez’s pieces have focused on farmworkers for several years, his artistic vision wasn’t always 20/20. He started like many creatives do, painting portraits of neighbors or celebrities in magazines — until his first art history class at Los Angeles City College exposed him to the works of Vincent van Gogh.
“I got inspired by seeing his peasant scenes, his agricultural landscapes, and I was like, ‘Damn, I want to paint stuff like this,’” Martinez said. “There’s this feeling of familiarity I had when I saw his paintings, and I felt like I wanted to do something like that.”
That’s when Martinez decided he wanted to study art, starting with his undergraduate education at Cal State Long Beach. But his first semester hit hard. Though school was his passion, it was also a crippling financial burden.
“I almost gave up on school,” he said. “I told my family, maybe I was not going to go anymore because it was too expensive.”
His family’s proposed solution would later become the impetus for his most personal artistic expression. In order to pay for classes during the academic year, Martinez spent his summers picking fruit in the fields of Washington orchards.
Growing up in Oaxaca, Mexico, Martinez was no stranger to field work. But joining his brothers and sister on the front picking lines of corporate America was a different beast. Sometimes he spent more than half a day hunched over in the summer sun, pulling asparagus from 1 a.m. to 3 p.m. for just cents per pound. If the lengths of each plant failed to match exactly what the orchards wanted, they would be discarded, the dead weight taken out of his paycheck.
“It was unfair, but at that time I didn’t know,” Martinez said. “I was just barely starting. I didn’t know. And I started questioning all these things.”
Some of Martinez’s co-workers would later become his subjects for “Friends in Freshness.” One side of his cardboard puzzle depicts a woman who, with her husband, came to “rescue” Martinez by lending her hands at the end of a 14-plus-hour workday. Her husband was later deported to Mexico, leaving her to raise her children on her own. Martinez remembers her as one of the fastest and hardest-working pickers he’s ever seen, “whether it was cherries, asparagus or apples.”
Hers is the kind of story Martinez wants to tell in order to combat dangerous rhetoric swirling around the working-class Latinx community in America.
“When the now-president was campaigning ... I remember all those negative comments about Latino people,” Martinez said. “I really wanted to show the contribution of the Latino people, of this particular group of workers, to the economy. And I was thinking, how can I do that?”
While gathering research for “Friends in Freshness,” Martinez strove to learn more about the American farmworking community and culture — a culture he once rejected for fear of living in the past. Up until graduate school at Cal State Long Beach, his education had taught him to “move forward,” and he sought to leave his Oaxacan roots behind.
But the more time he spent with his co-workers, the more he came to appreciate their way of life, surrendering himself to the familiar and somber sounds of Mexican corridos.
“I started to listen to the music they listen to and go to the kind of events that they go to,” Martinez said. “And so in that way, we’d kind of share stories, and those stories became part of the artwork ... I got to understand that it’s their identity. That’s what gives them a sense of unity.”
Going back and forth between the orchards and Cal State Long Beach, Martinez often found himself code-switching when interacting with farmworkers versus grad students. He wants his art, however, to translate to everyone — not just an elite crowd of art lovers. At one point in Martinez’s graduate education, some suggested he take a more abstract approach to his creations, zooming in on just the farmworkers’ skin. He went against their advice.
“It would have worked if I was going to be there to explain it or if I had written something that would say, ‘These crazy marks are pores from the skin of a farmworker,’” Martinez said. “But maybe if it was in English, the farmworkers wouldn’t be able to understand it. So for me it was really important that the farmworkers were included in the process.”
Now he hopes those who experience his piece can appreciate the American farmworking community as he did in his artistic and personal journey — and as the LBMA did when it first decided to take him on as a resident in 2018.
“There was a compelling story that went along with his pieces, and I really realized there’s a lot going on in there, and there were some cultural differences that I think, in the beginning, he was uncomfortable with, but it’s really wonderful the way he’s learned to speak about his life,” said Ronald Nelson, executive director of the LBMA. “Every image that he does, he knows the person, and he’s painted them for a reason.”
Through all the hurdles, Martinez never doubted his mission to shed light on farmworkers, a group that has long been invisible to those who benefit from them. At the freshly restored LBMA Downtown, they are visible to the California public, illuminated in charcoal.
“There’s already progress because we are acknowledging them, and we’re seeing them,” Martinez said. “Maybe when they go to the grocery store and think about it a little bit more … I think changes happen in little steps, and I hope that this is part of it.”"

Opinion: How the invisibility of Latinx people in media is enabling Trump’s bigotry
BY GREGORY NAVA

It was a time of economic struggle and xenophobia. Sitting in the White House was a businessman who had never before held public office. His slogan and rallying cry was unsubtle and racially coded: “American jobs for real Americans.”
His name was not Donald Trump, but Herbert Hoover. And, like Trump, he followed up on his threats. During the Great Depression, the Hoover administration, in order to create jobs for “real” Americans, started a policy in 1929 that illegally and unconstitutionally deported 1.8 million Latino men, women and children, 60% of whom were U.S. citizens. The vast majority were given no due process. One of them was my grandfather, Incarnación Nava.
Incarnación was a refugee who fled the violence of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 and journeyed to el norte — the United States. He was granted asylum and became a legal resident the same year. He worked in a smelting factory, lived here for more than 20 years, got married and started a large family, which was forever shattered by his unjust deportation in 1931.
My grandmother, Raquel, was forced to raise seven children alone; my father, Rudolph, was raised without a father; and my young Aunt Irene died needlessly from tuberculosis because her family, struggling without a breadwinner, could not pay for medical care. My grandfather died brokenhearted and alone in Mexico, separated from the family he loved.
The mass deportations that swept up my grandfather and nearly 2 million more like him are a disgraceful but largely forgotten chapter of American history.
Now this nightmare is happening all over again. How can that be? How can President Trump get away with and even gain pubic approval by scapegoating the Latinx community 90 years after President Hoover did?
To me, a filmmaker who has dedicated his life to making movies and television series that create an understanding and empathy of the Latinx American experience, the answer is simple: Latinos and Latinas have been rendered virtually invisible in popular culture. That invisibility is enabling history to repeat itself.
A recent study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative spells it out clearly and dismally: Latinos and Latinas are 20% of the U.S. population, but only 4.5% of the nearly 50,000 speaking or named characters parts in major movies over the last 12 years. And only 3% of those roles were lead or co-lead actors.
Even worse, when we are portrayed, too often we’re presented as criminals and “narcos.” The study’s conclusion is obvious: “At a time where Latinos in our country are facing intense concerns over their safety, we urgently need to see the Latino community authentically and accurately represented throughout entertainment.”
This erasure pains me deeply because I have seen the impact that storytelling can have on public opinion and enlightened public policy. I made my films “El Norte” (about siblings who, like my grandfather, flee war and violence in their homeland and make an arduous journey to the U.S. seeking sanctuary) and “Mi Familia” (which dramatizes the devastating consequences of the deportations of the 1930s) because I never wanted what happened to my grandfather and my family to happen again. I believed that by making these tragic situations real to all Americans, and giving voice to such stories, I could help end the demonization of Latinos and immigrants.
And these films did have an impact. “El Norte,” released in 1984, especially helped change the narrative of how immigrants were perceived. Both Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan mentioned the film in their presidential campaign debates, and it played a key role in the United States granting temporary protected status to Central American refugees. Likewise, the film was cited as an impetus for the passage of the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which resulted in millions of immigrants being granted citizenship.
But that was decades ago. Trump wants to rescind Central Americans’ hard-won protected status. He brands us as “criminals,” “rapists” and an “infestation,” while abuses against Latinos and Latinas regularly go dismissed and our triumphs and contributions are overlooked.
As I watch the news, I see my grandfather’s saga being played out over and over again; mass deportation raids, separated families, caged children, a wall built on fear. And, of course, the white supremacist-motivated massacre in El Paso.
The issue is bigger than the entertainment industry. The erasure of the Latinx American experience extends across all fields. We lack presence in journalism, in literature, in school curricula, on the news, in the arts and museums, and in politics. Latinos and Latinas must break down those doors.
Representation isn’t about quotas or statistics, it’s about touching hearts and opening minds. The Latinx community has to show our hearts to our nation and the world, so that what happened to my grandfather, what’s happening on the southern border and what happened in El Paso can never happen again."

Review: ‘Prescience’ muddles journey of self-discovery for a gay Latinx man
BY CARLOS AGUILAR

Even if genuinely pursing diverse representation, James Helsing’s trite “Prescience” only warrants notoriety for turning a baffling screenplay into a poorly acted melodrama via a misused cast composed of rising talents and respected veterans such as Oscar-nominee Eric Roberts.
El_Salvadoran actor René Mena, seen often in major studio fare and who serves as co-writer on this production, despite lacking subtlety in his rendition, defies stereotypes as attorney Isaac Smith, adopted by a white family as a child alongside his sister, Emily (Vannessa Vasquez). Unwilling to accept his sexual orientation, Isaac must grapple with the desires that his new roommate Mark (a decent Mike C. Manning) has awakened.
Cringe-worthy lines of dialogue share the movie’s soundscape with an overbearing score as the ensemble trots through woefully uninspired flashbacks and erotic dream sequences. An upbringing stained by his parents’ deportation and sexual abuse further complicates the meek lead’s self-discovery. Fortunately, as a point in the movie’s favor, the filmmakers don’t correlate homosexuality with trauma.
Awfully bewildering till the end, a final bombshell catapults the persistently nonsensical plot onto a level of implausibility that defies basic logic and ethics.
Latinx creators getting access to hone their audiovisual storytelling skills should always strike as a positive — and there are many of them below the line here — though content so crudely crafted almost qualifies as a setback."

She photographs Latinx tribute artists through an LGBTQ lens
BY ELIFETE PAZ

For her new photography series “Caricias,” Arlene Mejorado sees herself as not only an artist but more important, as a collaborator, a curator and a friend to the people she’s photographing: LGBTQ people, primarily trans women, who perform as Selena Quintanilla, Jenni Rivera, Juan Gabriel and others at nightclubs, restaurants and backyard tent parties all across Los Angeles.
Mejorado eschews decisive moments for empathetic context, weaving interviews, portraits and autobiography into a multimedia series that gives testimony to the cathartic power of these LGBTQ drag performances.
“I’m interested in back story versus being the storyteller who offers the narrative of a photo,” she said.
For strict documentarians drawn to larger-than-life moments that speak without context, work like Mejorado’s might be easy to dismiss. And for the artist herself, acceptance hasn’t always been easy. When Mejorado, 31, was in New York last summer for a Magnum Foundation fellowship, she arranged to workshop her project at the home of photographer Joseph Rodríguez. Mejorado, who is self-taught, was feeling overwhelmed. Round-the-clock group critiques and classes can rack any artist with self-doubt. For Mejorado, questions of belonging were accompanied by questions of skill, and whether her approach was good enough.
Rodríguez sat her beside his books of great Latin American photographers: Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Graciela Iturbide. What Mejorado needed, Rodríguez told her, was to accept that she saw the world as they did. She was not an outsider to photography. She had a home.
In trying to imagine a life in the arts, Mejorado had no example in her family — shoemakers who left Mexico in the 1980s. As a kid in Panorama City, she sought approval from her older male cousins, doing whatever they did but still never being fully accepted. “You’re a girl,” Mejorado remembered her cousins saying.
In her early 20s, Mejorado, who identifies as queer, almost gave up on the arts entirely. But then she met Margaret Garcia, a portraitist in Highland Park who opened her studio on Thursday nights to the neighborhood. Mejorado was challenged to paint fast. Garcia’s models had families to feed, jobs. Mejorado gathered what was conspicuous, finding beauty in strong features.
Then in 2008 Garcia took Mejorado to a talk at the Getty, where they met Iturbide. Meeting Iturbide, much like seeing her books at Rodríguez’s, reinvigorated Mejorado with confidence. By 2016, she won some national recognition: A portrait of Mejorado’s was made into a graphic by Shepard Fairey titled “Defend Dignity” and seen prominently at the 2017 Women’s March.
Mejorado thinks forgetting can be a salve to trauma. With “Caricias” she asks her collaborators to remember, to share stories of their past, to resurface, say, a photograph tucked away in a shoe box. Mejorado collages these found photographs with backdrops of sequins and silk, fabrics used by the performers for their dresses and jackets. A doubling of time — a snapshot of a long-ago Christmas, placed atop present-day context — becomes evidence of then and now, giving performers breath to shape their own narrative.
Mejorado makes candid portraits of the performers while they’re on the stage, and she directs quieter ones off of it. They are posed, stilled, offering another thread into a performer’s life.
The photographer also is drawn to ruptures of etiquette. In her pictures of quinceañeras, baptisms and First Communion celebrations, a few men grope performers from behind or stuff dollar bills into the seams of costumes while family members of all ages are recording with their phones.
“I don’t believe in being a fly on the wall,” Mejorado said of her immersion into a scene. “I do take up space.”
And just as well. She gives performers a say in how they are shown, and they in turn give Mejorado tips on mise-en-scène and tone.
Lately, the pre-colonial god Tezcatlipoca, translated as the Smoking Mirror from Nahuatl, has been on Mejorado’s mind. She has been thinking about how we are reflections of one another, seeing ourselves, good or bad, in somebody else.
“I want to create reflections, not representations,” she said. “I want you to see yourself in someone, even though that someone might look nothing like you.”
In “Caricias,” the aim is to reflect the emotional labor of the performers.
Many of them migrated from Central America or Mexico to escape abuse or poverty. They carry a lineage of hurt and heartbreak. In the U.S., where some find a chosen family and earn good money, abuse and alienation can still follow. Yet while onstage, some of the performers are able to joke nonchalantly about rape or coyotes or racism. Then, like a spring bloom, song: “Como la Flor,” “Hasta Que Te Conocí,” “Paloma Negra.” “Like the Flower,” “Until I Met You,” “Black Dove.”
In some photographs, the crowd is transcendent — applauding, crying, as though they have seen Selena resurrected.
The series is incisive when critiquing the families who are paying for the entertainment. Mejorado is still waiting for a moment when the performer is treated as neither a curiosity nor a savior but rather a friend or ordinary human being. Will it ever happen? In some photographs, men recoil at the performer’s caress (the English translation of caricia).
For the performers, the stage provides a brief spell in which trauma fades. In song, they are embodiments of joy and heartbreak, channeling grace. “But there’s still this sense of them being an outsider,” Mejorado said, “They’re never at home.”"

‘American Dirt’ publisher vows to increase Latinx staff, published authors
BY DORANY PINEDA

Less than a week after canceling Jeanine Cummins’ entire “American Dirt” book tour and acknowledging “deep inadequacies” in the rollout of its bestseller, the publishing company appears to be making changes, or at least promising them.
A group of Latinx activists met on Monday with officials at Macmillan, the international parent company of Flatiron Books, which published “American Dirt,” to deliberate over steps the publisher could take to increase Latino representation in the industry.
After the meeting, #DignidadLiteraria and presente.org, an online Latinx organizing group, released a statement detailing the “unprecedented commitments” Macmillan made after the two-hour meeting.
According to the release, the publisher made commitments to “substantially increasing Latinx representation across Macmillan, including authors, titles, staff and its overall literary ecosystem” as well as “developing an action plan to address these objectives within 90 days.” Macmillan also said it would “regroup within 30 days with #DignidadLiteraria and other Latinx groups to assess progress.”
This week, #DignidadLiteraria and its allies will also be organizing action forums in several cities across the country, including a Thursday discussion at Antioch University in Culver City featuring Roxane Gay, Myriam Gurba, Wendy C. Ortiz and Romeo Guzman. The purpose of these panels is “to continue the conversation on Latinos and the publishing industry,” said Roberto Lovato, a writer and co-founder of the hashtag and group that arose in the wake of the outcry.
In a statement to The Times on Tuesday, Flatiron Books confirmed the wording of the agreement, adding that publishers “felt the meeting was quite productive.”
Cummins’ migrant tale “American Dirt” sparked a raging storm of controversy over the past few weeks. Published on Jan. 21, the book has been accused by critics of being a harmful act of cultural appropriation, riddled with cultural inaccuracies and stereotypes about Mexico and the struggles of migrants. It inspired snarky parodies on Twitter and sparked discussions about how far the publishing industry still had to go to represent the diversity of the Latino experience.
Still, the novel was warmly received by prominent writers, including Stephen King, John Grisham and Sandra Cisneros, who reaffirmed her support of the book in an exclusive interview last week.
Among the meeting attendees were Bob Miller and Don Weisberg, presidents of Flatiron Books and Macmillan, respectively; Amy Einhorn, the editor of “American Dirt”; representatives of Oprah Winfrey; and authors and #DignidadLiteraria founders David Bowles and Gurba. Gurba’s negative review of the book was the catalyst of the controversy.
#DignidadLiteraria is “a network of committed Latinx authors formed to combat the invisibility of Latinx authors, editors, and executives in the U.S. publishing industry and the dearth of Latinx literature on the shelves of America’s bookstores and libraries,” according to its founders.
It’s also a movement fueled by the publishing world’s lack of representation. Latinos are the largest minority voting group in the U.S. and the largest nonwhite demographic, but in 2018 they made up only 3% of the publishing workforce, according to a Publishers Weekly study from last year.
Though Bowles called the commitments “a clear victory” in a video posted on Twitter, #DignidadLiteraria emphasized that the publishing world had a long way to go, urged government officials to investigate the “homogeneity” of the industry and encouraged the public to demand more Latinx voices in books.
Monday’s announcement “is just the first step in what must ultimately be a sea change in publishing,” the group said in the statement. “This campaign is not simply about Flatiron Books, or Macmillan USA. It’s about seeking change that reverberates through the entire industry so the shelves of U.S. bookstores and libraries reflect its people.”
According to Bowles, Macmillan officials conceded during the meeting that Cummins had not received death threats. When Flatiron Books President Bob Miller announced in a statement that they were canceling the book tour, they cited “safety” concerns over “threats of physical violence.”
When asked about the threats, a spokesperson for Macmillan responded: ""[O]ur original statement is accurate. We never characterized the threats both booksellers and Jeanine received as ‘death threats.’”
Now that Latinos have the publishing world’s attention, Lovato believes that the public is “watching the beginning of the end of the folkloric industrial complex in Latino literature.”"

Painter Shizu Saldamando puts a face to L.A.'s Latinx art and punk scenes
BY CAROLINA A. MIRANDA

To be in a gallery filled with portraits by Shizu Saldamando is to stand by her side at a rowdy concert or to observe the casual encounters among her circle of friends. There are laughs and kisses and surges of sweaty bodies as they rush a stage. There is the smoking of cigarettes; there are moments marinated in booze. There are the intimate choreographies of longtime friendships: embraces, exchanged whispers, passing glances.
For more than two decades, the Los Angeles painter has captured the people in her midst. In her 20s and 30s, they were the flamboyant poets and punks she hung out with in the city’s underground music scenes. Now, at 41, and the mother of a 3-year-old son, her portraits have calmed, frequently focusing on her circle of artist friends.
“I was doing a show once and [the organizers] told me they were interested in my youth subculture paintings,” Saldamando says. “I had to explain that I wasn’t trying to be about youth subculture. It was just my life. Now I’ve gravitated to more professional artists. It’s still personal, about who my friends are and who I admire.”
It’s a gusty Friday afternoon in L.A., and Saldamando is decked out in a pair of overalls, overseeing installation of her solo exhibition “L.A. Intersections” at Oxy Arts, the cultural space run by Occidental College in Highland Park, where Saldamando is an artist in residence.
From the walls, a bevy of recognizable L.A. artists gaze over her: performance and installation artist Rafa Esparza, painter Ramiro Gomez, poet Raquel Gutiérrez, artist and archivist Guadalupe Rosales, finely rendered in paint and ink and colored pencil on un-primed materials, such as pieces of wood panel that reveal the grain of the tree — a pattern that has the effect of serving as abstracted landscape.
For the artist, the paintings are as much about capturing her milieu as they are about representation — a way to insert images of her hybrid Latinx and Asian identities into a culture where these are often rendered as foreign, when they are rendered at all. (Saldamando is the daughter of a Chicano father and a Japanese American mother.)
“When I started doing portraits in art school, I was hyper-aware of exoticization issues, being an Asian woman,” she says. “I’m not trying to do some Larry Clark ‘look-at-these-kids’ thing.”
Instead, in choosing to depict the people around her, she aims to rewrite some of the narratives that exist.
“Do we need more images and more paintings of the struggling immigrant?” she asks rhetorically. “That’s a huge narrative. ... There is more to the Latinx experience than trauma.”
Saldamando updates that narrative, often featuring racially ambiguous figures in band shirts and black leather jackets, hair rendered in chemical shades of blue, green and pink. They are the everypunks of cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston and San Francisco. They could not be more American. And they could not be more full of life.
“There is this intimacy to her drawings and paintings which bring you into these vulnerable moments with her subjects,” says Oxy Arts director Meldia Yesayan. “But she creates this reverential distance as well. She can harmonize form, light and space in a way that really captures you. I really appreciate her influences: Pop, Minimalism, street art, old master portraiture. It’s really unique.”
Saldamando rose to prominence in the exhibition “Phantom Sightings: Art After the Chicano Movement,” which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2008. The show, organized by curators Rita Gonzalez, Chon Noriega and Howard Fox, examined a generation of Chicano artists whose work echoed conceptual art movements, along with the countercultural revolutions of the 1960s and ‘70s.
Saldamando’s contribution to that show included painted portraits on wood, the format for which she is best known. But it also included a series of innovative works inspired by paño art, the ballpoint-on-handkerchief drawings that are a staple of prison art. In their original form, these frequently carry the signifiers of Chicano and cholo cultures, including Aztec imagery and Old English lettering.
Her versions featured neat renderings of New Wave musicians such as Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees. It was as much a nod to obscure forms of art-making as it was to popular culture. What her work proposed, noted the catalog essay on her work for “Phantom Sightings,” is “a decidedly contemporary take on portraiture.”
The diversity of influences, to some degree, speaks to Saldamando’s roots.
Born in San Francisco, she grew up in the Mission District before the neighborhood became a playground for the tech industry. “I’m like a unicorn,” she says. “I’m from the actual city.”
Her mother came from a Japanese American family that for a time lived in Boyle Heights but had their lives turned upside down when World War II came around and they were shipped off to internment camps.
“They were at Santa Anita Race Track and then Arkansas,” Saldmando says. Her mother was conceived at the Rohwer War Relocation Center and was born in Chicago. The family relocated back to Los Angeles when she was 13. “My mom’s family is still dealing with it. It was so traumatic.”
It’s a legacy the artist also pays tribute to with her work: Saldamando regularly leads craft sessions in which she teaches others how to make paper flower wreaths, the same kind used to bury the dead at internment camps, where fresh flowers were unavailable.
Her mother and father met in Los Angeles (he is originally from Nogales, Ariz.) but soon relocated to San Francisco, where they worked as a community organizer and pro bono lawyer for Catholic Charities, respectively. “He was working with Central Americans who were fleeing torture,” Saldamando says. “The Mission District was heavily Central American.”
Her mixed heritage and San Francisco location exposed Saldamando to an array of art-making traditions.
As a young girl, she was often taken to her mother‘s work, where Saldamando would occupy herself with a notebook and pencils. As she got older, she became a regular at neighborhood artistic outposts such as the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts and Galería de la Raza, an artist-run space established by Chicano artists in 1970.
Chicano art has always been an area of intense interest to her: “I’m interested in people. And the interest in Chicano art is because it has been very figurative. Seeing yourself — representation is important.”
But she has been just as interested in investigating its more marginal forms. “I would see a lot of prison art and I would read ‘Teen Angel,’” she says. “I was watching [the TV series] ‘Gangland’ — that had so much influence. There was cholo art I was influenced by. We’d try to copy the ballpoint pen drawings we would see.”
By high school, she was regularly making portraits of friends, often using colored pencils and ballpoint pens, often laced with stylized lettering, a service for which she would charge.
After high school, Saldamando moved to Los Angeles to complete her undergraduate studies at UCLA. She followed that with a master of fine art at CalArts, which she completed in 2005. But just as influential to her painting as her education was her immersion in L.A.'s music scene.
“The club scene in L.A. in the mid-'90s was so crazy,” she says. “Club Bang, Perversion, Satellite — which was Dark Wave. Club London at Vertigo. They were predominantly Latinx. “
Saldamando loved the music but also what the clubs represented: “Music is people coming together and connecting and getting crazy and releasing trauma. It’s a communal thing — to get drunk and release tension.”
Armed with a camera, Saldamando would often photograph friends out on the town, in the middle of riotous concerts and crashing out after parties. These would frequently become the basis of paintings. She was fascinated by gesture and body language and the ways that people present themselves.
“I gravitate to people who construct themselves as high art,” she says. “They put themselves together in a style that they have honed out of economic necessity or cultural things. It’s people who are like art already.”
Over the years, myriad elements and materials have appeared in her work. Fragments of reflective stickers and bright Japanese washi yuzen papers appear as collage. She has used glitter and cardboard to add texture to works painted on wood or on paper. Bedsheets and tablecloths become canvases. In addition to people, she has chronicled ephemera, like the paintings of hand-decorated lunchboxes (all very punk) that appeared in “Transpacific Borderlands: The Art of Japanese Diaspora in Lima, Los Angeles, Mexico City and São Paulo,” which took place at L.A.'s Japanese American National Museum in 2017.
In addition to painting, Saldamando has a flourishing tattoo practice, specializing in portrait tattoos — an art form she got into after a friend was looking for someone to do a portrait tattoo of her mother, who had died from cancer. “We were looking online and I was like, ‘I can do this way better,’” she recalls.
She apprenticed for several years at a shop in East L.A. to develop her skills. “I practiced on my poor friends,” she says with a chuckle.
But it is the painted portraiture that serves as the spine of her work. Mainly, individuals on blank backgrounds, divorced from their context, their bodies, not the setting, telling the story.
“I’m just not interested in backgrounds,” she says. “I’ve always just been genetically interested in what people have going on here,” she adds, gesturing at her own face.
“They don’t have to be exceptional persons of color. They don’t have to be organizing. They don’t have to be dead. They don’t have to be a martyr. They can just be relatable.”
Saldamando is prepping for a two-woman show with painter Esther Hernandez that will take place at the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago in the fall. “I’m really excited,” she says. “I remember seeing her work as a teenager — that portrait of her girlfriend with a mohawk and the Virgin Mary on her back, it’s really great.”
But first, she has plenty to do in L.A. As Occidental’s 2019-20 Wanlass Artist in Residence, a 7-year-old residency program that invites a different contemporary artist to campus every year, she must teach, make work and produce a catalog. She’s also putting together a raft of events to accompany her exhibition, including readings and presentations by many of the artists she painted for her show. (Carolina Caycedo, an L.A.-based artist known for her environmental work, will be next year’s resident artist.)
“This is the first time in my life that I feel part of this larger Latinx artist community,” she says. “There is this group of artists embracing queerness and gender nonconformity and staunchly being anti-machismo. ... This is a group I have something in common with.”
And they are the people she likes to paint."

‘This is an era of Latinx stories’: America Ferrera honored at Impact Awards
BY DORANY PINEDA

During the National Hispanic Media Coalition’s 23rd Impact Awards Gala, stars and executives donned their best suits and gowns to recognize those who’ve increased opportunities and representation for the Latinx community in media and entertainment.
Among Friday night’s honorees were America Ferrera, executive producer of “Gentefied”; Isabella Gomez from “One Day at a Time”; “Party of Five” actors Niko Guardado and Elle Paris Legaspi; “Magnum P.I.” star Jay Hernandez; Garcia Cos. founder Dany Garcia; Warner Bros. Chair and Chief Executive Ann Sarnoff; “Riverdale” creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa; Ozzie Areu, CEO and founder of one of the nation’s first Latino-owned film studios; and more.
Ferrera, wearing a yellow cheetah-print dress, was honored with the outstanding series producer award for her work on “Gentefied,” Netflix’s new comedy-drama, and NBC’s “Superstore.” (Earlier in the day, Ferrera, who also stars in “Superstore” and has directed several episodes, announced that she would be leaving the show after its fifth season.)
Accepting her award at the end of the night, Ferrera thanked the trailblazers who opened doors for Latinx actors and creators in a moving speech.
“This is an era of Latinx stories. We are living in an era brought ... by many, many generations of Latino and Latina actors, producers, writers, directors who stayed the course and paved the path,” she said to an audience of about 500 at the Beverly Hilton.
“And sometimes they did it all alone and sometimes they went completely unseen, unrecognized, uncelebrated. And sometimes, they never got to see their visions and their talents meet with opportunities that they deserved.”
She singled out the late actress Lupe Ontiveros, whom she called “one of my own heroes.” When she was 17, Ferrera worked with the “Selena” star on the feature “Real Women Have Curves.”
“When I think about Lupe, I think about what a loss it is for all of us when talent goes untapped,” she continued. As a producer, Ferrera said her drive is to bring opportunities to the Latinx community at what she described as a long-overdue moment of Latinx visibility on screen.
“We are in an era of ‘Gentefied’ and ‘Vida.’ We’re in an era of ‘One Day at a Time’ and ‘Party of Five.’ ... and we are in it together. We are no longer scrambling and competing with one another for a paltry slice of the pie. We are baking and serving up a whole bunch of tres leches.”
Before ending her speech, the “Ugly Betty” actress opened up about having felt “isolated” and “alone” as one of few Latinas in the industry.
The ceremony was hosted by “One Day at a Time” mom Justina Machado and Jacob Vargas, who drew many laughs throughout the night, starting with their introductions as the “stereotypical party fan club presidents.”
But before the ceremony officially kicked off, the hosts welcomed two members of the Tongva nation to honor the land where the event took place.
On stage, many presenters and honorees got personal. They shared their experiences in an overwhelmingly white media and entertainment landscape, expressing gratitude to the people who gave them a chance.
“When I came to this country 12 years ago, Hollywood seemed like an unreachable place,” said Gomez while accepting her outstanding series performance award for her role as Elena, the brilliant queer teenager on “One Day at a Time.” She thanked Norman Lear, the show’s creator, and several others who gave “a little Colombian girl with barely any credits to her name a shot.”
Hernandez, who took home the outstanding television performance award for playing the private investigator on “Magnum P.I.,” walked on stage to accept his honor, leaned into the mic and coughed.
“I just want to apologize because my voice is a little scratchy,” he said clearing his throat. “I’m recovering from the coronavirus.”
He was quick to clarify that his virus wasn’t COVID-19, the strain that broke out in China. “This is COVID-15, which is how many Mexican beers I had at the wrap party a few days ago.”
With this confession out of the way, Hernandez went on to speak about a media landscape that he believes has become “increasingly hostile to people of color,” calling out the racist narratives about Latinos that have come out of the White House.
“They used words like ‘criminal,’ ‘illegal,’ ‘drug runners,’ ‘animals’. ... But at ‘Magnum P.I.’ a remake of an iconic American show, a guy with a ‘z’ in his last name gets to be the hero.”
The audience broke into applause. The “Crazy/Beautiful” actor paused and looked around the star-studded ballroom.
“All of us here in this room collectively provide a counterbalance to the divisive rhetoric that is out there,” he said. “We get to tell the story of who we are.”"

How George Floyd’s death and COVID-19 reshaped my identity as a gay Latinx man
BY FRANK ROJAS

As a gay man of color, I feel that there aren’t a lot of places for me to unpack my queer identity. Being gay was never really discussed while I was growing up closeted in my Mexican American household. And the few times it came up, it was in the context of a joke or just spoken about negatively. Questions including “¿Y la novia?” (Spanish for “And where’s your girlfriend?”) constantly enforced this notion that I could only be seen and valued if I were straight.
However, just as I began to come to terms more with my sexuality this year, understanding who I am became more challenging in the middle of a global pandemic and with worldwide protests taking place in response to the killing of yet another Black man by the police. These health and human-rights conflicts have defined how I’ve gone about understanding myself and meeting other LGBTQ folks, especially during the last four months, when I was confined within the parameters of my bedroom.
Having come out three years ago when I was 22, my life as a queer man is still very new to me. There’s a history and a culture that I was never taught or really exposed to. (I went to Catholic school for 13 years.) I’ve been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and a group of friends to turn to, but they still can’t truly grasp my experiences. I’ve never really felt complete. There was always something missing. Therefore, I sought out community on my own.
That’s how I found the Wall Las Memorias Project, an L.A.-based community health and wellness organization dedicated to serving Latinx LGBTQ populations through advocacy and education.
“It’s very telling of a need for connection,” Victor Guerra-Cardoza, an assistant manager of the organization, told me over the phone this month. “A lot of folks are new to the experience and in understanding themselves and their feelings. There are bars. There is Grindr. There’s other spaces to connect, but when we look at all these intersections of all of our identities, we’re looking at the person as a whole person. Having conversations that not only relate to sexuality but also to Latinx identity is very important. We have to really see each other for everything that we are.”
I first came across this organization in November at a South L.A. HIV-awareness event, which I was covering for my blog at the time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Black and Latino queer men are the most affected by HIV. CDC data from 2017 shows that adult and adolescent Latino gay and bisexual men made up 29% of the 27,000 new HIV diagnoses among gay and bisexual men in the United States and and dependent areas. (And those numbers have increased in recent years.)
After meeting two staff members from the Wall Las Memorias Project, I was encouraged to attend the organization’s support group for Latino gay, bi and queer questioning men. I nervously took them up on the invitation, and for the next few months, I began to attend the organization’s bimonthly meetings in its downtown L.A. office.
We have a solid group of about 15 members, and we now meet online once a week for 90 minutes. With COVID-19, the change from in-person meetings to going fully online has been a process. Instead of jumping into my car and braving the 6 p.m. Thursday traffic on the 110 Freeway, I just have to make sure my laptop is charged before I start the Zoom meeting. During the meetings, we cover everything from toxic masculinity to the stages of coming out and queer representation in media, but ultimately the space is used to share, listen and provide support.
“Given everything that’s going on right now with COVID-19 and the civil unrest that many of our siblings are feeling and are going through, it’s nice to have a little space of time together to really unpack a lot of these feelings and traumas,” Guerra-Cardoza told me. “I think we’re building resiliency with each other.”
In a past meeting, we also reflected on what Pride Month means to us now that we’re social distancing. In a way I felt mixed emotions about the term because I never really felt a sense of belonging to the conversation. While I do believe there should be a sense of pride, I would argue that mainstream outlets project an image of a queer identity that is very white, commercialized and not my own.
However, my understanding of what Pride Month could be has become a little different. The killing of George Floyd at the hands of the police has sparked a bigger conversation that is taking place online and on the streets. Recently I was in West Hollywood with a friend. There were crowds of protesters everywhere.
We wore face masks in support of LGBTQ rights and against racial injustices. For the first time since I’ve been out, I realized that I can no longer live with one foot in and one foot out of the closet."

New database bridges crucial gap between Hollywood and Latinx talent
BY LAURA ZORNOSA

Latinos make up 49% of Los Angeles, 18% of the U.S. population — and 4% of film directors in Hollywood. The new Latinx Directors database wants to change that.
Created by Latinx directors Alberto Belli (“The House of Flowers”), Aurora Guerrero (“13 Reasons Why”), Joel Novoa (“Arrow”) and Diego Velasco (“Orange Is the New Black”), the database currently features 80 Latinx directors sortable by genre, experience, location and more.
“For years, the conversation repeats itself: Latinos and Latinas are one of the most underrepresented ethnicity in front and behind the camera,” reads the website. “The statistics show it, and it is irrefutable. Hollywood’s response continues to be, ‘But there’s a lack of Latinx talent.’”
In response, the directory aims to connect studios and agencies with Latinx directors across all disciplines: film, TV, and commercial filmmakers. It also provides a resource for Latinx creatives to meet one another.
“We want to create a community where members help each other,” Novoa told Deadline on Wednesday. “This database is just the start to that journey. This is a place where we can elevate each other while bringing more inclusivity to our industry during these unprecedented times. Diverse directors are generating great content every day, and it is sad for us to see our industry missing so much of that talent.”
The searchable website includes creatives’ reels, as well as allowing them to self-identify by cultural identity/heritage and gender and sexual identities.
“I’m also committed to making sure our database reflects the diversity within our community of directors,” Guerrero told Deadline. “We are of African and Indigenous descent. We are women, queer, transgender and or U.S.-born and raised. The Latinx community is far from monolithic. This is what I want the industry to feel when they visit our database.”
The database, which is the first of its kind, comes on the heels of increased efforts to represent people of color behind the camera, even as those measures sometimes face backlash. On one hand, the inaugural Latinx TV List, which supports television pilots created by Latinx writers, was unveiled at the end of June.
On the other, when film editor Ri-Karlo Handy reached out on Facebook looking for Black film editors, some white editors responded with claims of “anti-white racism” and “reverse discrimination.” Yet Black and Latinx screenwriters continue to push for change — and better representation — in Hollywood."

As representation debate rages, Latinx creators tell Hollywood: ‘Just open the door’
BY LAURA ZORNOSA

The outrage was instant and loud. And warranted.
No Latinx creatives appeared in any of the major categories when nominations for the 72nd Emmy Awards were announced earlier this week. How is that even possible, people raged, especially given “One Day at a Time’s” tongue-in-cheek laughs, “Vida’s” queer joy and “Los Espookys’” oddball humor?
The erasure of Latinos is not exactly news, though. Over the last five years, 82% of nominees in 19 Primetime Emmy categories were white. A mere 1% were Latino.
As the subsequent backlash to this year’s nominations reignites debate about Hollywood’s failure to represent Latinx characters on-screen, a movement toward inclusion behind the camera is taking place behind the scenes.
One morning in 2015, about 20 Latinas took up every single chair on Gloria Calderón Kellett’s patio — and she had made turkey burgers for everyone.
The Latina TV Writers Brunch Group began that very day at the “One Day at a Time” showrunner’s house, and today it includes about 155 members. Co-founder Judalina Neira is amazed that the group has multiplied fivefold.
“I think that’s such a testament to the explosion of growth and the representation that we’re gaining,” she said recently on a Zoom call. “It’s still not enough, but we’re gaining.”
Neira’s group, which she co-founded with fellow TV writer Diana Mendez, was inspired by Black Women Who Brunch and a similar group for Black men in the industry. In turn, La Lista, the Latina TV Writers Brunch Group’s online talent directory developed by “Mixed-ish’s” Emilia Serrano, inspired the Latinx Directors co-founders who recently launched their own database.
From La Lista to the Latinx Directors database to the inaugural Latinx TV List, the vastly underrepresented community is collaborating throughout Hollywood to bridge Latinx talent with executives and producers — and to foster solidarity among one another.
“Our purpose is really to get us into the rooms where our voices can be heard, where our unique point of views can be heard, where our experiences can be heard,” Mendez told the L.A. Times in the same Zoom interview with Neira. “And keep us in those rooms and keep us moving up the ranks long enough to take ownership of those stories and be in charge of the rooms.”
La Lista answers the question “Where are the Latino/a writers?,” which the duo often hears floating around the industry. The list began as an internal resource to keep the group organized, but soon enough others began to ask for it.
Although the list has led to getting Latina writers in the room where it happens, in front of showrunners, the women still see a trend: Black and brown writers are asked to repeat the same level over and over. That is, they’re barred from climbing the ladder toward becoming showrunners.
At the same time, just 4.7% of screenwriters are Latinx, even though Latinos make up 18.3% of the U.S. population. A solution to that disparity lies in who’s hiring.
“We feel that putting writers of color in positions of authority, and in hiring positions specifically, leads to more people of color being hired regardless of their ethnicity,” Neira said. “When I staff my room, whatever show I have in the future, I will absolutely make sure that there’s a wide spread of representation.”
Neira works as a co-executive producer on the upcoming Netflix show “Girls on the Bus.” Mendez is a co-producer on “The Rookie.” Neither one is interested in perpetuating Latinx stereotypes on-screen. According to a USC Annenberg report, 24% of all Latino characters in the top films of 2017-2018 were depicted as lawbreakers across a range of violent and non-violent crimes.
“The whole reason why I wanted to become a writer was because I was sick of seeing the same cholos, vatos, the maid, and that’s it, as far as Latino characters, Latinos being the criminals,” Mendez said. “There is a very strong activist blood running through the veins of all of our members.”
After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, empathy permeated the group. A sense of solidarity exists among them, they said, and the need to uplift all people of color is “built into [their] DNA.”
While Brunch Group members were protesting in the streets and calling the L.A. City Council, top entertainment companies were declaring their support for diversity and inclusion — again. Alberto Belli, a Latinx Directors database co-founder, isn’t seeing results from studio diversity and inclusion programs.
“They were committed to diversity,” he said. “And then they just released another letter after Black Lives Matter that they’re committed to diversity. And you’re like, wait, weren’t you committed to diversity 10 years ago?”
Belli was selected for the Sony Pictures Television Diverse Directors Program. He’s from Mexico, based in L.A. and comes from a computer-science engineering background — all traits that appear in bright blue when you search his name on the Latinx Directors site.
The database itself comprises an accordion of nine filters, from “cultural identity/heritage” to “self identification,” including gender and sexual identity. Those categories brim with intention: The team scratched “nationality” in favor of chosen cultural identity, and chose “self-identification” to allow directors to showcase their perspectives.
“No more stories about us, without us,” they say. And with good reason: Between 2007 and 2018, only 4% of top films were directed by Latinos. Just one of those directors was Latina.
But co-founder and “Arrow” director Joel Novoa pointed out that, because the L.A. Latinx community spans so many cultural identities, those differences can cause friction at times.
“It’s such a diverse culture that I think that’s one of our strengths, and at the same time, it’s one of our weaknesses,” he said. “Because what can become a strength of all of us being united, at the same time, makes us all work separated.”
But those facets are beginning to draw together. When writer and producer Carolina Paiz, the wife of third Latinx Directors co-founder Diego Velasco, showed him La Lista’s website (she’s a member), the “Orange Is the New Black” TV director was inspired. He took the idea for a related database to Belli and Novoa in April 2019, and Latinx Directors was born.
“Just open the door,” Velasco said. “I’m not asking for anything extra. Just give us a shot and I promise you will not — you won’t realize the spice you didn’t have in your life until you work with us. And let us bring our spice to the work that we’ve done.”
One way to crack that door ajar is through amplification — and tantalizing deals. Hulu, the Black List and an array of partner organizations did just that with the inaugural Latinx TV List, which was announced at the end of June.
Writer and producer Paloma Martinez frantically revised her TV script, checking it for grammar in the passenger’s seat as her mom drove them home from Northern California. Three months after submitting it (and two other pilots), her family gathered around at lunch to hear her announced as a winner.
Martinez’s script, “El Borde,” or “The Edge,” — a story about the environment, mutation and cultural fusion — was one of 10 selected. Beatrice Springborn, Hulu’s vice president of content, reached out to propose that the streaming giant meet with all 10 writers — and offer a script deal to two of them.
“The first word that comes to mind is recognition,” Martinez said. “We’ve been there: We’ve been writing, we’ve been hustling, we’ve been working our way up in the ranks, from assistants up to executives. … Especially being a woman of color, being BIPOC, LGBTQIA, is like when if you’re not what the industry is used to, they tend to want someone to vet you.”
And vet the scripts they did. Latinx writers submitted scripts through the Black List, a screenplay-rating platform, which read them for quality then passed on a select group to the Latin Tracking Board, the National Assn. of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP), Remezcla and the Untitled Latinx Project (ULP) to evaluate.
“Boom,” said Black List founder Franklin Leonard. “Here’s a bunch of great scripts. Not only can the Black List validate their quality, but these other organizations in the Latinx community can vouch for their excitement about this version of representation in the community.”
Among those organizations, the ULP, an offshoot of the Latina TV Writers Brunch Group, reached out to champion latinidad in the industry. Just as the Black List released the first Latinx List for feature screenplays last summer, the ULP hopped on board to partner for the subsequent Latinx TV List.
“Vida” writer and ULP member Lindsey Villarreal wanted to see stories about identity, sure, but she also wanted to see Latinos doing normal stuff usually attributed to white people.
“If you really read the scripts on this list, they’re not falling into these stereotypes,” she said recently over FaceTime from a cabin in Big Sur. “Nobody’s in the cartel, nobody’s doing a drug run, nobody’s crossing the border. It’s all just slice of life stuff, that’s [what] we want to be in those stories that are populating network shows right now.”
Those winning scripts were announced at this year’s NALIP Media Summit. Spearheaded by NALIP President Ben Lopez, the association joined the other judges to score scripts.
“Think of it as like the perfect alliance, United Nations, almost like the Avengers coming together for a very specific subject,” he said. “And here we are; it was successful.”
It was successful, perhaps, because it was deeply intentional. Each of these organizations and groups places intersectionality front and center: NALIP made sure that queer readers read stories about LGBTQ identities, for instance.
And each piece of the Latinx TV and film community centers the Black entertainment community first. Members of the Latina TV Writers Brunch Group look up to Black writers as an example and protested on their behalf in the recent demonstrations. The first category under the Latinx Directors’ “Cultural Identity/Heritage” filter is Afro-Latinx (the second is Indigenous-Latinx). NALIP has been pushing to increase access for Black and Afro-Latinx communities.
“Many folks from our community identify [as] Black first, rather than Latino, or they identify as both,” Lopez said. “And that’s important: to listen to that community, our community.”
The Latinx community in Hollywood is multifaceted, but it shares a common goal: to uplift creatives of color.
“Fundamentally, the goal of the film industry is to make film and television about everybody,” the Black List’s Leonard said. “And if you’re not doing that, you’re failing. So this industry has been failing for as long as it’s existed. And it’s long overdue for us to stop failing on this front.”"

Pew poll finds most Latinos haven’t heard of ‘Latinx.’ Only 3% use the term
BY DANIEL HERNANDEZ

The term “Latinx” has been embraced by 3% of Latinos in the United States, according to the first major poll on the topic by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, which closely tracks “Hispanic/Latino” demographic and social trends. The study, released Tuesday, also found that roughly three out of four Latinos in the U.S. hadn’t even heard of the term.
The Pew findings suggest that Latinx has a significant way to go before it enters fully generalized usage in the United States, despite its enthusiastic embrace at colleges and universities, in liberal corporate discourse, some news media outlets, Hollywood and among recent presidential primary candidates such as Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro.
Among those who had heard of Latinx, 33% said it should be used to describe the Hispanic or Latino population, while 65% said it should not be used. Researchers also found that people in the United States still prefer to self-identify as “Hispanic” (61%) followed by “Latino” (29%) or their country of origin.
Pew interviewed 3,030 U.S. Hispanic or Latino adults, ages 18 to 65 and older, in December 2019. The survey was conducted bilingually and was “nationally representative,” Pew said.
Latinx, which emerged online and in academia in the early 2000s, is the most recent attempt to rectify a perceived long-standing problem in Spanish-rooted words that appear in American English: the gendering of nouns that end in “o” (masculine) or “a” (feminine). Accepting “Latino” as the default term for a mixed-gender group of people reinforces patriarchy, Latinx proponents say, and excludes people who are transgender or gender-nonconforming.
Previously, academics experimented with the textual use of “Latin@” in an attempt to resolve the problem, which was pronounced as “Latino/Latina.” (Latinx is pronounced as “Latin-ex.”) Still others have advocated “Latine” as another gender-neutral alternative.
“Identity terms come and go. Hispanic is from the ’70s, Latino is from the ’90s, and Latinx is a more recent term, and it’s possible that its use could rise,” said Mark Hugo Lopez, one of the authors of the study. “But one thing that is happening worldwide is a growing number of conversations around gender-neutral language, and we see similar movements here.”
Latinx grew in relative popularity only recently. A Google Trends analysis found searches about Latinx rose after the 2016 Pulse shooting in Orlando, Fla., where 49 people were killed in an attack targeting an LGBTQ Latin nightclub. Nonetheless, searches of “Latinx” still trail considerably behind “Latina,” “Latino” and “Hispanic,” Pew found.
Young Hispanics (ages 18-29) were the most likely to have heard of Latinx, at 42%, the study found. Other subsets with more awareness of the term included the college-educated, those who are English-dominant and Democratic or Democratic-leaning respondents. The lowest levels of awareness were found among the Spanish-dominant, those who are foreign-born, respondents who identify as Republicans and those with a high school diploma or less.
In interviews with respondents, Pew found that some felt Latinx is an unnecessary “anglicism” of the Spanish language, or “not representative of the larger Latino community.” Critics point out that there are contradictory exceptions throughout modern Spanish in which masculine or feminine nouns are inverted when paired with their definite articles (“the radio” is “la radio” in Spanish not “el radio,” for example; “the water” is “el agua”).
Awareness of “Latinx” does not necessarily translate to usage, Lopez said. While the youngest Latinos were most likely to be aware of Latinx, only 7% of respondents in that age group actively use it, Pew found.
“So while it’s rising in use, it is still relatively not well known,” Lopez said. “Certainly the Hispanic population is very young. Half the population is under the age of 30, so this is a young population, and it is young people who are most aware of Latinx and are most likely to use it.”"

John Leguizamo wants to eradicate ‘cultural apartheid’ with positive Latinx stories
BY LAURA ZORNOSA

Not many movies have been in the works for 23 years.
When Miami movie producer Carla Berkowitz read about a high school chess team in a 1997 issue of the Miami Herald’s Tropic magazine, she knew she had to snap up the rights to the story.
For more than two decades, Berkowitz kept in touch with five team members — Oelmy “Ito” Paniagua, Gil Luna, Rodelay Medina, Sedrick Roundtree and Marcel Martinez. Then actor and director John Leguizamo stepped in.
“I related to this story of these kids who were in a tough neighborhood and didn’t really fit in,” Leguizamo recently told USA Today. “They didn’t really want to go be gangsters, they didn’t want to play football. They were street intellectuals, bookworms and nerds. And this teacher created this safe space for them.”
The movie, “Critical Thinking,” premiered online on Sept. 4. It tells the true story of five Latinx and Black teenagers — played by Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Jeffrey Batista, Angel Bismark Curiel, William Hochman and Corwin Tuggles — from an underserved Miami neighborhood. Cuban-American teacher Mario Martinez (played by Leguizamo) coaches them to the National Chess Championship. Leguizamo also directed the film.
“Positive Latin stories, feel-good movies,” he told USA Today. “They’ve seen Disney or they’ve seen ‘After School Special.’ They’re tricky, but they’re much appreciated. We need these stories. We gotta have stories of success, of excellence, told by Latin people, about Latin people, for Latin people.”
Two years ago, Leguizamo’s one-man show “Latin History for Morons” made it to Netflix and was staged at L.A.'s Ahmanson Theatre last year. Inspired by his quest to find Latinx heroes for his son, the comedy addressed the “cultural apartheid” of the lack of Latinx visibility in entertainment and media.
“Critical Thinking” has a similar goal in mind.
“We’re the largest ethnic group in America,” Leguizamo said to USA Today. “We’re 25% of the U.S. box office, we’re 30% of the public school population, and our kids don’t see themselves. It’s incredible: It’s like we’re living in a cultural apartheid, like we don’t exist. We’re here, we contribute money, taxes, and yet we’re virtually invisible.”
The New York Times reported Wednesday that, of the 25 people who run the top TV networks and Hollywood studios, just three are Black or Hispanic. “Critical Thinking,” however, featured a predominantly Black and Hispanic cast: Leguizamo was born in Colombia, Lendeborg in the Dominican_Republic; Batista is Cuban, Bismark Curiel is Dominican and Tuggles is Black.
“We share the same story because, like me, he’s Cuban. He came to the U.S. at 17, and I came to the U.S. when I was turning 18,” Batista told the Miami New Times of Marcel Martinez, the man who inspired his character. “For me, doing this movie basically means what for him was to become the national champion in chess. It’s the ultimate dream to be in a movie like this.”"

Latinx arts groups are underfunded. How a new alliance is pushing for equality
BY DEBORAH VANKIN

The opening of the “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA” art exhibitions in fall 2017 was “a night to remember,” said John Echeveste, chief executive of LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, a downtown L.A. cultural center and museum. Thousands of people mingled under the stars on the Getty Center’s vast travertine courtyard, filling the dance floor and noshing on hors d’oeuvres from Puerto_Rico, Brazil, El_Salvador, Argentina and Colombia while celebrating the diversity and vibrancy of Latinx and Latin American arts.
“Just to see that kind of recognition and celebration of our Latinx arts community — the artists, the history — it was really awe-inspiring,” Echeveste said. “It was like: ‘They finally recognized what we’re all about.’”
But when the spotlight faded, “the question was: ‘Where do we go from here?’” said Betty Avila, executive director of Self Help Graphics & Art, a PST participant.
The answer came last month with the formation of the Latinx Arts Alliance, five L.A.-area cultural organizations including LA Plaza and Self Help Graphics who have joined forces to advocate for underrepresented Latinx artists and institutions. The other founding organizations are the Museum of Latin American Art, the Vincent Price Art Museum and the Social and Public Art Resource Center, better known as SPARC.
The timing of the alliance’s debut — during a national reckoning over racial inequality that has sparked an examination of longstanding biases and imbalances in the arts world — is not by accident, said Avila, who serves as the group’s president.
“We’re in the midst of this incredible racial justice movement — coming out now, it will be the reason things get done, that they change,” Avila said.
Latinx Arts Alliance launched with $35,000 in seed money from Bank of America, some of which went to the creation of a website that will cross-promote exhibitions and keep readers up to date on Latinx events across the city.
“What was important for me was the possibility for power building,” Avila said. “Latinx cultural organizations and POC cultural organizations are not the mainstream, not well-funded and systemically undercapitalized; but when we come together, we’re amplifying our voice.”
Addressing inequities facing the Latinx creative community across the culture sphere — particularly pertaining to funding — is a chief concern of the alliance, Avila said.
Philanthropy for Latinx arts organizations across the U.S. has been on the steady decline, with about $14.9 million in grants given to such organizations in 2017, down from $40 million in 2013, according to the most recent data from Hispanics in Philanthropy, an Oakland-based nonprofit. By contrast, overall foundation assets and foundation giving in the U.S., according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, was rising during that period. Despite constituting an estimated 18.5% of the population in the U.S. as of 2019, Latinx communities received only 1% of the country’s total foundation funding between 2013 and 2017, according to LatinxFunders.org, a data project run by HIP and Candid, a data collection and research nonprofit in New York.
“Often your grant is based off of your current budget size, not your impact,” Avila said. “It keeps small organizations small.”
The 47-year-old Self Help Graphics & Art, a community arts center in Boyle Heights that grew out of the 1970s Chicano movement, has a $1-million annual operating budget, but its funding, which comes primarily from grants, donors and earned income, doesn’t reflect its impact in the community, Avila said.
“It didn’t matter that, only five years ago, we had a staff of three people and a $350,000 annual operational budget; we were serving an audience of 25,000 to 30,000 people coming to exhibitions and participating in events and workshops. We’re bigger now, with an administrative staff of six, but we’re still catching up to our output.”
Securing funding for historical exhibitions is particularly challenging, said Echeveste, who describes the 9-year-old LA Plaza as a museum of SoCal area Latinx history, art and culture.
“Historical exhibitions, they’re not as sexy, but it’s part of our mission, and we’re committed to doing that,” Echeveste said. “But it’s hard — we have been chronically underfunded for a long time.”
LA Plaza receives about $1.7 million in county funds toward its $3.5-million annual operating budget. While it has received financial support from local philanthropic organizations, including the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, the Annenberg Foundation and the Keck Foundation, it’s not had success capturing the attention of deep-pocketed arts funding foundations that are farther afield.
“We still have a long way to go to open the doors with some of those larger, national foundations based on the East Coast,” Echeveste said. “The Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, the Warhol Foundation — they have little awareness of us and may have a mistaken perception of who we are and the role that we play. So by telling our story together, we can make a greater impact with those organizations.”
Key issues for the Museum of Latin American Art, said President and Chief Executive Lourdes I. Ramos-Rivas, are equity and visibility. The 24-year-old Long Beach museum is seeing increased media attention and donations this month, she said, because it is Hispanic Heritage Month; but that should be the norm, not a siloed response to an annual event, she said.
“The door is open in many different ways because there’s a celebration attached to it,” Ramos-Rivas said. “But instead of stereotyping or working within a specific time frame, we’re looking for support on a more permanent basis. We have to really work on this transition, where it’s not an exception to be a sponsor or give support to a Latinx art organization.”
Even the citywide excitement over 2017’s PST — for which the museum staged “Relational Undercurrents: Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago” — was fleeting, Ramos-Rivas said.
“At that moment we were relevant,” she said. “It emphasized Latinx and Latin American culture for a specific period of time in museums. But that’s not gonna happen with the next PST [in 2024]. They did not take our proposals this time. Is the Latinx art experience represented across the board or just waiting for that special moment?”
The Getty said it’s still early in the planning process for PST and there will be additional opportunities, over the next four years, for organizations to participate; it said it hopes to work with MOLAA in the upcoming “Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A.”
Public art is a unique challenge said Carlos Rogel, executive director of the 44-year-old Venice-based SPARC, which produces, preserves and presents public art and activist art around L.A. County as well as stages exhibitions.
“It’s regularly conflated with community service programs or children’s painting programs and not fine art commissions,” Rogel said.
That identity struggle is compounded when granting gatekeepers have preconceived notions of the often low-income neighborhoods that SPARC serves, Rogel said, citing South L.A. and Pacoima as examples.
“When we face resistance from public and private funding sources to investing in new commissions or advocating for maintenance and conservation of these works, some of what comes up is, ‘Oh, it will just get damaged or destroyed a few months later,’ as if it’s not going to be taken care of by these communities. It’s almost like the idea of placing fine art in low-income neighborhoods and communities is an incongruous idea.”
A goal with the alliance, Rogel said, is to have conversations with policy makers about funding for community-based arts organizations and “for the audience that follows us at the alliance to better understand these challenges we face, individually and collectively.”
The scale and diversity of L.A.’s cultural scene can seem daunting to a small museum located on a college campus, even one doing ambitious, culturally-relevant programming. The Vincent Price Art Museum, which is part of East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, is hoping the alliance will boost awareness of its very existence, said Vincent Price Art Museum Foundation board member Norma Fabian Newton.
“L.A. is very big and has so many amazing dynamic cultural institutions, but sometimes it can be a little easy to get lost,” Fabian Newton said. “Our main hope as a member of the alliance is that it will act as a springboard to really help elevate the work.”
Vincent Price receives funding from the college and has held exhibitions in partnership with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and its foundation has made joint acquisitions with LACMA. But being situated on a college campus also comes with unique challenges, Fabian Newton said. The campus — and museum — will be closed because of COVID-19 at least through the spring 2021 term.
“So while other organizations may open their doors and use other mechanisms, like timed visits, to continue to be in dialogue with their communities and to continue to showcase the work, we won’t be able to do that,” Fabian Newton said. “How do we continue to bring awareness to the type of work we’re doing, which is also work around inclusion and equity in the art world? The communications and press that the alliance can help bring is critical.”
The Latinx Arts Alliance is brainstorming ideas for collaborative exhibitions and programming. It’s receiving new member requests and will start developing the membership program next year.
“As soon as we launched, folks were like, ‘Sign me up.’ The enthusiasm was exciting,” Avila said. “But in some ways, it’s good to start small and scale up so that it is sustainable.”"

George Lopez, Rita Moreno join CBS’ star-studded special celebrating Latinx culture
BY CHRISTI CARRAS

Just in time for National Hispanic Heritage Month, CBS has unveiled a star-studded lineup for its forthcoming special “Essential Heroes: A Momento Latino Event.”
On Wednesday, the network announced that George Lopez, Rita Moreno, John Leguizamo and more celebrities have joined the telecast celebrating Latinx culture and recognizing the contributions of the Latinx community during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hosted by Eva Longoria, Gloria Estefan and Ricky Martin, “Essential Heroes: A Momento Latino Event” airs Oct. 26 at 9 p.m. Pacific on CBS and will also be available to stream on demand at CBS All Access. The hourlong program promises to amplify Latinx voices through musical performances, comedy sets, documentary shorts and more.
“When COVID-19 hit the United States, people were quick to applaud our essential workers, many of whom are Latinos, for helping to keep food on our tables, delivering our packages and working in our healthcare system,” Longoria said in a statement.
“The Latinx community has been the backbone of this country for hundreds of years, not just the last seven months, and it’s time that we not only know our own worth, but are also recognized, appreciated and celebrated accordingly for our contributions, pandemic or not.”
Created by Henry R. Muñoz III and directed by Ron de Moraes, “Essential Heroes: A Momento Latino Event” will also feature appearances from José Andrés, Arturo Castro, Isabela Merced, Ana Navarro, Freddy Rodriguez and Wilmer Valderrama.
The broadcast is produced by Momento Latino, Funny or Die, UnbeliEVAble Entertainment and Global Philanthropy. Longoria is also an executive producer, and more performers are expected to be announced at a later date.
“We created Momento Latino because we understand the challenges that Latinos in America face every day, and we knew we had to bring together a national infrastructure of opportunity to move the community forward into the future,” said Muñoz, founder of Momento Latino, in a statement.
“Through this special we can share with the nation the inspiring stories of how Latinos served as the backbone of this country’s essential workforce throughout the pandemic despite being among the hardest hit by the disease and the economic fallout.”"

‘We are tired’: Read the open letter 270 fed-up Latinx writers just sent Hollywood
BY GREG BRAXTON

Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Leguizamo and “One Day at a Time” co-creator Gloria Gloria Calderón Kellett are among 270 showrunners, creators, television and film writers who are calling for systemic change in the entertainment industry in regard to Latinx artists.
The group of writers and producers outlined their concerns in an open letter to Hollywood written in conjunction with Hispanic Heritage Month, which ends today. “We are tired,” they write.
In the letter, the signatories contend that “Hollywood power brokers are complicit in our exclusion,” noting that just 4.7% of feature writers and 8.7% of TV writers are Latinx, despite making up 18.3% of the U.S. population overall. Among the five demands laid out in the letter, the writers note the importance of hiring more Latinx talent, including in in decision-making roles like creator/showrunner: “No stories about us without us.”
The letter is part of an initiative started by the Untitled Latinx Project (ULP), an all-Latina advocacy group founded by Tanya Saracho, showrunner of the Starz drama “Vida,” to increase representation of Latinx-created stories for television.
Read the full letter below.
Dear Hollywood,
As we come to the end of Hispanic Heritage Month in the midst of a global pandemic and continued racial injustice, many of us in the Latinx community have found it difficult to celebrate. Inspired by the activism of the Black and Indigenous communities, many of whom also identify as Latinx, we stand in solidarity with our fellow Black, Native and Indigenous writers, co-signing their WGAW Open Letters and echoing their demands for systemic change in our industry.
As Latinx Showrunners, Creators, TV and Feature Writers, we are incensed by the continued lack of Latinx representation in our industry, especially among the Black and Indigenous members of our community. Our stories are important, and our erasure onscreen contributes to the persistent prejudice that prevents real change in this country. This prejudice is not as overt as the one that keeps immigrant children in cages and separates families at the border, or as violent as the racism that is killing our Black, Brown, and Indigenous community members at the hands of police. But when we are onscreen, we’re often relegated to stereotypes or villains. And as a recent New York Times OpEd states, “White elites cannot muffle a huge, vibrant community for decades and not expect consequences. For Latinos in the Trump era, these consequences are deadly, from Hurricane Maria to the Walmart shooting in El Paso and the pandemic, as well as soaring hate crimes.”
Writers create television and films, the arenas where national conversations about culture take place. But while Latinx are 18.3% of the U.S. population, we only make up 4.7% of feature writers and 8.7% of TV writers. As Latinx writers move up to Showrunner level, the stats only get more dismal.
By refusing to tell our stories AND by refusing to put us in charge of telling them -- Hollywood power brokers are complicit in our exclusion.
We are tired of Latinx projects being developed with no Latinx writer, director, or producer attached. We refuse to be filtered through a White perspective.
We are tired of hearing “we couldn’t find any Latinx writers to hire.”
We are tired of Latinx writers being asked to repeat Staff Writer and lower staffing levels, which not only ensures that we stay at those levels, but also helps perpetuate the narrative that Latinx writers don’t exist at the Showrunner and other upper levels.
We are tired of being painted with the same brush. We are made up of an array of backgrounds and ethnicities.
We are tired of stories that are only about our trauma. We contain multitudes.
We are tired.
Movement on this is critical. Inclusivity is not enough. We want action. Here are our demands:
1. No Stories About Us Without Us
Make room for us to tell our own stories. It is not enough to hire one Latinx writer and expect them to be the sole representative of a vast and heterogeneous group of people. Hire more of us. Listen to us. Put us in positions of power. Don’t know how to find us? Reach out to the WGA, or go to one of the TV writer lists created by members of our community. (La Lista, The Latinx Writers, Afro-Latinx List)
If you’re a non-Latinx White writer and are offered a Latinx-centered project with no Latinx writer, director or producer at the helm, consider partnering up with someone who is, or even passing it on to and advocating for a Latinx writer. While we recognize that writers can tell stories about an array of voices and experiences, until the Latinx community is close to reaching parity, we need to be included in the telling of our own stories.
2. Greenlight Our Projects
Make a plan to reach demographic parity. It is not enough to buy our pilots, you must also greenlight them. Only a handful of pilots by Latinx writers are bought each year, and most of those are never made. Likewise, if studios, networks, and production companies were more intentional about hiring BIPOC executives, more of our stories would be championed to production. And with the recent commercial and critical success of Pose, One Day At A Time, Vida, and Gentefied, it’s clear Latinx stories find loyal audiences and receive accolades.
3. Represent All Aspects Of Our Lives And Culture
Make sure the projects you greenlight reflect the diversity of our population. We are a diaspora from more than 20 different countries. We are more than just White Latinx and Mestizxs. We are Black and Indigenous. We are LGBTQIA. We are Undocumented. We are Disabled. We have different religious backgrounds and spiritual beliefs. We are more than our trauma. We write stories of joy, origin stories, genre stories, children’s stories, and much more. We demand to be seen and heard in our entirety.
4. Do Away With Repeating Levels
In television writing, we want advancement of all writers and regular promotions like our non-Latinx White counterparts. For too long, BIPOC writers have had to remain at Staff Writer level for multiple years, either because they are dismissed as “diversity hires” or due to the loopholes that Diversity and Inclusion Programs have unintentionally helped foster. Our talent is wasted for years at the lower ranks, keeping us from Showrunner positions. Rather than hold us back, invest in our growth.
5. Hire Us For Non-Latinx Projects
We are able to write more than identity stories. In fact, our stories are also American stories, stories of resilience, of liberation, of hope. Stories of business owners chasing the American dream, little girls that one day will be president or work for NASA, war veterans, nurses, musical artists and fashionistas.
Because we are steeped in the dominant culture, we speak at least two, if not more, cultural languages, well versed in yours as much as we are in ours. Our voices and our perspective will undoubtedly enhance yours and that of all Americans.
We submit this open letter in good faith that you, as our peers and colleagues, will consider it, likewise. And we will continue to demand an industry that sees us, hears us, and values our contributions so that the world will do the same through the stories we tell.
Stories are powerful. Stories change the world. Let’s get on the right side of history so we can continue to create needed change and tell captivating stories together."

The man behind ‘Selena: The Series’ is ready to lead Hollywood’s Latinx revolution
BY YVONNE VILLARREAL

Producer Jaime Dávila knows expectations are high for “Selena: The Series,” the upcoming biographical saga about beloved Tejana star Selena Quintanilla. Set to make its debut on Netflix in December, two years after it was announced, the TV drama is one of the season’s most anticipated releases — and it’s one of the few series this year featuring a Latinx cast at a time when calls for more Latinx representation are growing louder.
“We know how big of a deal this show is,” Dávila, 35, says by video conference from his home in midcity Los Angeles.
As the president and co-founder of Campanario Entertainment, the L.A.-based production company behind the series, Dávila has been on a mission to get Hollywood’s gatekeepers to abandon their outdated perceptions of the Latinx market.
“So much of what often happens in these rooms in Hollywood is that people will divide us,” he says. “They’ll say, ‘Oh, Latino — that’s a separate category.’ What I keep trying to say and what Campanario keeps trying to say with everything we do is that we’re not a separate category. We’re part of America. We’re part of the mainstream.”
For nearly seven years, Dávila and the Campanario team — a mighty six-person crew — have been working behind the scenes, developing content for major Hollywood players like Netflix, Amazon and Bravo, in an effort to bolster Latinx representation on screen, one project at a time, in the U.S. and abroad.
And with “Selena: The Series,” perhaps the company’s highest-profile project to date, the hope is to achieve the sort of mainstream success that will open more doors for content about, and made by, Latinos in an industry that remains overwhelmingly white despite pledges for greater diversity and inclusion.
“I’d really describe ‘Selena: The Series’ as a culmination of the work that we have put in to build a company that could highlight these types of themes, these types of stories, and bring it to a mainstream market,” Dávila says. “More than anything, we’re trying to show Hollywood that there’s this huge market of Latinx/Latino people; that our stories are American stories; that our stories are global stories. Being able to point to a story like ‘Selena: The Series,’ which is all of those things, is really great. I would love for more doors to open up.”
In addition to “Selena: The Series,” the company has produced multilingual content in the U.S. and Mexico, including Bravo’s short-lived “Mexican Dynasties,” the immigration documentary “Colossus,” “Camelia la Texana” for Telemundo and Netflix, as well as the dramedy “Como Sobrevivir Soltero,” one of the first Amazon original series to launch for Amazon Prime Video Mexico.
“They have a real eye on what all the Latin American territories have to offer, talent-wise,” says Javiera Balmaceda, Amazon Studios’ head of international originals in Argentina, Chile and Colombia.
Francisco Ramos, Netflix’s vice president of Spanish-language originals in Latin America, echoes the sentiment: “They have a deep understanding of these stories because they see themselves in the characters, they see themselves in the people they hire behind the camera.”
Campanario‘s efforts, particularly in the U.S., come at a time when Latino inclusion in Hollywood remains abysmal. Despite Latinos making up nearly 18% of the U.S. population, they are severely underrepresented in key roles across the industry, according to the latest UCLA Hollywood Diversity report. The study found that only 6.6% of broadcast TV leads were played by Latinx actors; they also played 5.5% of cable’s lead roles and 4.0% of digital‘s in the 2018–19 season. On the film side, Latinos held 4.6% of movie acting roles in 2019. And Latinos had just 2.8% of the writing credits and 2.7% of the directing credits of last year’s 145 top-grossing films.
Dávila is determined to be part of Hollywood’s revolution. He recently joined the board of directors of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and is, perhaps surprisingly, more optimistic than cynical about the entertainment industry’s capacity to change. He’s not alone in the fight: a recent open letter demanding better representation in Hollywood was signed by more than 270 Latinx TV creators — including “Vida’s” Tanya Saracho, “One Day at a Time’s” Gloria Calderon Kellett, and Lin-Manuel Miranda — and politicians like L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) have also joined the effort.
“When ‘Selena: The Series’ works all over the world, I’m not going to be surprised,” Dávila says. “I’m so positive about our future because I know our community is brimming with ideas and wanting to do it. Yes, is it slow, I’m not going to disagree with that, but I just think that as a producer, as Campanario, as a production company, we are excited by the level of talent that we see in our community.”
Born in the border town of McAllen, Texas, before moving to New York at 10, Dávila is the son of Mexican immigrants. His father, Jaime Dávila, Sr., was a former president of Univision and executive at Televisa; his mother, Pilar, was a stay-at-home parent who Dávila credits with taking on the role as the head of the family while his father commuted between the U.S. and Mexico.
“I grew up with ratings coming in on the fax machine on the daily and helping my dad find the ratings, highlight them and sort of try to figure out what was working or what wasn’t right,” he says. “Why is this novela working? Why is this one not working? Why is this actor in this role, maybe not work?” (Dávila, Sr. now serves as chairman of Campanario Entertainment.)
Much like his early years in McAllen, often traveling to and from Mexico with his family, Dávila’s TV interests crossed the border. He eagerly waited for new episodes of “Agujetas de color de rosa,” a Mexican telenovela from Televisa, just as he would for “Seinfeld” or “The Real World.”
“I did have the benefit of seeing amazing Latino stars speaking Spanish [in telenovelas],” he says. “Novelas were still really messed up ... but you would at least see a Latino doctor, you would at least see a Latino hero. But I was very cognizant that in American TV, mainstream TV — whatever that means — you weren’t seeing my community and my culture and I felt the effects of that.”
Despite his love for TV and his father’s ties to it, Dávila didn’t initially envision a future for himself within its ranks. He studied anthropology at Harvard and received a master’s degree in Latin American Studies from Oxford. But he eventually leaned into his passion for visual stories.
Early in his career, he worked at ICM, a Hollywood agency, and ITV Studios, before moving to Bravo , where he rose from assistant to development executive under Andy Cohen.
In addition to helping adapt international formats and develop original series at Bravo, including “Vanderpump Rules,” “Below Deck” and “Shahs of Sunset,” Dávila was committed to finding opportunities to showcase Latinx stories on the network. He developed a number of series in that vein: one was a reality show that revolved around Mexican actor Jaime Camil, who had a massive following in his home country, but hadn’t yet broken out in the U.S. (Camil would later charm audiences for five seasons as Rogelio de la Vega on The CW’s “Jane the Virgin.”) Another series would follow the lives of a group of actors from some of Telemundo’s telenovelas. Ultimately, none made it to air.
He’d land his chance a few years after leaving the network, with 2019’s""Mexican Dynasties,” a reality series that followed the lives of rich families in Mexico City. Produced by Campanario, the series lasted one season, but Dávila still considers it a success: “What I learned from ‘Mexican Dynasties’ is don’t stop trying. It had a loyal audience. Rihanna loved it! TV Guide called it the best Bravo show in years.”
Eli Lehrer, Bravo’s former head of development who worked closely with Dávila, described Dávila’s dedication to inclusivity as “invaluable.”
“He was always pushing the brand to expand our horizons and diversify the voices we were bringing to the channel, in particular Latinx representation,” says Lehrer, now the executive vice president of programming at History Channel. “I have been trying to re-hire Jaime as an executive ever since I left Bravo ... but I’m not at all surprised that he is on this path. He really is driven by this mission. He feels strongly that what he’s doing is good business and very important work. He’s chasing this holy grail of a show that will broaden people’s understanding of what Latinx culture is and is also deeply entertaining. He wants to do both. He wants to have that massive hit that speaks to everyone but also does shift people’s understanding of what Latinx characters on TV can look like.”
Will delving into the story of Selena Quintanilla for the small screen help the shift?
The Netflix drama arrives nearly 23 years after the Oscar-nominated film, starring Jennifer Lopez, chronicled the making of the Mexican American singer’s music career, which bridged the gap between her Mexican heritage and South Texas roots. The Gregory Nava-directed film, which offered a rare portrait of a hard-working Latino American family, helped solidify Quintanilla’s place in the culture after her death at age 23.
In the series, which the Quintanilla family developed and executive produced, “The Walking Dead’s” Christian Serratos will play the beloved Queen of Tejano music.
“We’re not going to deny that the movie has a special place in everyone’s hearts,” says Rico Martinez, head of content and digital at Campanario, who worked day-to-day on the series. “It evokes an emotion that is hard to describe. And it will always have that emotional pull with audiences. We will never touch that. We will never take away from that. When you’re doing two seasons’ worth of 18 episodes, it’s going to be a different story. We’re trying to tell this complete story from her birth until the end, and that involves everything that the family did to help Selena get there — because their stories, the story as they told us, isn’t just the story of Selena. It’s the story of their family. So, we’re telling the complete story of the entire band and viewpoints that we’ve never seen before.”
“We’re just showing you so much more,” adds Dávila, whose favorite song by the late singer is “Fotos Y Recuerdos.” “We’re showing you ‘80s Quintanilla family, ‘80s Selena. You’re seeing the behind-the-scenes making of a lot of the songs and how they got created and what went into them. I think so many people, even superfans, don’t know a lot about how the legend happened.”
And getting to tell that story on a global stage is a win.
“One of the most amazing things about being able to go on Netflix,” Dávila says, “is that people in Japan are going to watch the story right away. People in Denmark are going to watch this story right away. And my goal is for people to see our stories in those countries and relate to them and to see themselves in these characters. And I know it’s possible, because I grew up only watching white people and related to that.”"

Why we chose the name Latinx Files for our new newsletter
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

It’s not lost on me that choosing to have “Latinx” in the name of The Times’ new newsletter might rub some people the wrong way. So why call it the Latinx Files?
For me, the use of the term is personal and comes from talking with members of our community who have felt marginalized by other terms used to identify us. It came from talking with friends and colleagues who identify as such, from talking to those who want to make others feel like they belong.
One of these conversations helped crystallize for me why the terms we use are critical to acceptance and understanding.
In June 2019, I interviewed members of Pasión 1927, a Los Angeles-based fan group of Mexico’s national soccer team, on why they had made it their policy to ban a popular homophobic chant associated with the team. José Salsedo, one of the group’s leaders, admitted that he previously used the chant and would defend it by claiming that it wasn’t intended to be homophobic.
“The day I had a conversation with someone from the LGBT community, and they explained to me how [the chant] made them feel, how they feel offended, that’s when I changed my point of view,” he told me.
“That’s when I told myself I was ignorant and I needed to educate myself.”
Salsedo realized that, by using the chant, he was inadvertently telling LGBTQ soccer fans that they weren’t welcome, which is the opposite of Pasión 1927’s mission of uniting El Tri fans across Southern California.
That same reasoning is behind why I chose to use “Latinx.” When I say that I want this newsletter to be a space for everyone, I mean everyone. That includes people who don’t identify as male or female, who don’t see gender as binary.
It’s not a coincidence that the word “Latinx” gained popularity after the 2016 Pulse mass shooting, where 49 people were killed at the LGBTQ nightclub. Many of those killed were Latinx — the shooter opened fire on Pulse’s “Latin Night.”
I’m not saying that you’re homophobic if you don’t use the word “Latinx.”
I’m not saying that it’s what you should call yourself or that it should replace “Hispanic” or “Latina” or, in my case, “Tejano.”
I don’t even care if you use it.
I have heard and read many of the criticisms of the term, and I understand them. I don’t agree with them, but I get the points that opponents of the term make. (If you would like to read op-eds against the term, here is one of the early viral pieces against “Latinx,” and here’s one published in the Los Angeles Times.)
What I am saying is that there are indeed members of our community for whom the “x” helps them feel like they belong.
None of the terms used to describe our community exclude me, but some of them do exclude others. “Latinx,” to me, is the one term that includes everyone.
I also realize that “Latinx” is not as widely used within our community when compared with terms like “Hispanic” and “Latino/Latina,” according to a recently published report by Pew Hispanic Trends. (But you probably already knew that, or at least were able to guess as much given that I’m writing this in the first place.)
But here’s the thing: Language is ever-evolving. This is true for how we as a community have described ourselves and how this news organization’s style guide has changed over time.
Take “Hispanic.” According to that Pew study, 61% of those surveyed said they preferred that word to describe the larger community — only 29% went with “Latino/Latina.” Given those numbers, you would think the term has been around forever. It hasn’t. Its rise in popularity dates to 1975, and it didn’t always enjoy the same broad acceptance it does today. In 1983, only 14% of Californians with Latin American ancestry polled by The Times said that it was their preferred term for self-identification.
Despite the seeming current popularity of “Hispanic,” the Los Angeles Times style guide gives preference to “Latino,” thanks in large part to the late, great Frank del Olmo, the first Latino (that’s what he preferred) to be listed on the newspaper’s masthead.
And as far as I know, that will remain The Times’ policy — except in this space.
Which brings me to how I’m planning on using “Latinx.” You will only see it in the newsletter when it’s me writing. It won’t be in quotes unless the person who provided the statement actually used it, nor will I use it to replace “Hispanic” or “Latino” in proper nouns — the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will not become the Congressional Latinx Caucus, nor will “Latino USA” become “Latinx USA.”
To me, the term “Latinx” is also a nod to what’s to come, of where we’re going.
In 2016, nearly six in 10 Latinxs were millennials or younger, and nearly a third were under the age of 18. Our community is younger than the white, Black and Asian American communities, and although a sizable portion of us eschew the term, it’s the youngest among us who are most likely to use it.
“Latinx is futuristic because it subverts the Spanish language by erasing the gender binary,” G. Cristina Mora, who teaches sociology at UC Berkeley, told the New Yorker in September.
Mora is the author of “Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American,” which is a deep exploration into how people from 20 different countries, of varied races and backgrounds, came to be seen as one community.
“As far as I know, we are the only ethno-racial group where this kind of discussion over labeling is going on.”
This newsletter is more than just a name. The goal of the Latinx Files is to get our stories on the record, to chronicle a future that truly is Latinx while still holding on to where we came from."

Is this housing policy discriminatory?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Hello and welcome to the Latinx Files. I’m Fidel Martinez, and it’s Thursday, Nov. 19. Here is what you need to know this week. (Is this your first Latinx Files newsletter? Have questions about the name? We have an explainer for that.)
“I’m like, ‘What the hell is crime-free?’ And they’re like, ‘If you have a criminal background, we can’t rent to you.’”
Finding housing in California can be difficult. It can be nearly impossible if you’ve had past run-ins with the law.
Take the case of Domingo Nuñez, who was released from jail three years ago and has since found a job that pays him enough to be able to afford a place for himself, his partner and three children. But money wasn’t an issue when it came to searching for a home in the Inland Empire communities of Hesperia, Adelanto and surrounding cities.
It was crime-free housing policies.
“When you get to these places they’re like, ‘Crime-free, crime-free, crime-free,’” Nuñez told The Times. “I’m like, ‘What the hell is crime-free?’ And they’re like, ‘If you have a criminal background, we can’t rent to you.’”
That’s pretty much the gist of what crime-free housing is all about — it’s a collection of policies found in thousands of cities nationwide ostensibly implemented to reduce crime by making it easier for landlords to reject new applicants or evict current tenants that have had brushes with police.
But a new investigation by my colleagues Liam Dillon, Ben Poston and Julia Barajas found that cities had inaccurately used the specter of rising crime rates as a justification for the policies, when in many cases crime was stable or falling when they were passed.
What they found instead was that when Black and Latinx people moved to the suburbs in search of safer neighborhoods and cheaper housing, crime-free housing policies often followed after them.
What’s particularly troubling is the less than thinly veiled language used by politicians to justify passing crime-free housing laws.
One Hesperia councilman said in 2015 that they were hoping “to correct a demographical problem with people that are committing crimes in this community.”
Another one, Bill Holland, likened the city ordinance to how “you would call an exterminator to kill roaches.”
The crime-free housing law passed in 2015. In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Hesperia, alleging that the city had discriminated against Black and Latinx residents through wrongful evictions.
That case is still pending, but even if Hesperia repeals their crime-free housing ordinance, it may not matter. Neighboring Adelanto rescinded a similar law in January, but the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is still conducting voluntary crime-free housing training for landlords.
Hesperia also contracts its policing to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.
OK, so why should you care if you don’t live there?
Because crime-free housing programs have been adopted by nearly 2,000 cities in 48 states, according to the International Crime Free Assn., a nonprofit started in 1992 by a Mesa, Ariz., police officer that offers crime-free housing training to local police and landlords. A version of their manual is used by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and many other police departments across California.
And similar dog-whistle language used by the Hesperia politicians can be found in that document. The most glaring example compares a would-be criminal to a “two-legged urban predator.”
The outsize influence of the International Crime Free Assn. has been found in cities in Minnesota where there’s been a rise in the Somali population. It’s been found in places like Kansas City, Mo., and the Illinois municipalities of DeKalb and Granite City — the latter was sued over claims of discrimination.
Domingo Nuñez eventually found a place to live — a duplex in Adelanto. The place has mold and bedbugs, and the septic tank overflows periodically.
“There has to be something else,” Nuñez told my colleagues.
“My kids deserve more. These little ones with special needs. They deserve a better place, and I can’t give them a better place.”"

Op-Ed: The relationship between Latinos and ‘Latinx’? It’s complicated
BY BENJAMIN FRANCIS-FALLON

When asked how Democrats might translate their success among Arizona’s Latinx community in the latest presidential election, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) tweeted a sharp reply: “First start by not using the term Latinx.”
Though presented as a personal objection, the representative’s remarks have broader significance. The insertion of “Latinx” into the election’s postmortem ritual is the latest iteration of a decades-long battle over names, one that raises questions at the heart of the very idea of a nationwide “Latino vote”: Who belongs to this political community, what are “Latino issues,” and who should be Latinos’ allies?
“Latinx” is of recent vintage, emerging from academia in the 2000s and gaining mainstream usage after the mass shootings at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.; many of those killed were Latinx. It signals inclusion of individuals who do not identify as male or female, who don’t see gender as binary, inscribed in a Spanish language of gendered nouns (such as Latino/Latina). It has particularly resonated with younger people and those in the LGBTQ community.
Critics on the left and right took note during the Democratic primaries when Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign adopted “Latinx” for its Latino outreach. Its use reinforced Warren’s progressive credentials, but detractors cited polls showing that the term is not widely embraced by the constituency it claims to represent.
An August Pew Research Center poll found that only 3% of Latino adults use the label “Latinx,” though almost 15% of Hispanic women ages 18 to 29 do. Many of those who avoid it consider “Latinx” an elitist and outsider identifier. As Gallego put it postelection, the use of “Latinx” symbolizes an attempt to take “away some of my culture” and reorient it toward someone else’s “perspective.” The implication is that politicians who use “Latinx” are yielding to external sensibilities rather than respecting the preferences of their constituencies. Candidates who speak of “Latinx” voters could damage their standing with the country’s largest minority group, according to some political analysts.
The search for a name that is inclusive enough to capture Latinos’ tremendous diversity — across national origin, language, skin color, region, religion, sexuality and gender identity — has long been at the center of the group’s struggle to wield power in this country.
Since a nationwide “Latino vote” first appeared, nomenclature has been a crucial point of debate. After helping John F. Kennedy win the presidency in 1960, Mexican Americans tried to convert their “Viva Kennedy” clubs into a permanent alliance spanning the Southwest. Yet at a 1961 meeting in Phoenix, they could not advance beyond the question of what to call themselves. Having adopted terms reflecting their distinct communities, self-described “Mexican Americans” from California clashed with a contingent of Texas’ “Latin Americans,” while others insisted upon the term “Spanish-speaking.” Some rejected ethnic labels altogether, preferring to emphasize their Americanism.
Like “Latinx,” these labels were seen as both cultural and political identifiers. For example, to call oneself “Mexican American” was, in the early 1960s, to assert ancestral pride against a racist society, similar to African Americans’ embrace of the term “Black” and rejection of “Negro.”
“Mexican American” was widely accepted by leaders in the community by the mid-1960s. Yet the younger generation soon began calling themselves “Chicanos,” a term that stressed their Mexican and Indigenous roots and indicated solidarity with workers, immigrants and the poor. Many of their elders strenuously disapproved.
As Puerto_Ricans and Cubans entered the political arena in greater numbers, some demanded inclusion alongside Mexican Americans in political parties and government programs. By the late 1960s, U.S. Rep. Edward Roybal, a Los Angeles Democrat and Mexican American, saw an opportunity to unite them in an electorate that would stretch from coast to coast. But first they needed an overarching name.
In Washington, Roybal helped propose terms the government could use to try to bring these constituencies under the same umbrella. They included “Spanish-speaking,” “Spanish American,” “Spanish-surnamed” and “Hispanic.” Some labels met strong resistance for alleged inauthenticity. Like “Latinx” today, “Hispanic” was controversial. Some Mexican American political leaders feared that “Hispanic” would obscure the specific problems of Mexican Americans by lumping their communities in with those they had little in common with.
Yet “Hispanic” became widely accepted after it was adopted by the media, used in political discourse and stamped on countless government forms from the late 1970s on.
Those presently objecting to the use of “Latinx” should consider that the meanings and use of such labels in the political arena have changed considerably over time. In 1964, Republicans formed a “Latinos con Goldwater” committee to support the conservative senator in his presidential campaign. Yet by the 1970s, the term “Latino” had migrated leftward, with Democrats forming a “Latino Caucus” within their party in 1972. When the GOP created a “Republican National Hispanic Assembly” two years later, they had come to see “Hispanic” as the more conservative identifier. Within a few more years, there were the “Hispanic American Democrats.” In the latest presidential elections, Latinos for Trump posters were omnipresent in Cuban parts of Miami.
Given this history of shifts, it can be expected that the use and meaning of “Latinx” will evolve, and along with it the discomfort that some have with the term.
There is another lesson to learn from Roybal, who was deeply mindful that labels mattered and thought that national identities would continue to be important to the communities he sought to unite. He was flexible. He knew that different times and situations called for different terms. At a time when many saw “Hispanic” and “Latino” as reflecting different political orientations, Roybal pushed for the acceptance of both. Constructing a pan-Latino political community was about coalition-building above all. Latinos did not have the luxury of ostracizing one another.
Despite its relative novelty, “Latinx” has taken its place in the long struggle over Latino identity in the United States. Instead of trying to eliminate its use — which was once attempted with the now-favored “Hispanic” — resisters should agree that one term could never encapsulate the vast array of ambitions and identities of the country’s largest minority group. Their diverse policies and political agendas should take center stage, however they define themselves."

Letters to the Editor: ‘Latinx’ sounds inauthentic, but let’s talk about what we call ourselves
By Luis Torres, Pasadena

To the editor: Thank you for Benjamin Francis-Fallon’s op-ed article on the emergence of the word “Latinx” to identify those of us who have roots in Spanish-speaking countries. While I am skeptical of the “Latinx,” I believe Francis-Fallon’s article is important because it contributes to the discussion about “what we call ourselves” and, inevitably, what others call us.
I was born during the Eisenhower administration. In elementary school I was Mexican. In high school I was Mexican American (without the hyphen).
As an undergraduate in college I became a Chicano. It was a conscious choice, a decision that evoked my history, progressive political persuasion and the artistic-cultural milieu that I embraced. The main point is that I chose what to call myself.
When I was a graduate student in an Ivy League school, we suddenly became “Latino.”
In the last several years they’ve tried to describe us, variously, as Spanish-speaking (although some aren’t), Hispanic, Latino, “Latin@"" (I’m not kidding) and now “Latinx.” I suppose we do need an all-inclusive term to include Tejanos, Puerto_Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans and the occasional Spaniard, but I’m not sure “Latinx” is the way to go.
Gender-driven languages present particular problems to overcome. Yet, language is a living, evolving phenomenon. Let’s see how it mutates.
(I still call myself a Chicano, by the way.)"

Exploring Selena’s legacy, from concerts to classrooms to Netflix
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

By this time tomorrow, Netflix will have released the first half of “Selena: The Series.” The first nine episodes of the long-awaited drama focus on the early struggles that the Tejano queen and her family band Los Dinos faced on their road to stardom.
I’m not a betting man — years of working in sports have taught me that the unexpected always happens — but if I were, I’d wager that the Netflix show will be a massive success. I don’t need to tell you that anything slapped with Selena’s name will be a moneymaker. I’m looking at you, MAC Cosmetics and Funko.
So far, “Selena: The Series” has had mixed reviews. My colleague Lorraine Ali thought it missed the mark, that it focused too much on Abraham and A.B. Quintanilla — the “dadager” and songwriting brother, respectively — and less on Selena.
I’ll spare you my thoughts because quite frankly I’m more interested in what you have to say about it. Seriously, send me an email at latinxfiles@latimes.com and tell me what you think.
The one thing I will say is that as a native of South Texas, where much of this story takes place, I was pleasantly taken aback to see names, faces and places that I grew up with. I really enjoyed seeing Pete Astudillo, a Tejano icon in his own right if only for that mullet, be recognized as the creative genius that he is. I also appreciated that the showrunners acknowledged the role that the legendary variety show host Johnny Canales played in helping launch Selena’s career — so much so that I even wrote a primer on “The Johnny Canales Show” and its legacy.
Retelling Selena’s story is no easy task. How could it be? Selena, along with Pacoima’s own Ritchie Valens, pelotero Roberto Clemente and comedian Freddie Prinze, are on the Latinx Mt. Rushmore of icons who were gone way too soon. (I’ve often wondered if that common thread, one of unfulfilled potential, is part of the broader Latinx ethos.)
The magnitude of this herculean task was not lost on actor Christian Serratos, who plays Selena.
I “knew I was never going to make everybody happy,” Serratos told my colleague Yvonne Villareal. “I knew that because she had that star quality. We all feel a sense of ownership when it comes to Selena — that’s my homie, that’s my family, that’s my sister.”
It doesn’t make it any easier when fans already have “Selena,” the 1997 Gregory Nava film that’s so ubiquitous it’s been memefied — “Anything for Selenas.”
Still, Jaime Dávila, one of the executive producers on “Selena: The Series,” hopes that the likely success of the Netflix show will open the door for Latinx creatives to tell stories other than Selena’s.
“More than anything, we’re trying to show Hollywood that there’s this huge market of Latinx/Latino people; that our stories are American stories; that our stories are global stories,” he told Yvonne for her profile of Dávila and his company Campanario.
“Being able to point to a story like ‘Selena: The Series,’ which is all of those things, is really great. I would love for more doors to open up.”
I would love that, too. But given Hollywood’s track record, I’ll believe it when I see it.
The time we went to go see Selena
One of the privileges of growing up in the Rio Grande Valley during the early ’90s was living in a time and place where seeing Selena in concert was a thing that people could do. My family did, in 1993 at the Feria de Reynosa across the border.
Miraculously, footage of that show exists online. Check out her questionable dreadlocks. Notice the tracking!
The specifics of what became our first concert experience are vague — I was 8 years old at the time, my brother Jeb was 6, and my sister Gloria was 4. Our recollection of that night can’t be trusted, so I spoke with my dad, my mom, y mi abuelita Paula — my maternal grandmother — for a more accurate account of what happened.
What everyone seems to remember is the size of the crowd.
“Fuimos a verla porque ella era de la gente,” my mom explained of Selena’s “of the people” image, pointing out that Reynosa’s annual fair had two stages: el palenque, which required paid admission, and el teatro del pueblo.
“El teatro del pueblo era para todos,” she added. “Era un ambiente más familiar.”
That’s her euphemistic way of saying that the concert was free. And because there was no charge and Selena was at the height of her fame, families like mine packed the venue long before the star — our star — was scheduled to perform. We arrived early, but not early enough.
Despite the packed crowd, everybody was calm. That lasted only until the band walked onstage.
“Se desordenó,” my old man told me. “El público se volvió loco, todos querían verla, todos se amontonaron.”
The orderly audience turned into a hysterical crowd wanting to be as close to Selena as possible. That included my grandmother and my sister.
“I remember wanting to see her up close, so Grandma took me by the hand saying, ‘vente, vente, vente!’ and then we started crawling under the benches until we got to the pit,” Gloria said.
“Nos fuimos muy emocionadas, y pues orale! Nos metimos por debajo de las bancas y nos cruzamos por debajo como soldados,” Paulita said, confirming my sister’s account of their mission.
“Tu abuelo se puso bien enojado después porque fuimos hacer el ridículo.”
My grandfather was furious, she said. I couldn’t confirm this with Lazaro because he was napping when I called, but it checks out.
In the end, my sister Gloria claims it was worth it just to have a glimpse of Selena. My grandmother insists it was too crowded for them to see.
“Gloria will say that not only did she get to see her, but that Selena invited her up to dance with her and even took her backstage,” Jeb joked of my sister’s propensity to view the past with a much rosier outlook.
Jeb doesn’t remember much, but my dad told me the two of us stayed back with him and took turns going up on his shoulders.
I asked my dad what he thought of a bunch of Mexicans in Mexico going this crazy for an American. A Mexican American, but an American no less.
“Pues su carisma era tan grande así,” he said after pausing to reflect on my question. “A la gente no les importo que era de allá.”
That’s when it hit me: The narrative that Selena was killed before she had a chance to cross over isn’t a real one. She did. Into Mexico, into a place where anything with roots north of the border is met with initial suspicion. That, to me, is a testament of just how big of a star she was and continues to be."

The COVID-19 vaccine and its importance to our community
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly devastating for Latinx Californians, and as we get closer to having a vaccine, convincing members of our community to get it could be a challenge.
According to a new report by my colleagues Rong-Gong Lin II, Andrew J. Campa and Luke Money, Latinx residents of Los Angeles County are becoming infected with the coronavirus at twice the rate as white residents.
We’re talking about a county where nearly 1 in 2 residents is Latinx.
It’s not just L.A. County. My colleagues also found that Latinx enclaves across California have also been hit hard by the pandemic. Places like the Central Valley and the Coachella Valley — big agricultural hubs — and the borderlands of San Ysidro and Calexico are being ravaged.
Latinxs account for nearly half of California’s 20,000 COVID-19 deaths, despite only accounting for 38% of the state’s population.
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand why our community is being hit disproportionately: Not many of us have the luxury and privilege of working from home.
You’re more likely to become infected the more you interact with people, and if you’re an essential worker, which Latinxs tend to be, you’re interacting with people on a regular basis (that’s if you’re lucky to be getting good hours).
Your chances of contracting COVID-19 are even higher if your employer fails to take adequate measures to protect you. That was the case at a Farmer John meatpacking plant in Vernon, which was fined last month after hundreds of workers were infected earlier this year.
But what’s the alternative? Si no trabajo, no como. If I don’t work, I don’t eat, as the adage says.
The imminent arrival of a vaccine is welcome news, but in order for some semblance of normality to return, people have to get it. Latinx people especially.
“We don’t get back to normal as a society until 70% or so of the population is immune to the virus,” Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at UC San Francisco, told my colleague Brittny Mejia, “and you just can’t get to 70% unless a lot of people that are a little skeptical about it are convinced to take it.”
That might be a tall order. In October, a poll found that 54% of Latinxs said they would get the vaccine once it became available. By comparison, 70% of Asian Americans, 62% of white people and 29% of Black respondents said the same.
There are many reasons why Latinxs might not want a vaccine. As Mejia found, they can range from fears of any potential side effects — not an unfounded one, given that Britain is investigating possible allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine — to much more selfish ones.
“I’ve never taken the flu shot,” one woman told her. “I hardly ever get sick.”
And then there are the so-called “pandejos,” a term coined by my colleague Gustavo Arellano to refer to those from our community who are not taking the pandemic seriously. I imagine they’d have their own reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated.
But the fact remains: If we want to start thinking about a post-pandemic life, enough people need to get the vaccine.
There’s hope that people might see the benefits of being vaccinated.
“They may over time begin to see that those people are allowed on an airplane or allowed to go into a workplace,” Wachter said. “It’s not at all inconceivable that there will become places where you can go if you’ve been vaccinated and you can’t go if you’re not.”
And President-elect Joe Biden nominating California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra for his health secretary is a good sign that the Latinx community will not be ignored as the pandemic continues. (Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, is the second Latinx person to be nominated to Biden’s cabinet; the first was Alejandro Mayorkas, who was picked to lead the Department of Homeland Security.)
“Having an individual who not only has outstanding qualifications, but also understands the needs of minority communities is imperative as our country moves forward in its fight against the pandemic,” Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) said of Becerra.
Of course, none of this matters if Latinx folks don’t get vaccinated. It bears repeating: If you want things to go back to some type of normal, you’ll need to get vaccinated."

Why we need a Latino museum
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Last Thursday, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah singlehandedly blocked a bipartisan effort to set up the National Museum of the American Latino, part of a proposed expansion of the Smithsonian Institution.
Lee argued that creating such a museum would be divisive, and that unlike Black and Native Americans, who have dedicated Smithsonian museums, Latinxs have not been “uniquely, deliberately and systemically excluded” and therefore did not deserve their own space.
It was that last part that really stuck with me. It lingered because it went against much of what I’ve come to learn about the history of Latinxs in the United States.
Mike Lee must not be familiar with his own state’s history. Otherwise he would know that what he calls Utah used to be part of Mexico — as were California, Nevada and Arizona and parts of Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming — and that it joined the Union only after President James K. Polk, not content with annexing Texas in 1845, used a border dispute as pretext to declare war against Mexico and go on a blatant land grab that fulfilled America’s so-called Manifest Destiny.
And if Mike Lee doesn’t know about that, what chance is there that he or millions like him would know about the thousands of lynchings of Mexicans and Mexican Americans across the Southwest that followed for nearly a century afterward?
What’s the likelihood that they would know that La Matanza and the Porvenir massacre were carried out by the Texas Rangers? That these extrajudicial mass murders were executed by a law enforcement agency so beloved in the state that they have a professional baseball team named after them, and that they’re a prime example of how Latinxs have indeed been “uniquely, deliberately and systemically” targeted?
Or that decades later, the Eisenhower administration would launch “Operation Wetback,” a mass deportation campaign that resulted in many American citizens being uprooted and kicked out of their own homes?
Or what about the fact that Latinx soldiers were disproportionately killed in action during the Vietnam War but we’ll never actually know just how many because the U.S. government classified them as racially white? This overrepresentation of Latinx soldiers in Vietnam, by the way, was the impetus for the Chicano Moratorium, which just had its 50th anniversary.
These and other incidents are often overlooked, which is tragic because of what they say about history — it tends to repeat itself. This brief and noncomprehensive list of violence against Latinxs put together by my colleague Paloma Esquivel drove that point home in the days after the 2019 El Paso mass shooting.
An even bigger tragedy is that none of our history is really being told outside of the university level. It took going to college in another part of the country for me to learn about what took place on the very land where I grew up.
I’m not alone in this.
Back in October, Mario T. Garcia, a professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies at UC Santa Barbara, told me that many of his freshmen are surprised to learn that the history of our people is foundational to the story of this nation because it had never been taught to them. They don’t know that the first European settlers in what became the United States spoke Spanish.
“The very names of our cities and our mountain ranges and our rivers,” Garcia said, “I say to my students, ‘Those names didn’t come with the Mayflower.’”
In an op-ed published by The Times on Wednesday, Stephen Pitti, a professor of history, American studies, and ethnicity, race and migration at Yale University, argued that the best antidote for the widespread ignorance of American Latinx history is the museum Mike Lee objected to.
“A new national museum would be able to tackle this complex narrative under one roof,” Pitti wrote. “It may not be able to present every aspect of this vast history, but it could greatly expand public understanding of a central part of this country’s heritage.”
(Side note: All that stuff about Porvenir and the Texas Rangers, I learned about it over a decade ago in Pitti’s “History of Mexican Americans since 1848"" class, which, I am ashamed to say, I failed. It was a dark time in my life.)
Pitti’s right: What this country doesn’t know about Latinxs could certainly fill a museum, and it’s long overdue that one be built — one that not only chronicles the injustices but also highlights the myriad contributions made by people with roots in Latin America over the course of centuries.
Relying on the Smithsonian to do a better job at incorporating more exhibits about Latinx history and culture, as Lee suggested, isn’t going to cut it. In a recent column, my colleague Carolina Miranda gives a great overview of how the institution has failed to do that exact thing since it released a self-assessment in 1994 that called this exclusion a “willful neglect.”
Thankfully, the National Museum of the American Latino isn’t dead yet. Congress can still approve the creation of this much-needed space by adding to the spending bill that funds our government.
Even if the effort fails, the fact remains: You can’t properly capture the story of America without properly capturing Latinx stories. The museum would bring us one step closer to that."

Will there ever be a ‘Decade of the Latinx’?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

As 1989 came to a close, the late, great Frank del Olmo — the first Latinx journalist to be named to the Los Angeles Times masthead — took stock of how much progress our community had made during the 1980s, which had been dubbed “the Decade of the Hispanic” in the news media and in advertising because of our burgeoning population growth.
For Del Olmo, the term “was contrived and artificial,” a glib attempt at getting Latinxs to consume more, and conjured up images of brown people drinking beer.
“As near as I can remember, the phrase was first widely used in the Los Angeles area as part of an advertising campaign in the early ’80s,” he wrote. “Then, as now, the Coors Brewing Co. saw the Latino community as a growing market for its beer. So it plastered billboards all around town of a smiling Latino holding a beer and toasting the world as he proclaimed Coors ‘the beer for the Decade of the Hispanic.’”
Del Olmo concluded that calling the 1980s the Decade of the Hispanic was inaccurate, that “the progress for Latinos it was supposed to symbolize began long before” and that it would “continue into the 1990s.”
As we embark on a new decade (contrary to popular belief, this one started on Jan. 1, 2021, not last year), I’ve found myself thinking about Del Olmo’s column and the term a lot lately.
He was right in challenging the notion that the 1980s were a golden decade for Latinxs. It was a consequential 10 years for sure, one that saw the rise of Fernandomania and the passage of the so-called amnesty law of 1986 that granted citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants — but did the decade truly belong to us? Absolutely not. In fact, a report released in 1989 by UnidosUS, then known as the National Council of La Raza, found that the income disparity between Latinx and white Americans had widened during that period.
But Del Olmo‘s expectation that the ‘90s would be a period of prosperity and prominence for Latinxs would prove wrong. On the contrary, it would bring their vilification. The decade that gave us grunge and nü metal also gave us Gov. Pete Wilson and Proposition 187, the anti-immigration ballot initiative that he championed and California voters passed in 1994, fueling the same anti-Latinx and nativist sentiment that resulted in Donald Trump becoming president. (Side note: The Los Angeles Times launched a podcast in 2019 about the legacy and history of Prop. 187. You can listen to it here.)
It’s clear that Latinxs have never had our long-promised decade, a period in which our presence is felt and our culture is at the forefront of the mainstream. Will we ever?
My gut says yes, and there are some signs that give me hope. Bad Bunny, for example, is the biggest pop star in the world. It took him just a few years to go from a grocery bagger in Puerto_Rico to Spotify’s most streamed artist of 2020. That’s the type of energy we need.
But demographics alone won’t shape the future. They didn’t in the 1980s or the 1990s. Our population has grown significantly in such a short period of time and will keep growing — according to the Census, there will be 111 million of us by 2060, and two out of every seven Americans will be Latinx — but our place in this country hasn’t changed much. We are very much here, but white America doesn’t much seem to notice.
If we are to have that moment in the spotlight, if we are to be more than just consumers, if we are going to have a say on what’s to come, something else needs to happen. We’re missing that key ingredient.
Who knows what that might be — but I’m hoping to find out. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be talking to demographers, economists, technologists, historians, academics and artists to try to get a sense of what the future will look like for Latinxs and what, if anything, can be done to take ownership of the next 10 years."

What will the future of Latinx television look like?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

When Peter Murrieta’s show “Greetings From Tucson” premiered in the fall of 2002, he thought it was the beginning of a Latinx boom in television. His show, based on his own experience growing up, came months after the ABC premiere of “George Lopez,” another sitcom about a middle-class Mexican American family.
“I guess because I was a young writer then and I wrote my first pilot and it got shot, I just assumed that we were edging towards that kind of storytelling,” he said.
Nearly 20 years later, the promise of brown faces telling brown stories on prime-time TV remains unfulfilled, and it’s not hard to understand why.
“You’re in L.A, you’ve got to try not to hire Mexicans,” comedian Chris Rock wrote of Hollywood executives in a 2014 essay in the Hollywood Reporter.
It’s 2021 and the powers that be are still ignoring Latinx stories, choosing instead to take nostalgia programming and reheat it for high definition television. Just ask yourself: Who are reboots like “Roseanne,” “Mad About You” and “Sex and the City” for? “Roseanne” premiered more than 30 years ago (October 1988), which is older than the median age for Latinxs . Qué hueva.
The good news is that much has changed since then. Network television is no longer the end-all, be-all of small-screen entertainment.
“Obviously, we’re in a streaming world,” said Murrieta, who most recently was a co-executive producer for Netflix’s “Mr. Iglesias,” a sitcom starring comedian Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias, adding that the advent of streaming had forced him to reevaluate what success looks like.
“We’ve always collectively looked at getting a prime-time drama or sitcom as such a big accomplishment — all the while their viewership has been going down and down and down precipitously. And so I think you almost have to pick up your your tent poles and move on from that campground and just go, ‘OK, well, it didn’t happen here. So we’re going to go on elsewhere now.’”
Indeed, Netflix has done a much better job at telling Latinx stories with series such as “On My Block” and “Gentefied.” But it’s also gotten it wrong, displaying very little patience for shows with diverse casts that weren’t immediate successes and canceling them outright. “Ashley Garcia: Genius in Love,” a show that presented a new, positive archetype — the Latina genius — lasted only 15 episodes.
Interestingly enough, glimpses of what the future of Latinx television might look like can be found on Telemundo. Yes, really.
In 2020, the Spanish-centric network launched a YouTube news and commentary program called “Radar 2020” (Now “Radar 2021”) done in English hoping to court the same type of audience this newsletter is going after: bicultural, bilingual or English-dominant Latinxs based in the United States. The program is much lighter than your typical Telemundo news broadcast and covers topics rarely talked about on the network or elsewhere. The show has shined a light on racism and colorism within our culture, on queer Latinx identity and on how climate change disproportionately affects communities of color. An upcoming episode will be devoted entirely to equal pay for Latinas.
It makes sense that Telemundo would experiment with English-language programming. Studies have shown that the younger the Latinx, the more likely they are to be English-proficient or English-dominant, and given that nearly 6 in 10 Latinxs are millennials or younger, sticking to Spanish-only programming could prove to be an existential threat to the network.
“If you would have asked me a few years ago if I ever saw myself working at Telemundo, I would have said ‘Absolutely not,’” said host Gabriela Fresquez, who also co-writes the scripts. “I’m primarily English-speaking, and it was always the network that my parents or my tías would watch.”
Though “Radar 2021” is still in its infancy and working on building up its audience, the show has the full backing of network higher-ups, executive producer Grace González told me. “I think just getting people used to the fact that we’re doing something in English, coming from such a strong Spanish brand, is the hardest part.”
But if you really want to know what the future of Latinx television might be like, the best place to look for clues is everyone’s favorite video-sharing social network: TikTok.
The rise in popularity of TikTok should be taken seriously. In a July 2020 letter to shareholders, Netflix name-checked the app as one of its competitors, an acknowledgement that it’s as much a threat for audiences’ attention as Disney+. Pretty soon, the most-downloaded app of 2020 will also literally be television — Samsung recently announced that TikTok would come pre-installed in its smart TVs in the U.K. and has plans to expand to the rest of Europe.
The platform has been a boon for Latinx creators of all types. Folks like Adam Martinez (better known by his alter ego Rosa), Sienna Mae Gomez and the father-son duo of the Enkyboys (Ava DuVernay was so impressed by them that it’s said she wants to cast them in a project) have amassed millions of fans. Nathan Apodaca, better known as Doggface208, became an overnight sensation because of a TikTok video where he’s riding his longboard while listening to Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams.” Such was the interest he garnered that my colleague Laura Zornoza’s profile of him was one of the most popular stories on our site last year.
(I promise you that I’m going to ask my colleague Gabby Fernandez to write the definitive guide to LatinoTok. But in writing this newsletter I learned of the work of Leo Gonzalez and Maya Murillo, became a fan and would highly recommend you follow them.)
These creators have grown massive followings organically because there aren’t any gatekeepers on that platform.
Murrieta, an admitted TikTok lurker, sees similarities between the TikTokers and Gabriel Iglesias, the star of his show.
“When you talk about the system, Gabriel wasn’t originally welcomed into it. He had to go out and build it all on his own. He created his own audience. In many ways, he was the precursor to what we’re seeing now.”"

How L.A.’s Latinx LGBTQ community hopes to save the New Jalisco Bar
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Among the things endangered by the COVID-19 pandemic has been the New Jalisco Bar in downtown Los Angeles. As my colleague Andrea Castillo notes in her Column One story from Monday, the New Jalisco Bar is more than just a watering hole. It has been a lifeline for the city’s Latinx LGBTQ community since the early 2000s. After nearly a year of being closed, New Jalisco is on the brink of disappearing.
New Jalisco wasn’t always an LGBTQ space. When Maria Rosa Garcia, the current owner, first started working there in 1992, it was a billiards bar called the Jalisco Inn. By the time the Score, the only gay bar in downtown L.A., closed in 2005, Garcia had assumed ownership of the Jalisco Inn, and under the insistence of her husband Sergio Hernandez, she decided to fill that void.
“We have to recognize that this is a gay bar,” Hernandez said.
Since then, New Jalisco bar has been a refuge for the Latinx LGBTQ community, a “jotería space,” as Eddy Francisco Alvarez Jr., an assistant professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Cal State Fullerton, puts it.
“We can show up and be Latino, Chicano, immigrant, Afro-Latino, femme and trans — all of those intersecting identities,” he said, “and just be who we want to be. And be messy.”
“Jalisco to me feels like going to, like, a family quinceañera,” Gabriela Ruiz, 29, a queer performance artist, told Castillo.
“Everyone there is like your gay uncle.”
But then the pandemic hit. At first, Garcia and Hernandez thought the shutdown gave them a chance to renovate the space. The couple invested their savings in upgrading the plumbing and creating a dressing room for drag performers. That optimism has turned to worry. Though the bar has remained closed, bills have been piling up. They owe $55,000 on back rent alone.
Without their livelihood, Garcia and Hernandez have had to make do elsewhere. Garcia started selling tacos in front of her home in South L.A. while Hernandez has been working for a moving company. Because of their legal status, they couldn’t apply for a Paycheck Protection Program loan that would help with keeping New Jalisco afloat.
All is not lost, however. In December, Ruiz helped Garcia set up a GoFundMe campaign to help raise $80,000 to cover expenses. When The Times published Castillo’s story on Monday, the effort had raised more than half the money. As of this writing, the campaign has surpassed $70,000.
“Gay bars have survived political oppression, the AIDS crisis, previous recessions, so they will survive this pandemic,” noted Greggor Mattson, a sociology professor at Oberlin College in Ohio."

‘Cheat codes’ hurting COVID vaccine rollout in Latinx and Black communities
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

On Monday, my colleague Julia Wick (who also writes the Essential California newsletter, which you should sign up for) reported that a California program aimed at closing the vaccination gap for Black and Latinx neighborhoods was being exploited by outsiders who wouldn’t otherwise qualify for the vaccine under current state guidelines.
The program created access codes that enabled members of these hard-hit groups to make appointments on the state’s vaccine scheduling website. But there was a problem. These codes ended up being shared via group texts and email chains with people who don’t belong to these communities.
Some of these individuals told The Times that they didn’t know that the code they received was intended for Black and Latinx communities, noting that nothing in the language of the text or email they received said anything about the program.
A 32-year-old white man who works in tech and lives in Berkeley said he found out what he had done only after receiving a push alert for Wick’s report while he was waiting in the recovery area after getting his first dose.
“It’s very confusing and perplexing how little information there is about this,” he said, asking to remain anonymous because a work contact had passed him the code.
“Nobody thinks they’re doing something wrong,” said another woman, who didn’t use the code but declined to give her name.
“They honestly have convinced themselves to believe that this is leftovers, that this is pilot testing, open to everyone.”
On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom acknowledged the loophole.
“We’re going to go away from group codes to individual codes,” he said at a news conference. “We’re hopeful that we can work out the bugs.”
But as Times columnist Erika D. Smith notes, maybe these glitches in the system aren’t bugs at all, but actual features.
“What if the problem that needs solving by Newsom isn’t the order in which people can book their appointments online, but rather the fact that people have to get online at all?”
Smith goes on to point out that California’s vaccination system isn’t taking into account the digital divide that exists and disproportionately affects Black and Latinx neighborhoods. It’s the same technology gap that showed itself at the start of the pandemic when the L.A. Unified School District switched to online classrooms.
It’s not just California, either. Both of my parents were able to get vaccinated in Texas only because my tech-literate siblings ensured that our folks had appointments. I wouldn’t be surprised if many of you have had to deal with the same issues.
Whether intentional or not, the system keeps failing Black and Latinx communities. The vaccine rollout in California is yet another example of this very harsh truth, and while incidents like these aren’t the sole reason white and wealthier areas in Los Angeles County have a higher share of their populations vaccinated than neighborhoods of color, they certainly don’t help."

Netflix has a Latinx problem
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

On Friday, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative released a detailed report analyzing representation in front of and behind the camera at Netflix, and the numbers were dismal.
According to the report, which took a look at 126 U.S. Netflix movies and 180 scripted shows made in 2018 and 2019, only 2.6% of all stories had a Latinx lead or co-lead and only 4.5% of main cast members were Latinx.
Behind the camera, the report found that only one director, one writer and five producers had worked for a Netflix-produced film in that period. On Netflix series, only 2.7% of creators, 2.6% of producers, and 2.5% of writers and directors were Latinx.
These figures aren’t a surprise, but are still disappointing.
“We’ve released this report in the interests of transparency,” said Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos. “Because without this kind of information it’s very hard to judge whether we’re improving or not. And the report makes clear that while Netflix has made advances in representation year-over-year, we still have a long way to go.”
Netflix is by its own admission a data-driven company. Surely, then, the company is aware that Latinx millennials prefer their platform over others, according to this report by Horowitz Research. The streamer has become so ubiquitous and so accessible among Latinx households that my immigrant father doesn’t need my help to use it. (He’s very partial to heist shows — he won’t shut up about the Spanish series “La Casa de Papel.”)
The audience is right there, already willing to watch. Just look at the success of the “Selena” series, which became Netflix’s most-streamed show after it premiered, despite being panned by critics and people on social media.
Don’t stop there. Give us a show about Latinxs in space or traveling through time. Put a Mexican American kid in “Stranger Things” — trust me, they existed in Indiana during the 1980s. Do a horror series on the chupacabra or a psychedelic dystopian sci-fi movie. A miniseries on the Fania All Stars. How about a Latinx “Bridgerton”? I promise you, we will watch it all.
Latinxs have a million stories to tell — and we are good at telling them. All Netflix needs to do is let us tell them."

Do these Latinx movies deserve to be in the National Film Registry?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

According to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the National Film Registry needs more Latinx movies.
For the unfamiliar, the registry is a list of “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films” picked by the Library of Congress’ National Film Preservation Board. The 775-movie list is intended to encapsulate America’s film heritage and history. It includes movies like “The Wizard of Oz,” “North by Northwest” and “Die Hard.”
It also only includes 17 Latinx films — “La Bamba,” “Stand and Deliver” and “Buena Vista Social Club” among them.
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus doesn’t think this is enough. In January, it petitioned that “Selena” be added to the registry. Last week, it followed up with a list of 25 other films (that’s the number of movies added each year by the board) it believes “reflect the diversity of Latino identities, histories, geographies, and political perspectives.” You can see the full list here.
“Hollywood is the main image-defining and narrative-producing industry in the United States,” the caucus said in a letter to the board.
“As you know, Latinos remain dramatically underrepresented in this influential industry, contributing to the misperceptions and stereotypes about Latinos in our society. In effect, when we cannot tell our stories, others will tell stories about us.”
Does the caucus have a point? Absolutely!
It’s ridiculous that “Selena” isn’t already included. The legend of the slain pop star is one of the few cultural markers of pan-Latinx identity that just about everyone agrees on, and the Gregory Nava movie is an indispensable component of that myth.
There’s also “Blood In, Blood Out,” the 1993 Taylor Hackford epic that follows the lives of three Chicano cousins from East Los Angeles. Though initially panned by The Times — recently retired critic Kenneth Turan called it “a potboiler more concerned than not with getting an exploitative rise out of an audience” in his review — the movie has withstood the test of time and is easily a vital part of the Chicanx film canon. Such is the cultural impact of “Blood In, Blood Out” that it made “El Pino,” a bunya tree central to the movie’s story, a tourist destination.
But is every film suggested by the Hispanic caucus worthy of being in the registry? Hardly.
Take “Frida” and “The Motorcycle Diaries.” Two good movies for sure, but they hardly speak to the American Latinx experience. Perhaps the caucus couldn’t come up with a full list and they threw those in for good measure.
Still, kudos to the Hispanic caucus for doing this. Despite being historically shut out from Hollywood, when given the opportunity Latinx filmmakers have still managed to tell our stories, and the best of their work is an integral part of America’s film heritage that deserves to be preserved."

The trouble with the border ‘crisis’
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

If you’ve kept up with the news in the last month, chances are you’ve heard or read about what’s often called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where people from Central America have been migrating in waves after Joe Biden became president.
The numbers paint a more complicated picture. One recent analysis published by the Washington Post of data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection found no such crisis. Tom K. Wong, associate professor and director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at UC San Diego, and UCSD graduate students Gabriel De Roche and Jesus Rojas Venzor attributed the rise in apprehensions to the seasonal nature of undocumented immigration, which has historically gone up during this time of the year. There was a similar uptick in apprehensions around this time in 2018 and 2019.
But what about the fact that border crossings are on pace to be the highest in two decades? According to Wong, De Roche and Rojas Venzor, that increase is due at least partially to the pandemic. They note that “in fiscal year 2021, it appears that migrants are continuing to enter the United States in the same numbers as in fiscal year 2019 — plus the pent-up demand from people who would have come in fiscal year 2020, but for the pandemic.”
Their conclusion — that the numbers risk being blown out of proportion and need proper context — is consistent with what my colleague Cindy Carcamo wrote about in her explainer from last week on the rise in the number of unaccompanied minors at the border.
Carcamo points out that Customs and Border Protection changed their terminology in 2020, moving from apprehensions to encounters. “It’s problematic to compare them, because encounters can mean multiple attempted crossings by one person, artificially inflating the numbers,” she notes. “CBP estimates the rate of recidivism, or repeat crossings, at 40%.”
But the real tragedy in all of this is that it doesn’t seem to matter what’s really going on at the border.
The moment the phrase “border crisis” is uttered, it is willed into existence. Broadcast media aren’t helping. According to an analysis by Media Matters, a left-leaning watchdog group, the major television news outlets have used the word “surge” or border “crisis” at least 138 times in 2021. Just last week, ABC News’ Sunday punditry show, “This Week,” filmed next to the border wall in El Paso.
If you repeat it enough, folks will believe it’s definite. Once they do, the optics of a crisis at the border become a liability for one political party and a weapon for the other.
Last week, the Democratic-controlled House passed a bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers and would grant permanent residence to people with temporary protection status. I don’t need a crystal ball to tell you that this bill doesn’t have a chance in the Senate under current rules.
Nearly all legislation currently requires 60 votes to circumvent a Senate filibuster. Democrats have an option to enact policy through a special legislative procedure that doesn’t allow for a filibuster and would require only 50 votes for passage. But there are limitations to what kind of legislation can be approved in this method, such as that all policies have to be directly related to the federal budget, and it is unclear how much immigration policy can be enacted this way.
Senate Democrats do not have the 60 votes they would need. Their Republican colleagues have all but said so themselves.
“Unfortunately, what’s happening at the border right now is going to inflame people’s emotions a lot, and I think make anything harder to do, which I think is very regrettable,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) recently told reporters.
“I think it’s going to be really hard to get a bipartisan bill put together on anything that has a legalization component until you stop the flow,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been on both sides of the immigration reform debate so many times that his position on the matter also feels cyclical.
We have been here before. Democrats held the House and the Senate at the start of Barack Obama’s presidency, and there was promise of immigration reform. Then it was derailed by a manufactured crisis at the border, and nothing came to pass.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
For Boston Globe opinion columnist Marcela Garcia, the fixation on calling it a crisis does more harm than it helps.
“We’re seeing another cycle of overblown rhetoric about the border,” she writes. “The nation has a new chance at passing historic immigration legislation that fully embraces the millions of undocumented young people and workers living in the shadows, and other Biden-sponsored plans to give targeted aid to Central America. Instead, we’re debating semantics. That’s the real crisis.”
Lather, rinse, repeat."

How some Latinxs are looking to create generational wealth
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

I can’t remember the exact details of the moment it dawned on me that I’ll eventually have to take care of my parents when they’re older, but I must have been 4 or 5. My dad got appendicitis and was taken to a hospital across the border. My siblings and I stayed home with an older cousin, and while the adults were gone, I got it in my mind that I’d find every spare coin in the house and start a little fund to cover future catastrophes.
My dad ended up being fine, and having the procedure in Mexico didn’t require tapping into the whopping $10 and change I was able to scrounge — but that reality of needing to repay the sacrifices made on my behalf has been stuck in the front of my brain ever since.
That same sense of obligation can be found in some of the subjects interviewed by my colleagues Jackeline Luna and Samantha Masunaga for their story on Black and Latinx retail investors from South Los Angeles who have taken to platforms like Webull and Robinhood in hopes of building up generational wealth.
“It’s always been on my head that if my parents brought me here when I was 7, I have to make something out of myself,” Royer Levith Elvir, a 23-year-old whose family fled violence in Honduras in 2004, told my colleagues.
Elvir wakes up every weekday at 4 a.m. to start trading in the premarket hours. In addition to retail investing, he’s a full-time electrical engineering student at Cal State L.A. His hope is that his future includes multiple income streams.
Folks like Elvir and Blanca Lopez, a 23-year-old senior home case manager from South L.A., see apps like Robinhood as tools that could help them secure long-term financial security and bridge the wealth gap. According to the Federal Reserve, in 2019 the typical white family had eight times the wealth of a typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Latinx family.
“People from here that grew up in the hood, we’re going to be making big money,” Lopez told The Times. “It’s not going to be people coming in to buy their homes, it’s going to be our generation that’s going to be buying properties.”
It bears mentioning that while these platforms have made it easier for people traditionally shut out from the stock market to invest, they have also made it easier for them to lose their money. The biggest culprit is perhaps Robinhood, which has gamified the process of buying and selling stocks, and was at the center of the recent GameStop frenzy.
There’s no guarantee that Elvir and Lopez will achieve their financial goals, but it’s hard not to root for them. Theirs is ultimately a story of young Latinxs literally betting on themselves.
Also, a big shoutout to my colleagues for doing a story on Latinx wealth — it’s a topic I feel doesn’t get much media attention."

A novelist’s fierce homage to New Mexico’s Latinx heritage
BY MEREDITH MARAN

The short stories of Kirstin Valdez Quade, several of which The New York Times anointed “legitimate masterpieces,” earned her a royal flush of awards — from the National Book Critics Circle, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Book Foundation and others. “The Five Wounds,” Quade’s debut novel, deserves that kind of acclaim and more. Like her stories, the novel is sheathed in sensate layers of the Northern New Mexico landscape: rough, rocky, high-desert scrabble and sagebrush scrub; the scent of piñon burning in the horno, Lotaburgers oozing green chili grease onto plastic lace tablecloths, tortillas grilling on the comal. But the novel’s driving force is its characters’ raw longings — the personal and social unrest that simmers in the Land of Enchantment, home of the author’s heart.
“My family has a centuries-long history in New Mexico,” Quade told me. “Through many moves in my life, my grandmother’s house and my extended family remains the one consistent home, the home I return to. Because of my ever-changing circumstances, it’s only in my fiction that I can do that.”
Following an itinerant childhood digging up soil samples and kangaroo skulls with her geologist father, Quade, a voracious reader, built herself a high-velocity life in words. MFA in hand, she was published in The New Yorker before she turned 30 — starting with her 2009 short story “The Five Wounds,” the basis for the new novel.
In these pages, we meet five generations of the Padilla family in the fictional village of Las Penas, New Mexico. After fighting with her mom, 15-year-old Angel shows up pregnant, scared and entitled (she feels) to the care of her grandmother, Yolanda. But Yolanda is busy babying Amadeo, Angel’s 33-year-old layabout dad. A cascade of calamities ensues, with pathos and humor intertwined.
“The Five Wounds” is a pick for Roxane Gay’s Audacious Book Club, with starred reviews from the trades and early raves from O Magazine and renowned authors including Luis Alberto Urrea and Colm Tóibín. Reached at Princeton University, admittedly jittery on the eve of publication, Quade spoke to the Times about New Mexico’s fraught history, her path to publication and the importance of books (like hers) that make readers laugh.
I miss my family! I miss the big parties in my grandmother’s living room with so many relatives who are gone now. I miss my great-grandmother, who cared for me when I was a kid; I miss her tortillas and the smell of the elevator in her building. I miss my grandfather. He died of Covid in October. I wish I’d been able to be with him at the end — I’d always promised him that I would if I could. When I started writing, it was to fill the gaps in their stories, missing details they couldn’t or wouldn’t explain.
I’ve also spent my whole life trying to understand the larger tangle of New Mexico’s history and identity and power. The state has a long, painful history of people being pushed off the land. The Spanish forcibly took land from the many Native American communities and then, as acreage became valuable for ranching, land shifted increasingly into the hands of white settlers and the U.S. government. Those tensions, those losses are still very much felt today. That’s one reason I find it such a fertile place for fictional exploration.
How did you go from New Mexico to literary success?
We moved a lot and we accompanied my dad on his field trips, mostly around the deserts of the southwest. My parents and little sister and I spent months at a time living out of our VW van, in tents, in the field. I read my way through our travels. And every time we passed through a different town, I imagined what life would be like living there — which was, of course, perfect training to write fiction. When I was going to public high school in Tucson, a recruiter for Phillips Exeter Academy came and passed out brochures. I applied, and I got in with a full scholarship. Exeter, then Stanford, opened me to more and more opportunities. I took amazing literature classes, and I got to know some working writers. Meeting them made a writing life seem possible.
How did you expand the short story “The Five Wounds” into the novel?
A couple of years after the story was published, my book editor asked if I would consider turning it into a novel. I said “No. It’s a story!” I couldn’t see it any other way. A while after that, I was looking at some story drafts and I noticed they all dealt with the same family structure: a mother, her grown, unemployed son and his estranged daughter. I realized I was doing exactly what my editor had suggested.
Digging into that novel: When Amadeo’s passive-aggressive sister gives him a copy of “Breaking Free From the Prison of Male Rage,” you write, “Thanks to that book, Amadeo has discovered new depths of male rage. He will never forgive his sister, ever.” Do you puzzle over the funny lines in the book, or do they simply flow from the characters?
Those moments come out of the characters. As a reader and as a writer, I’m drawn to work that incorporates humor. The darkest times in my life have always contained some element of humor. Laughter, plays on words, all sorts of comedy are big parts of my experience of being a human in the world and in my relationships.
“The Five Wounds” points to inequities and injustices, including the targets of recent movements for social change. What do you want your readers to feel and do as a result of reading this novel?
What I most hope is that readers will care about my characters. I hope they’ll laugh, that they’ll be moved by the story. My job as a writer is to allow my characters to be as fully human and complicated as we all are. Art is a tool. It can be used to injure. It can be used as propaganda. It can be used to advance the agenda of a fascist state. We’ve seen art used in those ways. But art can also challenge us to see our common humanity, to empathize with people who are unlike us. That’s the art I want to be around. That’s the art I want to make."

Why do we need Latinx heroes?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

When I was in high school, I won an essay contest whose prize was a weeklong trip to Washington, D.C. I don’t recall the precise essay prompt; I just remember that we had to write about a hero of ours and how they inspired us to do good.
I picked Cesar Chavez mostly because he was the only famous Mexican American I could think of, and I felt like his mission to bring dignity and a fair wage to farmworkers — the stuff I’d learned about at school — was something I could easily align myself with. I, too, wanted to make this a better world for my people.
A few years later, I wrote a letter to the editor of my college paper (ugh, I know, I was — am? — that guy) admonishing my school’s MEChA chapter for launching a campaign to get Cesar Chavez’s birthday turned into a federal holiday. It wasn’t that I objected to their larger effort. What I took issue with was their claim that Chavez fought for the rights of immigrants.
At some point between when I wrote the essay and the letter, I learned that in his efforts to achieve his goals, Chavez organized “wet lines,” essentially farmworkers-turned-border minutemen who called la migra on undocumented workers. Being from an extended family with mixed immigration status, I decided then and there that Chavez was no longer my people.
I’ve been thinking about these two incidents a lot after reading my colleague Gustavo Arellano’s latest column, which details his own complicated feelings towards the late labor activist. In it Arellano brings up some of Chavez’s other shortcomings — his role in erasing Filipino farmworkers from his movement — before reaching the conclusion that these people we call heroes are human, and humans are inherently flawed. Chavez isn’t an exception.
“History — life — is not an easy-peasy snap-judgment call,” Arellano writes. “To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: Every saint had a past, and every sinner has a future.”
Yesterday was Cesar Chavez Day, a federally recognized holiday since 2014. Do I think he deserves his own holiday? Yeah, probably. There’s a day for everything — in addition to being April Fool’s Day, it is also “National One Cent Day” and “Take Down Tobacco National Day of Action” — so why not give one to one of the greatest leaders of the labor movement?
I understand the desire to protect Cesar Chavez’s legacy. It’s not like Latinxs have many well-known heroes to begin with. In 1983, The Times conducted a poll (as part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning series “Latinos”) asking the city’s Latinx residents to name their heroes. Respondents struggled with that question.
“Other than Fernando Valenzuela, I couldn’t tell you who are our heroes,” said Francisco Perez of East L.A. “We don’t have that many picked up by the media.”
It was the lack of options that led Times readers in 1983 and me in high school to pick Chavez as our default choice. But that alone shouldn’t shield him from the truth of who he was and what he did.
I don’t have to look far to understand that heroes can be flawed and human. After all this time, I’ve come to the realization that the only people I truly consider heroic are my own parents. To this day I am still in awe of the life they’ve been able to build for us despite limited resources and opportunities. I can also attest to the fact that they are flawed individuals.
It’s possible to admire someone while still being aware of their imperfections. It’s when you put them on a pedestal that you run into issues. Some people’s desire to elevate things or people often goes hand in hand with other people’s desire to knock them down."

‘An educational pandemic’ for English learners in California schools
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

At the risk of being repetitive, the COVID-19 pandemic has been disproportionately devastating for the Latinx community in Los Angeles and across the country.
The latest confirmation of this tragic truism can be found in my colleague Paloma Esquivel’s report on how the progress of English learners in California’s schools has been endangered by the pandemic shutdown.
“It’s an educational pandemic,” Martha Hernandez, the director of a nonprofit that advocates for English learners, told The Times. “We already had issues of an achievement gap, opportunity gaps, lack of access, lack of equity. Now that’s just exacerbated, and it will be a huge challenge. It will have a big impact for many, many years.”
California has more than 1.1 million students classified as English learners. Nearly 80% of them are Spanish speakers. As Esquivel notes, these students have faced educational challenges long before the start of the pandemic. In 1998, California voters approved Proposition 227, which ended bilingual education in the state. It was a disaster — voters repealed those rules in 2016 by passing Proposition 58.
Then came the pandemic, which brought with it the additional challenges of distance learning and isolation.
“Our kids were already behind,” said Francisco Lozano, a parent organizer and father of an English learner in the fifth grade. “But now? If the districts and the schools don’t start doing what they need to do, we’ll all be left behind.”
That fear is understandable. As we near the end of the shutdown — California is slated to reopen fully by June 15 — many people will find themselves in a worse position coming out of it than how they went into it. The pandemic has repeatedly exposed the inequities in our society. Only time will tell if we fix them or if we’ll let these bigger inequity gaps become the new normal."

The cruelty of Biden’s immigration policy
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

President Biden promised to bring “human dignity” to the U.S. immigration system. But his administration’s continued use of a Trump-era policy has cast doubt on that stated goal.
Back in March 2020, Trump invoked Title 42, an obscure public health statute from 1944 that allows the president to deny entry into the United States to foreign nationals who might spread a communicable disease. The start of the COVID-19 pandemic gave Trump an excuse to shut down the border and have immigrants caught trying to enter the U.S. without authorization expelled quickly into Mexico. The Biden administration has kept that immigration enforcement tool in place in an effort to stem criticism from political opponents who see a growing crisis at the border.
But as my colleague Molly O’Toole reports, Title 42 has become “a gold rush for human smugglers.” She spoke with several Central American asylum seekers who were kidnapped after being removed to Mexico, and with their families, who were extorted.
Among them is Karen Cruz Caceres, a single mother from Honduras who was just granted asylum. Her pregnant sister Tani wasn’t as lucky. She and her 4-year-old son were abducted in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and the kidnappers wanted more than $20,000 in ransom.
“My sister and my nephew were told they were going to kill them and feed them to the dogs,” Cruz Caceres told The Times.
“If [U.S. officials] want to deport them back to their country, why don’t they do it now like prior presidents did? Why dump them to try their luck in the most dangerous cities in Mexico, to get abducted by kidnappers?”
The logic behind Biden keeping Title 42 in place is that he needs to look tough on border enforcement now so that he can pass meaningful immigration reform later. I’ve written in the past about how claims of a crisis at the border have been used to derail a change from the status quo.
Given the president’s statements on the subject during a speech to a joint session of Congress last night, the reality of how tough it will be to pass his preferred legislation appears to be dawning on him. “If Congress won’t pass my plan, let’s at least pass what we agree on,” he said, signaling a move toward a more piecemeal approach to policy rather than an all-or-nothing one.
And if that’s really the case, if Biden is already conceding ground before the fight even starts, then that makes Title 42 an unnecessary evil. There’s little moral difference between using Title 42 to implement a nationalist immigration agenda and doing it as a means to a different political end, especially when the road to real immigration reform looks perilous."

The secret behind this queer, Latinx-owned plant shop is 4 words: Come as you are
BY JULISSA JAMES

On a recent morning, the fog outside in Long Beach is thick, but the vibes inside Kevin Alcaraz and Anthony Diaz’s spacious shop, Plantiitas, are bright and welcoming. There’s a statue of La Virgen perched high for protection. A sea of green plants — including Oxalis triangularis and maranta lemon lime prayer plants, Alocasia ‘Silver Dragon’ and Hoya engleriana — is spread across three large wooden tables made by local artisan Sarven Manguiat. A progress Pride flag hangs on the front door, and a large mural on the back wall reads “Para Todxs Sale el Sol” — the sun comes out for everyone.
Compared with other minimal and pricey plant boutiques in town, Plantiitas seems to say, “Yes, you can breathe near the plants.” But it also says, “Come as you are.” Alcaraz, a freelance makeup artist, immigrated to this country from Mexico when he was 18. Diaz, the founder of an ASL interpreting service, is first-generation Mexican American. “I wanted to have something that said, ‘They are not ashamed to be brown,’” Alcaraz, 27, says. “Also I want it to be a place where people feel safe.”
Their approach has been transformative. The couple’s plant shop has had long lines since it opened last fall. So much so that their neighbors sometimes joke that they must be selling something harder than pothos. “For us to describe the feeling of love and support and just warmth that we’ve received ... it’s been mind-blowing,” Diaz, 31, says. “It’s been overwhelming.”
‘God is our permit’
Alcaraz is the visionary in the relationship, Diaz is the practical one. The couple met at a gym in Huntington Park and have been married for five years. Opening a plant shop is not something they had planned — or even thought possible — before last year.
“Black- and brown-owned plant businesses,” Diaz says, “there aren’t a whole lot.”
Plantiitas started with a one-off post on Facebook. Alcaraz had a couple of houseplants that were thriving, so he repotted them and put them in a macramé hanger he made in quarantine. He posted an image of the plants early in the pandemic, and they sold immediately. Then he began posting and selling more plants, eventually saving up $1,000. Alcaraz took that money and bought a truckload of plants and pots that he planned to sell on two tables and a rack outside his and Diaz’s garage.
“I said to Anthony, ‘We’re going to sell everything or we’re going to have a jungle.’”
They advertised the sale on social media for a Saturday last May. Within one day, every plant was sold.
Both Diaz and Alcaraz’s jobs had dried up because of COVID, so they began focusing on their new venture full time. They grew it from a couple of tables outside to a garage filled with greenery and open for business every Saturday and Sunday. Swarms of masked people, newly obsessed with plants during the pandemic, were showing up — and demand only grew.
“It got to the point where we had people lining up along our driveway just to get to our garage,” Diaz says.
There were also a few naysayers.
“We had some Karens coming and asking [as they were buying plants], ‘Do you have permits to do this?’” Alcaraz remembers, “and I was like, ‘We do. God is our permit.’”
Before long, though, Alcaraz and Diaz knew it was time to look for an official space. Somewhere they could stretch out and not have to worry about the city busting them — or violating social distancing guidelines. Besides, they were over the struggle of lugging their supply from their third-floor apartment to their first-floor garage every weekend.
Plantiitas’ home on a sleepy stretch of 4th Street was the first storefront they applied for.
In a subconscious way, the couple had been preparing for this moment their entire lives. Diaz grew up in Southeast L.A., tending to his grandparents’ garden. Alcaraz was born and raised in a small town in Jalisco, Mexico, called Margaritas (“small town, big chisme,” he jokes), where his family owned orchards and his grandmother helped cultivate his green thumb by talking to her plants every morning.
But being business owners of color working in the plant world brought with it a specific set of challenges. They didn’t have immediate access to capital. They didn’t have the “linguistic knowledge of what a business is and how to set it up,” Diaz says. Basics, like “not knowing the idea of purchasing as a company versus purchasing as a customer. All of those things are things that nobody lays out for you.
“The other stores aren’t going to want to share those secrets with you. I can’t tell you how many hours Kevin invested driving to different greenhouses to just show up, to ask questions, to feel powerless and hopeless until things started falling into place.”
These hurdles frustrated Diaz and Alcaraz but made them even more dedicated to operating a shop that is of the Long Beach community and for the Long Beach community. That meant centering the shop in the experiences of Long Beach’s queer and Latinx population.
For Diaz, that means prioritizing the mental health of people of color.
Early on in the pandemic, when he was struggling with anxiety, depression and PTSD, he turned to plants. They became a lesson in self-care. Plants needed water and so did he. Plants needed sun and so did he. The plants needed to be treated kindly and so did he.
Diaz thinks Plantiitas can offer the same for others — not only by selling plants but by hosting community healing events.
Prices are affordable. Small common plants in the shop start at $3, while the rare niche ones can sell for up to $300. But a solid chunk of them range between $10 and $30.
“I came with probably $100 to this country, so I had to work really hard to buy some things,” Alcaraz says. “I didn’t want people to be like I was going to a store and just checking everything out and saying, ‘One day.’ No. The day they come is the day I want them to take something home.”
Working with local artists is another important part of the equation. The mural that has become synonymous with Plantiitas is a remixed take on La Catrina, a Mexican symbol tied to Día de Muertos. It was painted by Long Beach artist Karina Vazquez, who was born in Guadalajara.
“Seeing how much they were doing with what they had, I really admired them for that,” Vazquez says about working with the couple. “And also knowing that they’re Mexican, I was like, ‘My people.’”
The feminine image Vazquez painted features a thin handlebar mustache in a nod to queerness, with a sun behind the figure’s head and vines for arms, intended to welcome all people into the space.
It’s working. One Plantiitas customer, Amanda Demaray, 31, says she comes to the shop weekly and has done so since it opened in October.
“The whole vibe is just … ,” says Demaray, lifting her hands to the sky, gesturing at some intangible energy. “I like to come when I’m not in the best mood, and it totally changes my day.”"

Black, Latinx and female entrepreneurs are still ignored by most venture capitalists
BY RONALD D. WHITE

As voices of protest rang out during the pandemic year, Jorge Rios had a front row.
The former high school teacher from Mexico wasn’t just watching crowds massing in the U.S. and elsewhere over George Floyd’s murder, Black Lives Matter, anti-government sentiment and other issues. Rios was monitoring rows of computer equipment and hearing his chief technology officer shouting things like: “We’re blowing up in Myanmar. We need more servers.”
Rios created a messaging app called Bridgefy, an encrypted communications platform that relies primarily on Bluetooth and mesh networks, not the internet. In one 48-hour period of protests over the Myanmar coup, Rios said, the app was downloaded 1 million times.
But Bridgefy almost didn’t happen. Rios approached multiple venture capitalists seeking development money. His app had been built for low-income people who lacked an internet connection. The funding people weren’t interested.
“We had a hard time finding a venture fund that understood us and our mission,” Rios said. “We would hear: ‘How is this a problem? Everyone has internet.’ They just didn’t get it, didn’t consider poor people. We were constantly going through emergencies in Mexico, during earthquakes, concerts and large events, losing communications. We had a solution, but no funding.”
Ultimately, Rios’ eight-employee firm got the seed money it needed from Mac Venture Capital, a predominantly Black firm trying to help level the venture funding playing field. The Los Angeles operation is one of several relatively new venture capital players — people of color interested in improving diversity in the founders they fund and the markets those firms hope to target.
For Rios, Mac Venture was the choir he didn’t have to preach to. “They understood immediately what we were trying to do,” Rios said.
Rios’ company is an example of what has and hasn’t changed in the venture capital world.
Bridgefy, which maintains offices in Mexico and San Francisco, received backing after years of trying. But for many entrepreneurs of color and women of all races, venture funding remains a mostly impenetrable barrier to success.
Venture funding is a major gateway to entrepreneurship, particularly in technology. It is an important catalyst for the development of new technology companies, the nurturing of big ideas and the start of new technologies and services.
For many business founders and women of color, it’s still a closed door, experts said.
“The disparity in who the venture capitalists are and where their money goes is just phenomenal,” said Katherine Klein, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.
Klein cited a diversity study by review platform RateMyInvestor.com that examined the records of 135 of the largest venture capital firms. The review website found that from 2013 through 2017, women led just 9.2% of the startups that got money. Less than 2% had a Latino founder, and 1% was led by a Black person.
The funding level hasn’t improved since then, recent data from Crunchbase indicate.
Black-owned U.S. companies received $1 billion in venture funding during 2020, - and Latino-owned U.S. companies received $2.7 billion — just 0.6% and 1.7%, respectively, of a total pool of $161.4 billion.
This year, from January through May 19, Black business founders surpassed the amount of venture funding they received during all of the previous year, with $1.6 billion, Crunchbase said. Still, it represented a tiny portion of overall venture funding over the same period, at 1.4% out of $110.4 billion.
Latino business founders’ share of venture funding has slipped in 2021, at $1.7 billion, or 1.5% of overall venture funding during the period.
“One of the things that we have begun to see, with the Black Lives Matter movement, was more investor interest, suddenly, in backing black founders in particular,” said Marlize van Romburgh, editor in chief of Crunchbase News.
“It’s a little too early to tell if that’s a long-term phenomenon that really moves the needle in any meaningful way. Because we’ve seen some years where that seems to increase, but isn’t really rising to any significant proportion that would represent the U.S. population overall,” she said.
To attribute the funding gap to overt discrimination would be too simplistic, experts and entrepreneurs said.
There is a fundamental disconnect in communication and understanding, they said. The predominantly white male investors fail to grasp who founders like Rios are and the value of the markets those entrepreneurs want to target.
“We always say internally that talent is ubiquitous, but access to opportunity and capital is not,” said Marlon Nichols, one of two co-managing general partners for Mac Venture Capital. “We’re set on being change agents that provide capital opportunities to very talented, qualified and driven entrepreneurs that are building solutions for challenges that we care about, and a lot of those challenges are going to be related to underserved communities.”
Mac Venture, formed in 2019 through the merger of two smaller funds, raised $110 million for its inaugural fund. Very few Black-owned venture capital firms top $100 million in funding.
Among the largest Black-led venture capital firms is Los Angeles-based Sinai Capital Partners, which took a huge leap last year by raising $600 million to invest in tech, media and entertainment efforts, bringing total assets under management to $800 million.
San Francisco-based Base10 Partners nearly tripled its size last year by raising $250 million for a new fund. Founder Adeyemi Ajao told Bloomberg that the fund was a response to the racial reckoning heightened by Floyd’s murder. The firm gives a portion of fees and profits to historically Black colleges and universities and to groups improving tech diversity.
Los Angeles-based Backstage Capital recently crowdfunded more than $1 million on private investing platform Republic to back firms led by people of color, women and LBGTQ individuals, according to TechCrunch.
The last year of upheaval has prompted some mainstream venture firms to examine their practices and records.
Among them is well-known funder Andreessen Horowitz, which highlights its long history of diverse hiring and investing on its website.
The firm already had the Cultural Leadership Fund, formed with money from Black cultural leaders largely in entertainment, media and sports, including Shonda Rhimes, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Kevin Durant. The fund donates some of its fees and profits to nonprofits improving technology diversity but has taken some heat for backing only a few Black startups.
In June 2020, Andreessen Horowitz unveiled the Talent x Opportunity fund, led by partner Nait Jones, for entrepreneurs from underserved communities “who have the talent, drive and ideas to build great businesses but lack the typical background and resources to do so.”
The fund started with $2.2 million from Andreessen Horowitz partners and a solicitation for funding from others, who get tax benefits. Company co-founder Ben Horowitz and his wife, Felicia, have pledged to match up to an additional $5 million raised.
Felix Orwa and Meka Este-McDonald are the kind of entrepreneur Mac Venture looks for. The two run a company called Sote, based in Oakland, and they want it to streamline cargo movement in Africa, one seaport at a time.
“We often felt that Africa, with all of its resources, should be the breadbasket of the world,” Este-McDonald said, “and yet it still imports food, which is just completely backward.
“One of the root cause problems is logistics, and the tremendous amount of friction that exists in moving goods between African countries and to and from the continent in general. We felt that the best way to be involved, touching all of the pieces of trade, was to create be a digital clearance and forwarding company,” he said.
Orwa, who is chief executive, and Este-McDonald, chief product officer, had plans that were continent sized, but often the pair didn’t get far enough along in meetings with investors to tell how they planned to succeed. Africa just wasn’t a continent funders were interested in.
“Almost universally, people would say things like: ‘I don’t even know a single person who would invest in Africa. I don’t even know people who would take this meeting,’” Este-McDonald said.
When Sote approached Mac Venture last summer, the response was quick. Mac Venture led Sote’s seed funding with $1 million.
“To have an entire partnership group who was comfortable with Africa was a night-and-day feeling,” Este-McDonald said. “We were hearing actual startup-type questions, like ‘What are you going to do with the money?’ They were open to our ideas.”
Lori Shao was another entrepreneur who couldn’t find venture funding for her Los Angeles startup, Finli, which she hoped would free up daycare operators, martial arts establishments, tutors, afterschool programs and the like from the drudgery of paperwork.
“Like any service business with an education and enrichment angle, these small businesses always struggle to figure out who’s supposed to pay them, how much, when and on whose behalf,” Shao said.
“They fail because they can’t grow. They can’t grow because they don’t have the time to go out and get new customers,” she said. “But they can outsource their entire back office to us. We handle everything the scheduling, the booking, the payments, so they can build up their customer base and focus on teaching.”
But before Shao could explain how she would accomplish this in a business plan, she was always stopped short; why did she want to work with a customer base like this, investors asked.
“Many times, investors have told me, ‘Why bother with first-generation and low-income businesses?’” Shao said. “‘Why don’t you guys go up market? It’s the same technology anyway. You can go to the affluent communities. You can do all of those things, and you can get better traction.’”
When Shao said she wouldn’t make that change, the rejections came.
“I literally had email after email from venture capitalists who say they support equality and uplifting and this and that. And they’re telling me, ‘Hey, we don’t feel comfortable about your space.’ Our space is exactly who they say they support, but I guess not,” Shao said.
Mac Venture provided Finli with $1 million of its initial round of $3.5 million of investment, the most it received from any single source. “It was a huge milestone for us,” Shao said.
In addition to Nichols, Mac Venture’s other managing partner is Adrian Fenty, a former District of Columbia mayor and special advisor to Andreessen Horowitz. The Mac Venture team also includes general partner Charles D. King, who was the first Black partner at the William Morris Endeavor media and talent agency, and venture capitalist Michael Palank, who worked with King at William Morris. King and Fenty met when they were in law school.
Mac Venture’s $110-million inaugural seed fund in the context of venture capital overall is relatively small, said Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at Kapor Capital, the venture capital investment arm of Oakland-based Kapor Center for Social Impact, itself a large investor in diverse founders.
“But to have a seed-stage or early-stage fund of $110 million run mostly by Black men is huge, and what it points to is the enormous gap and disparity in venture funding,” she said.
Bridgefy founder Rios said the company is looking to build its revenue stream now that it uses encrypted technology, which opens up opportunities for mobile payments, for instance.
Rios, who now lives in Florida, said Mac Venture “was the only fund that we found that was willing to make a significant investment into a problem that the majority of the First World ignores.”"

Commentary: ‘In the Heights’ should not be our only shot at a Latinx blockbuster
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

If movie theaters are to bounce back after the pandemic, Hollywood will have to rely on a loyal audience it has long neglected: Latinxs.
The COVID-19 shutdown was brutal for the film industry. According to a report by the Motion Picture Assn., box office sales in the United States and Canada dropped by 80% in 2020. Studios postponed movie premieres by more than a year or released them on streaming platforms.
But now there’s a vaccine, and with mass inoculation comes the hope that audiences will return to their local cineplexes. Luckily for the industry, Latinxs can save the day.
You see, we love going to the movies. In 2019, we bought a quarter of all tickets despite accounting for only 18% of the U.S. population. Latinxs went to the cinema an average of 4.7 times that year, the highest per capita attendance of any ethnic or racial group. In comparison, white moviegoers averaged 3.2 visits.
2021’s numbers might not look all that different.
The summer movie season has just begun, and Latinxs are already showing up. Warner Bros.’ “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” took the No. 1 spot at the box office last weekend, earning an estimated $24 million despite also premiering on HBO Max. According to Deadline, the paranormal flick performed best in Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, Houston and Chicago — all markets with significant Latinx populations. The film’s top grossing theater? The Cinemark Tinseltown in El Paso.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that the most successful opening weekend in the Conjuring Cinematic Universe — there are eight films in total — came in 2018 with the release of “The Nun.” It earned $53.5 million domestically, and Latinxs made up 36% of its audience. Perhaps not surprisingly, it’s the only film in the franchise to prominently feature a Latinx character (Mexican actor Demián Bichir as a priest).
And then there’s “In the Heights.”
The cinematic adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical set in the predominantly Latinx New York City neighborhood of Washington Heights is the biggest film to center our community since Pixar’s 2017 animated feature “Coco,” a two-time Oscar winner. Given that “In the Heights” features just about every actor with a Spanish surname not named Edward James Olmos, there is a high expectation that Friday’s release will end up being a watershed moment for Latinx representation on the big screen.
“We haven’t had a movie that feels like ‘Black Panther’ or ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’” lead actor Anthony Ramos recently told the Hollywood Reporter, referencing two movies that proved you could make a lot of money by telling Black and AAPI stories, respectively.
Ramos also noted that cast members would begin filming each day with rallying cries like “For la raza!” or “For the culture!,” a tacit acknowledgment that there’s a lot at stake in how “In the Heights” performs at the box office.
It’s hard to blame him for thinking that way. I’m not sure who decided that “In the Heights” needed to be the Latinx “Black Panther” or “Crazy Rich Asians,” but the discourse around the musical certainly feels like it’s our only shot at getting more of our stories on-screen.
It’s no surprise then that the National Assn. of Latino Independent Producers has teamed with Gold House, the Asian and Pacific Islander organization that organized a successful theater buyout campaign ahead of the 2018 premiere of “Crazy Rich Asians,” to launch a similar effort in support of “In the Heights” called #LatinxGoldOpen.
“Partnerships like this one are a substantive way to send the message that we see and support one another’s communities,” actor Daniel Dae Kim told the Hollywood Reporter.
“From our halmeonis to our abuelas, and our many languages from many countries, we hope to create a fuller, more complete narrative of what it means to be American.”
It’s definitely a noble effort, and I hope it succeeds. But even if “In the Heights” falls a dollar short of the studio’s projections, the truth is that Latinxs don’t need to prove to Hollywood that we can carry a big budget movie to the top of the box office. We’ve been doing it for two decades.
When “The Fast and the Furious” was released in 2001, nobody expected a $38-million action flick set in Los Angeles’ street racing scene to turn into a franchise that’s earned $6.15 billion to date over the course of 10 movies.
From the start, Latinxs have been one of the key drivers of this wild ride. When “Furious 7” premiered in 2015, we made up 37% of the opening weekend audience. When “The Fate of the Furious” premiered two years later, Latinxs bought 26% of all tickets on opening weekend.
In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Latinxs would be drawn to these movies. With the exception of 2006’s “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift” (the third one) and the 2019 spinoff “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,” every movie has featured prominent cultural signifiers of Latinidad. With the setting (Los Angeles, Miami, the U.S./Mexico border, the Dominican_Republic, Cuba), the cast (Michelle Rodriguez, Eva Mendes, Tego Calderón, Don Omar), the theme of family and even its frequent reggaeton beats, the franchise has woven Latinx culture into the films. Without revealing any spoilers, I can confirm that “F9” does the same thing.
This strategy has been by design. In 2009, after the release of “Fast & Furious” (the fourth one), a Universal executive told my colleague Reed Johnson that the studio intended to take care of the demographic group that had always “taken care of the franchise.”
It was this installment of the franchise that film historian Mary Beltrán called “a case study of Latinization of a mainstream film.”
“It is not surprising that a film franchise that has built one of its greatest appeals on its embodiment of cultural mingling and border crossing has expanded that vision to embrace the Latino diaspora within and outside the United States,” she wrote in 2013.
Universal Studios knows who has been fueling the engine of this franchise. It’s the reason why “F9’s” Vin Diesel and John Cena recently did an in-game promotion for the movie during the second leg of the Liga MX final. The Mexican professional soccer league is the most watched in the United States. That match, which was broadcast in Spanish by Univision, was seen by 3 million Latinxs.
“F9” is going to be a massive hit when it premieres in the United States on June 25. It’s already made $255 million in Asia and parts of the Middle East since opening there in mid-May. When it does, you better believe there’s going to be a story or two about how Latinxs supported the movie. We will have done our part.
Now it’s time for Hollywood to do theirs."

‘We fell short’: Lin-Manuel Miranda is sorry for ‘In the Heights’ Afro-Latinx erasure
BY RUTH ETIESIT SAMUEL

Lin-Manuel Miranda, who conceived and wrote the music and lyrics for the stage hit “In the Heights,” apologized Monday for the lack of Afro-Latinx representation in the film adaptation, directed by John M. Chu.
“I can hear the hurt and frustration over colorism, of feeling still unseen in the feedback,” Miranda wrote on social media, saying that he’d seen the discussion happening around the movie. “I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy.
“In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short,” he wrote. “I’m truly sorry.”
Miranda noted that while he had “incredible pride” in the movie, in which he’s cast in a small role, he also wanted to hold himself accountable for shortcomings.
“I’m dedicated to the learning and evolving we all have to do to make sure we are honoring our diverse and vibrant community,” the “Hamilton” musical creator said.
Set in New York’s Washington Heights, home to the Little Dominican_Republic neighborhood in Upper Manhattan, the movie “In the Heights” follows three days in the life of Usnavi de la Vega (Anthony Ramos) and his neighbors.
While audiences were dazzled by the salsa, merengue, and hip-hop dance numbers in the film, which was released in theaters and on HBO Max last week, some were simultaneously angered and dismayed by its minimal Afro-Latinx and LGBTQ+ representation.
On the surface, the movie is championed by Chu, a groundbreaking director of color. The screenplay is by Quiara Alegría Hudes, who wrote the book for the stage musical.
Miranda said Monday in his apology, “Over the past 20 years, all I wanted was for us — ALL of us — to feel seen....I’m truly sorry. I’m learning from the feedback, I thank you for raising it, and I’m listening.” But it may have come too late, as folks on social media were very clear in their criticisms.
“Anything about the Washington Heights community at large that don’t specifically center Black Dominicans (not just any Latinos — Black DOMINICANS),” said one user, “is a trash ass whitewashed fantasy.”
Carmen Phillips, Editor in Chief of Autostraddle, said, “By relegating Daniela and Carla to background sweetness, In the Heights asks queer Latinxs to settle...it asks Afro-Latinxs to settle. We are worth more than settling.”
In an interview last week with the Root, video producer Felice Léon, a Black woman of Cuban descent and a New York City native, probed Chu about the lack of Afro-Latinx representation. “Most of your principal actors were light-skinned or white-passing Latinx people,” Léon said. “With that, what are your thoughts on the lack of Black Latinx people represented in your film?”
""[W]e tried to get the people who were best for those roles, specifically,” Chu responded.
Soon after, “In the Heights” actress Melissa Barrera added in the interview that a lot of darker-skinned Afro-Latinos were a part of the audition process — but the directors wanted “the right people for the roles.”
She referred to Washington Heights as “a melting pot,” yet the one Black main character, Benny (Corey Hawkins), is not of Latinx descent. Castmate Leslie Grace, who identifies as Afro-Latina, said that upon reflection she realized that she didn’t often get to see people who looked like her darker-skinned siblings on screen.
Chu asked, “Did you not see that in the dancers?,” to which Léon replied that Black actors have often been relegated to the background. Colorism extends across racial and international lines in acting, leaving darker-skinned actors wondering if proximity to whiteness is the only way to enter the proverbial room where it happens.
Twitter users recalled that Chu fumbled South Asian representation in “Crazy Rich Asians,” demoting those actors to stereotypical domestic work roles while East Asians were the faces of opulence — which he told Insider he now regrets. However, per the Root, Chu said the lack of darker-skinned, Black Latinx people was something he admittedly “needed to be educated about” and “we should all be talking about.”
Apart from the colorism, audiences also critiqued the movie’s vague framing of same-sex couple Daniela (Daphne Rubin-Vega) and Carla (Stephanie Beatriz), saying the two were unrecognizable as romantic partners to viewers who were not a part of the LGBTQ+ community. Some desired more on-screen public displays of of affection, citing it as a missed opportunity to address and combat homophobia in Latinx communities.
Chu told the Root that while “we tried our best on all fronts,” he hopes more people feel encouraged to “tell more stories and go out there and do it right.”
One Twitter user noted that “Heights” carries an “unfair burden” to get it right; another stated that such excuses are weaponized by white people and do not absolve people of color in power of their responsibility.
“In the Heights” premiered in theaters Friday. Though the Broadway musical was a four-time Tony award-winning production, the movie adaptation took in a mere $11.4 million in its opening weekend, which points to what one media analyst called musicals’ “mixed track record at the box office.”"

‘In the Heights’ and the pitfalls of Latinx representation
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Last Friday’s premiere of “In the Heights” was supposed to be a watershed moment for Latinx representation in Hollywood. The adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical was being characterized as the Latinx “Black Panther” or “Crazy Rich Asians,” a big-budget movie that would prove once and for all that there is money to be made in telling our stories.
By Monday, the conversation around “In the Heights” had drastically shifted thanks to a video interview produced by the Root in which reporter Felice León asks the movie’s director and cast why there were so few Afro Latinx characters when the neighborhood it purports to represent is predominantly Afro Latinx. The video went viral, sparking accusations that the movie was yet another example of the colorism that exists within the Latinx community. The backlash was severe enough that Miranda issued an apology and promised to do better.
“I can hear the hurt and frustration over colorism, of feeling still unseen in the feedback,” he wrote on social media. “I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy.
“In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short,” he wrote. “I’m truly sorry.”
It’s easy to say this with the benefit of hindsight, but “In the Heights” was never going to live up to its expectations. Framing a work of art as the Latinx anything is a doomed endeavor from the start. The biggest misconception people have about Latinidad — including many who claim it — is that there is one singular experience. No work of art, no matter how well-intentioned, will ever truly represent the totality of a group of 60 million people.
In truth, Latinxs will never achieve equitable representation until Hollywood starts telling enough of our stories that they become commonplace. And yes, that includes movies and TV shows that center Afro Latinxs, who despite largely being excluded from our screens make up 25% of the total U.S. Latinx population.
It’s a reality that actor Gina Torres seems to understand. Torres, whose parents are Cuban immigrants, has spent much of her career “hiding in plain sight” playing non-Latinx Black roles because she didn’t fit the conventional idea of what a Latinx looks like. She told CNN this was why it was so important that when she was offered the female lead role in “9-1-1: Lone Star,” she asked for her character to be explicitly Afro Latinx.
“I need to speak my language [Spanish] whenever possible,” Torres said. “I need to let the audience know that this is also a face of Latinidad.”"

More Latinx families are raising their voices against police brutality
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

On the night of June 2, 2020, Sean Monterrosa was shot and killed in the parking lot of a Walgreens in Vallejo, Calif., a city just north of San Francisco. Police say they mistook a hammer — Monterrosa was a cement mason and was learning carpentry — for a gun.
It’s been more than a year since the death of Monterrosa, and his two sisters Ashley and Michelle have spent much of that time demanding answers. Their ongoing fight was the subject of a story written by CNN’s Nicole Chavez that took a broader look at how police brutality affects the Latinx community.
According to the Washington Post’s Fatal Force database, 1,061 Latinx people have been shot and killed by police since 2015. Since 2018, 67% of all people shot and killed by the Los Angeles Police Department were Latinx, a disproportionately high figure given that Latinxs make up just about half of L.A. County’s total population.
“We want justice for Sean, and we want that justice to mean that this can’t happen to anyone anywhere else,” said Ashley Monterrosa at a news conference outside San Francisco’s City Hall.
“And best believe we’re pushing to be the last family affected by the Vallejo Police Department.”
Beyond just protesting, the sisters have been applying pressure on the legislative front, including testifying in favor of California’s proposed SB 2, which would make it easier to decertify officers who commit serious misconduct. (Anita Chabria, who covers California state politics for The Times, has this breakdown of SB 2 and the challenges the bill faces.)
“We can always hit the streets … we can protest but it’s meaningless if we’re not working on anything on the back end to hold people in office accountable,” Ashley Monterrosa told CNN.
The Monterrosa sisters are the latest example of young Latinxs speaking out against police brutality. My colleague Brittny Mejia wrote about this very subject last year after the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd. It’s a promising trend, one that gives me hope that true police reform and accountability might one day become a reality.
But we are not there. This isn’t the first time I’ve written about police brutality in this space and it certainly won’t be the last. There is more work to be done. Thankfully, people like the Monterrosa sisters are stepping up to the challenge."

‘Forget the Alamo’ and the difficulties in talking about this country’s complicated history
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Chris Tomlinson was driving to Austin when his phone rang.
The Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News columnist was on his way to the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum to promote “Forget the Alamo: The Rise and Fall of an American Myth,” a book co-written with Bryan Burrough and Jason Stanford that talks about the foundational role that slavery has in Texas history and the institutional efforts to whitewash that truth. You can read The Times’ review here.
Less than four hours before Thursday’s event was supposed to start, Burrough was calling to tell him the museum was pulling out. According to Penguin Press, their publisher, the museum had been “receiving increased pressure on social media about hosting the event.”
“We pretty much understood immediately that this was a political action by a state institution shutting down our ability to speak to an audience,” Tomlinson said.
The following day, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who sits on the State Preservation Board alongside Gov. Greg Abbott, took credit for the cancellation on Twitter.
That Patrick boasted of shutting down the book event isn’t surprising. He and Abbott have been staunch opponents of the notion that race and slavery are key components in an honest telling of U.S. history. In June, Abbott established “The 1836 Project,” an advisory committee aimed at promoting “patriotic education” (the committee’s name is an obvious play on the New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize-winning series “The 1619 Project”).
I spoke with Tomlinson on Saturday, two days after his Twitter thread on what happened went viral. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
You mention in the introduction of “Forget the Alamo” that you “stand on the shoulders of revisionist authors” whose work challenged the prevalent narrative of Texas history. Why, then, has there been backlash to your book and to the canceled event at the Bullock Texas State History Museum?
I just want to be clear, there is nothing original in our book prior to the reporting we’ve done over the last two years. Everything we wrote about prior to 2019 had already been covered by professional historians, and we have ample endnotes to support all of our assertions about the role slavery played in the revolution and how many of the myths around the Alamo are just not true.
I think Dan Patrick and the right wing saw an opportunity to use state power to censor a group of authors whose work the Texas Public Policy Foundation claims is the Texas version of “The 1619 Project,” and I could not be more flattered by the comparison. But if that is their presumption, then it follows that they will use state power to shut us down because that is their political campaign platform at this point. We’re caught up in the debate over the teaching of racism in this country and the teaching of current events. But at the end of the day, this is a violation of our 1st Amendment rights. It is the state practicing prior restraint on our speech, and therefore it’s censorship and it’s illegal.
Are you guys considering taking legal action?
We have asked the museum to invite us back and to reinstate the original event as it was planned. And if they fail to do so, then all of our options are open and legal action is part of it.
The controversy has no doubt resulted in unexpected publicity for the book. Have you seen an uptick in sales?
We don’t have any solid sales numbers, but we have been tracking our rankings on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Prior to this, we peaked at No. 168 on Amazon following Bryan’s appearance on “Fresh Air.” As of this afternoon, we are No. 24 [as of this writing, the book is No. 46]. Last week before all of this happened, we were in the thousands, so yes, we have skyrocketed up the ranks. The response among freedom of speech defenders has been fabulous. They’re buying our book, and they’ll hopefully share the message in our book, which is that the way most people learn Texas history today is wrong and it needs to be fixed.
I’m from Texas, which means I was required to take Texas history in the seventh grade. The role of slavery was not mentioned in our textbook. It wasn’t until college that I learned about it, along with the long history of state violence against Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Why is this historical fact such a difficult topic to discuss in the education system and in public forums?
The middle part of our book tracks how Texas exceptionalism was dictated by the state Legislature when it was setting curriculum standards. We look at the specific historians who drilled down this idea that white Texans were a superior breed and therefore deserving of power and authority over everyone else. This was a systematic indoctrination.
Many Texans today, if you’re over 50 years old like me, remember growing up with these white supremacist-tinged legends and being told that we are special because our ancestors were special. Too many people have tied up their personal identities with the stories of their ancestors and these legends. I grew up that way. Then I discovered that my grandfather was a Klansman, that my great-grandfather was a Klansman who bragged about lynching people. I learned the truth, and that was what my first book was about. I grew out of that. I can now be my own man without relying on my ancestry for self-respect. But sadly, many Texans still need that. And that’s why they’re so threatened.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t bring up that Texas is increasingly becoming more and more Latinx.
This book came out of a column I wrote about the need for San Antonio and Texas to change their image now that non-Hispanic Anglos make up only 41% of the population. In a few short years, maybe by 2025, Latinxs will be the majority in Texas, and these old stories and myths do not work for them.
We spoke to dozens of San Antonians of Mexican American descent who talked about how hurtful the legends of the Alamo are, how they were made to feel un-American in seventh grade because their ancestors killed Davy Crockett. It’s the equivalent of accusing Jews of being Christ killers. It is a harmful, hurtful message. And that’s one of the main reasons we wrote this book.
What are the larger implications of what’s happening in Texas in terms of the way that we talk about history?
The conservative backlash that we’re seeing from Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Patrick to critical race theory, which has led them to establish “The 1836 Project” to begin propagating patriotic education and banning books like ours, is just the beginning of what’s going to be a larger and more divisive battle. But, you know, I can’t see where the white supremacist myths can win with a much better informed, younger population that’s more diverse. I think we’re just at the beginning of a fight, but I think you can just look at the numbers on each side and you know who’s going to win."

3 L.A. artists are among the first winners of $5 million Latinx Artist Fellowship program
BY JESSICA GELT

Three L.A. artists are among 15 people receiving $50,000 each as the inaugural winners of the newly established Latinx Artist Fellowship, a program administered by the U.S. Latinx Art Forum with support from the Andrew W. Mellon and Ford foundations.
The program — the first of its kind on this financial scale — was established to address what the Latinx Art Forum has called a systemic lack of support for Latinx visual artists. Each year, for a period of five years, the fellowship will provide funds to the 15 artists with the goal of supporting emerging, midcareer and established artists in equal measure. The total funding for the multiyear initiative is $5 million.
According to the Latinx Art Forum, annual philanthropic funding for Latinx arts and culture endeavors dipped to $13 million in 2019, down from $39 million in 2013. During the pandemic, the need for additional support for the arts grew. The Latinx Artist Fellowship seeks to heighten the visibility and impact of Latinx visual artists by funding what it has identified as some of the most compelling Latinx artists working in America. Fellows were selected from more than 200 nominees by a jury of art historians, scholars and curators
The inaugural class of fellows includes artists from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as queer and gender nonconforming artists. They are: Elia Alba, Celia Álvarez Muñoz, Adriana Corral, Coco Fusco, Yolanda López, Miguel Luciano, Guadalupe Maravilla, Carlos Martiel, Michael Menchaca, Delilah Montoya, Vick Quezada, Juan Sánchez.
The list includes three artists who live and work in Los Angeles: Carolina Caycedo, rafa esparza and Christina Fernández.
Caycedo is a multidisciplinary artist who focuses on the environment and the impact, importance and scarcity of shared resources, particularly water. She was born to Colombian parents and has been shown at the Whitney, Venice, Havana and São Paulo art biennials, as well as in the Hammer Museum’s 2018 Made in L.A. biennial.
Esparza is a multidisciplinary and performance artist born and raised in Pasadena. His parents were immigrants from Durango, Mexico. Esparza is known for bringing outside elements, such as adobe bricks, inside museums, and for staging his performance practice on the streets of L.A., including in Santee Alley and in Chinatown.
Fernández is a photographer and associate professor and cochair of the photography department at Cerritos College in Norwalk. Her work is known for its social and political elements and is influenced by her Mexican heritage."

The protest in Cuba, and what happens next?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

It was all sparked by a power outage and decades of bottled-up frustration.
On Sunday morning, hundreds of residents of San Antonio de los Baños, a town outside Havana, took to the streets to decry the constant electricity shortages that have made a hot and humid Caribbean summer even worse. The protest was broadcast live on social media, and soon the cries of “No tenemos miedo!” spread throughout the island.
According to Periodismo del Barrio, an independent Cuban news outlet, more than 70 anti-government protests have been confirmed to date. These are the largest such demonstrations in Cuba since the Maleconazo, the 1994 uprising that took place during “el periodo especial,” in which Cubans faced years of famine and a crumbling economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Three decades later and amid a global pandemic, Cubans find themselves in a similar situation.
“Me fui a la calle porque estoy aburrida de pasar hambre, de pasar trabajo,” said Sara Naranjo in a video shared on Twitter. “No tengo agua, no tengo nada.”
One major difference between now and then is the arrival of the internet to the island. In December 2018, the Cuban government rolled out a 3G mobile network, connecting many residents for the first time ever. That same network is what helped spread the protests across Cuba. It’s no surprise that the government blocked access on Monday.
“Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet, we are unarmed,” Gino Ocumares of Havana told Reuters. “The government does not want people to see the truth.”
But by then it was too late. Though there has been an intermittent internet blackout in Cuba since Monday, videos of the protests and the ensuing state violence and police brutality — one person has been confirmed dead — had already been shared across the globe.
It’s unclear what will happen next, but it’s hard not to feel as though we’re on the cusp of witnessing history.
“I think the Communists have lost control, they won’t have a solution to this situation,” Waldo Herrera, a Havana resident, said. “The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression.”
Now we all wait. The Cuban people aren’t going to simply go back to their day-to-day life of trying to “resolver” for their basic needs. And the government shows no signs of backing down. There is desperation on both sides, and that doesn’t bode well for the next couple of weeks."

The DACA ruling’s real-world implications
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is illegal and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop processing new applications. My colleague Justin Ray has a breakdown of the decision in today’s Essential California newsletter, which you can read here.
But what does this mean for those whose livelihoods are at stake?
“It’s a lot to take in,” said Brian De Los Santos, editor of LAist and a DACA recipient. “My initial reaction was to remind myself that I’ve been here before and that I’m going to figure it out.”
In October 2017, President Trump tried to end the program but was eventually overruled by the Supreme Court. At that time, De Los Santos was working for the Los Angeles Times and wrote about the uncertainty he felt then. He’s feeling it yet again.
“I’m going to power through this, but it’s taxing. Our mental health is affected every time politicians or the courts make decisions for us,” he said.
When I asked what he does to keep any mental health issue in check, De Los Santos said he tries to parse what is out of his hands and what he can control.
“I tell myself, ‘OK, Brian, this is what you’re going to do and you’re not going to worry about this for now.’ Taking it step by step, that’s where I’ve been able to feel some sort of calmness through this storm.”
Agueda Pacheco, a 25-year-old writer and former journalist from Seattle, said her initial reaction when finding out the news was a sense of exhaustion.
“It’s a combination of being tired, of being overwhelmed and underwhelmed. It’s hard to fully enjoy your life.”
Pacheco is currently in Mexico as part of a study-abroad program through the California-Mexico Studies Center. She and hundreds of others were granted advance parole, which allows them to travel abroad.
She spoke fondly of her experience during our Zoom conversation, though she was quick to point out that being in Mexico was also a reminder of what the future could hold for her.
“Let’s say they take away the DACA program and I get deported back to Mexico,” Pacheco posited. “I’ve been here for a couple months, and I know that it would just be a grind — it would be like immigrating all over again. It just doesn’t feel like I have any solid ground on either side.”
It’s been nearly a decade since President Obama set up the DACA program. In that time, politicians on both sides have come out in support of granting “Dreamers” some form of legal protections through legislation. Democrats have led on the issue, and then-President Trump moved to end the program.
Yet here we are, two administrations later, and nothing has been done. The political inaction has meant loss of jobs, family separation and a life in limbo. It has meant planning a life two years at a time with uncertainty and fear.
De Los Santos, Pacheco and the hundreds of thousands like them deserve better."

The return of Latina
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

In the early 1990s, while taking a business class at Stanford Law School, Christy Haubegger came up with a plan for a would-be magazine that would cater to Latinx women. Her professor liked the idea and told her it was viable.
Haubegger, who was born to a Mexican American mother and was adopted by white parents that encouraged her to get in touch with her heritage, didn’t act on the idea at first. It wasn’t until after she graduated that she really considered turning her proposal into a reality.
In June 1996, Latina published its first issue. It featured a story on the fashion of Miami’s Calle Ocho and tips on how to talk to your kids about racism.
“Jennifer Lopez was on the cover,” Haubegger said in a 1999 Los Angeles profile, recalling the first time she saw Latina on newsstands. “The magazine right next to it had Claudia Schiffer. And we looked just as good.”
(Haubegger would leave Latina in 2002 to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. She’s currently an executive at WarnerMedia.)
Latina was ubiquitous for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The magazine was available at your local grocery store and you’d regularly see it in doctor’s and dentist’s waiting rooms. Some of its early success could be attributed to doing something that’s taken media and advertisers decades to figure out: U.S.-born Latinxs speak and read English.
But then came the advent of the internet and a turn toward digital media consumption. The print world (including my own employer) were forced to adapt to this new reality. In 2018, the New York Post reported on Latina’s financial woes, which ultimately resulted in the company scrapping their print product altogether. It looked like the end for the pioneering publication.
But rather than folding, Latina went on hiatus to regroup and existed largely on its sizable social media platforms (as of this writing, its Instagram page had 475,000 followers and it has nearly 147,000 followers on Twitter). In October 2020, the company hired Camila Legaspi, a 25-year-old Mexican American woman born and raised in New York City, to be its chief content officer. In May, nearly 25 years after its first issue, Latina relaunched as a digital magazine, featuring Grammy-winning artist Kali Uchis on its cover.
A few weeks back, I jumped on a Zoom call with Legaspi to talk about the return of Latina and its plans for the future. The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.
Something that struck me as I was looking through Latina’s website is that it’s more than just lifestyle and beauty tips. It feels more inclusive. What was the impetus for this change in editorial direction?
Latina is such a revolutionary publication that has meant so much for many. But it’s hard to pretend that it didn’t constantly feature white or white-adjacent Latinos on the cover. Part of relaunching is knowing our past and wanting to fix that. Writing about and covering Latinos is such a challenge because we are not a monolith. There are so many stories to be told, and our goal is to put out as much of them as we can.
Before, we were very much a magazine for Latina women. We’ve reworked it to be a place for Latinos, regardless of how they identify. I’m 25 years old. My peers and I have grown up in a media landscape that has tried to be more inclusive and open, and that influences our approach. We really want to be a safe haven for everyone. We’ve had stories on our site that contributors said they’d pitched to other publications and were rejected because it might not have fit the conventional idea of what is considered a story for Latinos.
As you mentioned, Latinxs are not a monolith. How do you cover a community of nearly 60 million people that’s all over the place geographically?
We have people in those places. I’m based in New York and I grew up here. Our managing editor, Alissa Lopez Serfozo, is Mexican American as well and is based in L.A. Our editor at large, Verky Baldonado, is based in Miami.
It’s kind of the right time to be asked this question than a year ago because of remote work. We’re all working from home in three different locations, which allows us to stay plugged in. As we grow and expand, the hope is to find people in places like Texas and Chicago, which have big Latino populations. We are a small team and we just launched, but we’re always looking for more writers and freelancers.
You briefly touched on this generational shift that’s happening with the Latinx community. A 2016 Pew report said that millennials and younger generations accounted for 61% of the overall U.S. Latinx population. Something I’ve noticed as part of that change is a willingness and a desire to think critically of what “Latinidad” means or if it even exists. What are your thoughts on that?
I know for some people speaking on their Latinidad is kind of a sacred thing. For some, it’s a way to understand their relationship to their identity in the United States, seeing it as a common thread they have with others. But it’s also obvious that many people feel excluded from that conversation. We don’t really have any articles on our website that use Latinidad as a term or an idea meant to categorize everyone. We’ve had people bring it up because they feel strongly about it, but it’s always them telling us about it.
Even the term “Latinx,” as I’m sure you know, is being reassessed as to whether it’s the best term to describe our community. We recently interviewed Kablito, a musician who spoke about how she identifies as Latina because she doesn’t love “Latinx” because she felt it was a U.S.-created label.
One of the goals of Latina as a platform is to showcase the difference of opinion and conflicting views that exist, and that includes exploring how people grapple with these terms of identity.
What does success look like for Latina?
On a personal level, I want Latina to be one of the go-to places for Latinos to find stories about them. I want people to be able to call me up and say, “Hey, I saw that story on Latina because my friend shared it!” I feel like everyone has four or five publications or websites that they check regularly, and I want Latina to be one of them because I feel like I don’t have that.
Business-wise, our goal is to partner with brands that really align with our values and are behind our mission. We’re not going to be partnering up with companies that are just looking to check off the box of Latino representation. Our goal is to connect with sponsors and partners and brands that can sustain our model and that can assist in producing docu-series, interviews and really important stories that uplift our community. Having the brand power that Latina has behind us helps.
But it’s a tricky thing because also I think that when it comes to branded content and advertisers, people are tired. But that’s the reality of media. It’s unfortunate because print magazines were sustained through full-page advertisers. That doesn’t exist now. I think the way that we’re moving is to do these forms of branded content, but to do them in an authentic way.
Another way in which I hope Latina is successful is that we make a dent in the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood. I don’t have to tell you about it. You’ve written on the subject and have seen the numbers. My hope is that we can partner and co-produce content with Hollywood production companies. Our hope is to work towards changing that in the future."

What the U.S. census tells us about what’s ahead for Latinx community
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

The U.S. Census Bureau released its report for the 2020 count last Thursday, confirming what so many of us already knew: The country is becoming increasingly more urban and diverse.
The report also revealed that Latinxs now make up 18.7% of the total population —roughly 62.1 million people — an increase of 23% over the last 10 years. Similarly, more than half of the total national population growth in that same period was fueled by Latinxs.
Conversely, the U.S. white population shrank for the first time in census history. White people now make up 57.8% of this country, a decline of more than 5 million people over the last 10 years.
But what does this all mean?
On paper, the 2020 census report hints at the growing political power of Latinxs. (Insert waking a sleeping giant joke here).
One of the purposes of the count is to determine the number of congressional seats each state gets based on their population. The more people who live in a given state, the more U.S. House representatives it will have in Congress. It stands to reason that if Latinxs are a huge driver of growth across the country, then that will translate to more political representation for our community.
Let’s look at Texas as an example. Latinxs were responsible for one out of every two new residents added over the last 10 years and now account for 39.3% of the total population, nearly matching the number of non-Latinx white people (39.8%) who call the Lone Star State home. Because of this growth, Texas is gaining two congressional seats.
But we also live in a country where political gerrymandering is alive and well. The census only determines how many seats each state gets, not how those congressional districts are drawn. That is left to the states to decide, which means that it’ll be the GOP-controlled Texas state Legislature that will be drawing that map.
Texas Republicans were sued the last time they were in charge of redistricting in 2013. Opponents alleged they had been intentionally discriminated against in the drawing of political maps, but the Supreme Court disagreed. Because of that ruling, the same type of tricks are expected.
“Republicans are going to have to decide — very bluntly — how greedy they want to be,” Renée Cross, senior director of the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, told the Austin American-Stateman.
Of course, Latinxs are not a monolith (I know, I know, you’re probably tired of hearing this, but it doesn’t make it any less true). While Latinxs have historically voted for Democrats, the 2020 presidential election showed that demographics alone aren’t the panacea the party was hoping for. Despite his white nationalist rhetoric, Donald Trump actually made gains with Latinxs. And as my colleague Gustavo Arellano noted in a recent column, California Latinxs played a big role in getting Gov. Gavin Newsom elected in 2018 but might now be his downfall in the current recall election.
But the diversity in political beliefs among Latinxs notwithstanding, it doesn’t change the fact that this country is becoming more and more nonwhite as time goes on. And that has some people very worried.
“The passage of power is not a polite and gentle affair like passing the salt at a dinner table,” Charles M. Blow of the New York Times wrote in his column last week, aptly entitled “It Was a Terrifying Census for White Nationalists,” Blow notes that even before the Census report, efforts to disenfranchise communities of color through voter suppression are already well underway in states where the white stranglehold of power is under threat.
“People with power fight — sometimes to the end — to maintain it. There’s going to be a shift, but not without strife,” he wrote."

More than a ‘nameless maid’: A memoirist’s manifesto on Latinx colorism
BY JEAN GUERRERO

Growing up in Miami in a family of immigrants from Nicaragua, Prisca Dorcas Mojica Rodríguez sought role models in Spanish-language films and in telecasts on Univision and Telemundo. But none of the Latina anchors and lead actors looked like her. They looked European, light-skinned. The times she did see herself, it was in what she calls “the nameless maids” on the periphery.
These damaging cues weren’t confined to mass entertainment. A high school counselor tried to dissuade her from taking more advanced-placement classes; her graduate school’s English-proficient writing center rejected her because English was her second language.
Against those odds, Mojica Rodríguez obtained a master’s in divinity, launched a successful online conversation platform called Latina Rebels and became a prolific writer — in English. Now, she has written a self-described love letter to women of color.
Mojica Rodríguez’s electrifying debut, “For Brown Girls With Sharp Edges and Tender Hearts,” channels mesmeric prose to heal the wounds of white supremacy. A theologian, she deliberately uses the rhythm and cadence of a Pentecostal sermon.
“I cannot undo the fact that my skin glows from all this sunlight,” she writes. “Like magic, my skin turns sunrays into nutrients, into vitamin D.” She recalls painful moments on the road to self-acceptance, such as her mother telling her to stay out of the sun: “Te estás poniendo negra” (You’re turning Black).
“We somehow have allowed ourselves not only to internalize racism, but to become Brown white supremacists,” she observes in the book, emphasizing that she’s not criticizing her mother but rather the widespread “normalization of the supremacy of whiteness.”
“For Brown Girls” is more than a celebration of brownness at a vital moment, as political race-baiting continues to fuel hate crimes against people of color. It is also a manual for tapping into brown girls’ power to fight the ways white supremacy excludes and erases them.
“I hope it provides almost like a map as to what to anticipate and how to maneuver those spaces,” Mojica Rodríguez told me. “A playbook for how to survive.”
Reckoning not only with racism and colorism but also toxic masculinity, she calls on all Latinas to embrace the parts of ourselves we have long been taught to bury in shame. She spoke with The Times over the phone, in a conversation edited for clarity and length, about her book, a long-overdue corrective that should be required reading in many schools.
Since the Black Lives Matter protests in response to George Floyd’s murder, there has been an increase in Latinx Americans reckoning with our colorism and anti-Blackness. How did that conversation shape your book?
I was very aware that I’m writing about colorism as a non-Black person of color. I was trying to hold the tension of: “I have experienced colorism; I also have benefited from colorism.” I do hope that moving forward, it creates a better way for us to have those conversations. Latinxs who are lighter skinned have been generally more resistant to having those conversations. I kept rewriting that chapter [on colorism], trying to figure out how to be gentle to our people but also push us to be better. And I hope it’s the beginning of us being more transparent.
How are Latinos in positions of power failing our diverse communities?
The main failure is our lack of awareness of colorism. The lightest of us are usually the ones who end up with the opportunities first. The failure has been in not acknowledging that. And we are taught to overvalue whiteness even when there’s no white people around. The more we’re willing to be honest about the ways we’ve been harmed instead of trying to approximate ourselves to whiteness, the more we can do for our communities. I’m not prescriptive in ways a lot of [popular] anti-racism texts are. They center white people, and this book doesn’t do that at all. In unveiling all my scars in a way, I hope people are open to listening instead of rushing to defend whiteness as we’ve been taught to do.
What was the most challenging part of writing this book?
My imposter syndrome. I got over that by going on Amazon Books and seeing what these mediocre white men have been writing for years. I was like, “I got this. This is going to be OK.” I got past the hump of doubt by looking at others who had no doubt.
I did that too when writing my biography about Trump advisor Stephen Miller, and it helped a lot. Speaking of Trump, what are your thoughts on the increase in Latino support for Trump between 2016 and 2020?
My dad’s a Trump supporter and my brother is too. They’re visibly brown men who look indigenous and will go to a [resort at an Indian] reservation in Miami and be asked for drinks. It’s the delusion in certain bubbles like Miami, where you’re surrounded by people who might look like you — the delusion that you are just as white as other white people. It’s a very confused state of being. I think I experienced that too — all these microaggressions in white Latinx spaces — but I was unable to see it until I was around white-white people, and I was like, “Oh, this is bad.”
Why was it important for you to explore your father’s machismo in this book?
Machismo is seen as different than sexism. I’ve heard Latinas who specifically date white men: “White men are sexist but they’re at least not machistas.” I think it’s a missed analysis of oppression and the ways it has functioned in some very dramatic ways. [Many brown] men have been taught very linear ways of existing because of toxic masculinity, and some haven’t been able to shake that off because of oppression.
You write that brown girls’ fire comes from their mothers. I knew immediately what you meant. But can you elaborate on it?
[My mom] got married young because she had to, and she doesn’t have a college degree. I’ve always been very aware that my mom’s a feminist even if she doesn’t say it and even if she rebukes it. I think there’s fire in that, there’s power in that. She won’t even let me act like I might know a little more than her. She’s always fighting to have a place. She’s always fighting to exist. She’s always fighting to not be thought of as less than. Even as the walls were crumbling, she was constantly working to keep the walls up for herself and for everyone, and I think that’s what feminism is.
And yet she was the wife of a macho pastor, right?
She told him [off] at one point. He would bring people over all the time, and she’d have to serve everyone and be the doting wife. Then they’d leave, and she’d have to clean up and [stay up] late and he’d do nothing. So one day she made a clear declaration: “I don’t want to host anyone ever.” He brought people against her will, and she didn’t help at all, which meant her losing respect from congregants. But she was pataleando [Spanish for kicking or rebelling]. She was fighting always for some autonomy, and people need to understand that fire."

What to make of Hispanic Heritage Month?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Cynicism.
That’s the first word that pops into my head when I think of Hispanic/Latinx Month, which kicked off yesterday.
The origins of Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month date back to 1968, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill establishing the week containing Sept. 15 as Hispanic Heritage Week. Choosing that date was a symbolic one: It coincides with the independence days of El_Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa_Rica.
“The people of Hispanic descent are the heirs of missionaries, captains, soldiers, and farmers who were motivated by a young spirit of adventure, and a desire to settle freely in a free land,” wrote Johnson.
In 1988, with the help of one of my colleagues (more on that later), Ronald Reagan extended the observance to 30 days.
Since then, Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month has been largely co-opted and stripped of much of its meaning by corporate America. At some point, Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month became a period during which brands bombard you with campaigns acknowledging the existence of the Latinx consumer. It’s toymaker Mattel announcing the Celia Cruz and Julia Alvarez Barbie dolls. It’s the Broward County Government Facebook page posting (it’s now deleted) a dancing taco with maracas to celebrate the nearly one-third of the county that’s Latinx.
It’s NPR renaming its famed Tiny Desk Concert series as “El Tiny,” and it’s my employer sending out a press release announcing a partnership with Univision to air our “Fernandomania @ 40"" docuseries (which was proudly featured in this space).
That this tokenization — regardless of intent — is still happening in 2021, when Latinx people account for nearly 1 in 5 Americans, is disheartening.
So yeah, cynicism.
Of course, these are just the opinions of one person and by no means represent the totality of 60+ million Latinx people living in America. With that said, here’s what others make of Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month.
What do the youth think of Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month?
In preparation for this week’s newsletter, I reached out to three students at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to get their thoughts on Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month. Let me tell you, there is nothing more rewarding and enlightening than talking to the youth.
Here is how they responded:
“As far as Latino Heritage Month. Simply put, I don’t necessarily celebrate it. Every day for me is Latino Heritage Month because I live and breathe my identity of being a Latina and a woman of color. It goes far beyond just the month.” — Emily Bonilla, 21
”I do get excited because it’s a month where you just go hard. You’re like, ‘OK, I’m going to support all these Latinx businesses a little more today.’ There’s a fashion designer that I love [Paty Delgado], she has this fashion brand called Hija de tu Madre and I’m a big supporter. I’m going to use this month as an opportunity to buy even more from her shop and I’m going to repost and share her things so more people can love it. It’s a way for me to show my appreciation. It’s also a great time to teach people outside of the culture what we’re about and why it means so much to us.” — Marilyn Parra, 21
“I think for the most part, Latinx Heritage Month is full of misconceptions and stereotypes. People just assume everybody who is Latinx is Mexican. Obviously, that’s not the case. It’s a very American thing to do, to put a Band-Aid on and say, ‘Hey, we’re giving you an entire 30 days to celebrate. You can’t say that we didn’t do anything for you.’ Honestly, I just don’t think it’s enough.” — Chelsea Hylton, 22
How Hispanic Heritage Week became Hispanic Heritage Month
It’s difficult for me to be entirely cynical about Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month knowing how much it means to people whom I respect and admire. Take my colleague Robert Lopez, who had a hand in helping turn Hispanic Heritage Week into the 30-day observance it is now.
Lopez interned for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the summer of 1988 and was tasked with finding co-sponsors for the legislation that would extend Hispanic Heritage Week. He wrote a first-person account of his experience in 2013, which I encourage you to read.
In the process of getting the necessary signatures, Lopez learned about the past achievements of the Latinx community that he hadn’t been taught in school.
“I went to Azusa High, where there were many Latinos but there were no Latino or Chicano studies classes,” Lopez told me last year for a story I wrote on the monthlong event. “I never learned about the contributions of my community because it was never taught to us. We were taught a version of history that didn’t include us.”
That realization, the feeling of being cheated out of your own past, has been echoed by multiple people whom I’ve spoken to on the subject. And that’s where the value in Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month lies. Yes, it’s imperfect and has been made nearly intolerable by corporate America. But it’s also true that many of us don’t know the role we’ve played in shaping American history and society, myself included — it wasn’t until working for the Los Angeles Times that I learned about the Chicano Moratorium.
It’s not lost on me that Lyndon B. Johnson’s declaration establishing Hispanic Heritage Week singled out the educational community, tasking them with observing the holiday “with appropriate ceremonies and activities.” In the decades since, teachers, particularly at the collegiate level, have largely lived up to the task of chronicling the achievements, struggles and histories of Latinx Americans. A special shoutout to the Latinx/Chicanx professors out there.
A pragmatic approach to Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month
I asked Iliana Limón Romero, The Times’ deputy sports editor and a Latinx leader in the newsroom, to share her thoughts. Here’s what she wrote:
I have always thought of Hispanic Heritage Month as inauthentic pandering, but it’s been interesting to experience it in the Southwest and in Florida. I don’t speak for every person living in these areas, but generally people in the Southwest seem annoyed by the decision to mark half of one month and half of another to briefly pay attention and celebrate the same handful of historical figures.
In Florida, however, I was surprised by how many Puerto_Ricans and recent Central and South American immigrants were excited about Hispanic Heritage Month. They knew it was pandering, but they didn’t care because they were excited about a chance to celebrate their culture. If you paused to hand them a microphone, they were going to take it and own it.
There could be a correlation between the size of the Latinx population and the reaction. If you’re a true minority, you might be thrilled to have a chance to share more of your heritage with your neighbors.
I’m in a leadership role with a lot of journalism organizations and I long ago decided I would be happy to serve on committees and speak on panels to amplify our voices, but with my participation you get unfiltered commentary and called out for failed efforts to address inequality. I extract pledges and hold people accountable. So the holiday may be fake and represent a lot of pandering, but I see it as an opportunity."

Let’s settle the ‘Latinx’ debate once and for all

Today, we delve into the term “Latinx.” Whom does it refer to? Who uses it? And why do people on both the left and the right, Latino and not, get so worked up about it?
Fidel Martinez, who writes the Latinx Files newsletter for the L.A. Times, breaks it down. We’ll also hear from folks who identify as Latinx, and from L.A. Times columnist Jean Guerrero. She used “Latinx” in a tweet recently and has been weathering a backlash ever since.

The photo that captured the decades of failures of U.S. border policy
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

If you want to understand the history of immigration enforcement in the United States over the last 25 years, all you need to do is look at the photograph above.
Captured by photographer Paul Ratje, the image depicts a horse-mounted Border Patrol agent violently pulling on the shirt of a Haitian refugee holding plastic bags of food brought over from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, attempting to return to a camp near Del Rio, Texas, that had as many as 14,000 asylum seekers over the weekend.
The backlash was immediate.
The optics of a law enforcement officer riding a horse while trying to apprehend a defenseless Black man reminded people of the legacy of Jim Crow and the role that police played. Ratje’s photo made me think of the Texas Rangers terrorizing and lynching Mexicans and Mexican Americans near the very lands where this incident took place. Imagine the sense of irony I felt when I saw several Border Patrol agents who looked to be Hispanic in an Al Jazeera video that went viral.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer condemned President Biden’s continued usage of Title 42, a once obscure public health law used by the Trump administration at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to immediately expel people who crossed the border.
Even those in the Biden administration claimed to have been mortified by what transpired.
“What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback, treating human beings the way they were, is horrible,” said Vice President Kamala Harris. “And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there.”
“I was horrified by what I saw,” Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN. Mayorkas is the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection. “I’m going to let the investigation run its course. But the pictures that I observed troubled me profoundly. That defies all of the values that we seek to instill in our people.”
Forgive my cynicism, but it’s hard to reconcile the dismay expressed over this incident by Harris and Mayorkas, both children of immigrants, with their past actions. In June, Harris traveled to Guatemala, where she tersely told Central Americans not to come to the United States. A month later, Mayorkas did the exact same thing in Miami, directing his warning at Cubans and Haitians thinking about sailing to Florida.
The United States government has been in the business of mass deportation for more than a quarter of a century.
In 1994, Bill Clinton gave the U.S. Border Patrol the OK to launch “Operation Gatekeeper,” which critics point to as the moment in which the U.S.-Mexico border was militarized. Clinton also signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which made many more people living in the United States eligible for deportation and created the mechanism that would expedite their removal.
And let’s not forget Barack Obama, who deported more people in his two terms as president than all his predecessors combined. Obama’s record even earned him the moniker of “deporter in chief” from Univision’s Jorge Ramos.
Using the threat of violence to deter people who have risked everything — for years on end, in the case of many Haitian refugees (more on that later) — in hopes of a better life has been part of this country’s M.O. The only difference in this case is that photo and video journalists captured what went down.
The cruelty is the point.
The sad reality is that these brutal tactics tend to work. But this is just a Band-Aid on a wound that won’t heal. As The Times’ Molly Hennessy-Fiske reported on Tuesday, hundreds of refugees crossed the river back into Mexico. Who knows for how long?
“We’re all afraid they’re going to deport us,” Gabriel Valdeim, a 32-year-old construction worker at the Del Rio camp told Hennessy-Fiske. “I’m not going to say I’ll never try to cross again. But I’m going to wait to see how things are.”"

‘Latiné’ vs. ‘Latinx’: How a newly crowned Tony-winning playwright cast his vote
By BY JESSICA GELT


When playwright Matthew López accepted the prize for best play at the 74th Tony Awards, he became the first Latino in history to win the top drama category. He also became the first best-play winner to use the de-gendering term “Latiné"" to refer to people of Latin American descent.
“This is the 74th Tony Awards, and yet I am only the first Latiné writer to win in this category,” López said after “The Inheritance” nabbed four Tonys. “I say that not to elicit your applause, but to highlight the fact that the Latiné community is underrepresented in American theater, and most especially on Broadway.”
The word “Latiné"" may have been unfamiliar to some viewers, particularly those who may be used to hearing — and using — the more popular but not universally loved term “Latinx.”
“Latinx” began appearing online in the early 2000s and has gained currency because it eliminates the Spanish language’s gendered word ending (Latino for men and Latina for women). But as Daniel Hernandez pointed out in a 2017 Times op-ed, “The term is used mostly by an educated minority, largely in the U.S. And although there is little to no research yet on its specific origins, ‘Latinx’ is definitely not used by working-class immigrant adults, who probably have no idea that some of us brown folks are debating this at all.”
Others have argued that ending nouns and adjectives with an X instead of an O or A makes the language practically unpronounceable. In his piece, Hernandez called himself Latin.
On Sunday night at the Tony Awards, against a backdrop of a culture increasingly attuned to trans and nonbinary people, López opted for “Latiné,” a different approach to unify Latin American heritage under an inclusive term that gives no special favor to gender.
“The Inheritance,” which examines the lives of gay men in the generation after the AIDS epidemic, opened in London in 2018 and moved to Broadway in 2019. Times theater critic Charles McNulty called it López’s “magnum opus.”
While some on social media decried the selection of “The Inheritance” over Jeremy O. Harris’ “Slave Play” as yet another example of work centered on white characters instead of people of color, others defended López and argued that a Latino writer need not be required to focus exclusively on Latino characters.
In his acceptance speech, López asked theater fans to give more Latiné theater makers a chance to tell their stories.
“We have so many stories to tell,” he said. “They are inside of us, aching to come out.”"

The six Latinx ‘geniuses’
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

On Tuesday, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced the 25 recipients of the 2021 MacArthur Fellowship. This so-called genius grant is awarded to “individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction.”
In addition to the prestige, each fellow receives a no-strings-attached grant of $625,000 over five years.
This year, six Latinxs were awarded the fellowship: writer and radio producer Daniel Alarcón; microbiologist Dr. Victor J. Torres; filmmakers Cristina Ibarra and Alex Rivera; painter and sculptor Daniel Lind-Ramos; and historian Monica Muñoz Martinez.
“I’m stunned,” Rivera told The Times. “Over the moon and grateful. I’m also processing the scale of the challenges we face in our field.”
Rivera noted that the financial support he and Ibarra would get — the two are married (they are the first husband and wife to be named fellows in the same year) and are frequent collaborators — was critical.
It’s also, as Rivera put it, “less than half the budget of a one-hour episode of ‘Narcos.’”
“This fellowship will allow me to continue producing Latino cinema that is visually elevated and socially grounded. But there’s a massive machine already in place that produces representations of our community that are often misguided, sometimes hateful. To compete with that, I’ll have to build on this moment. Inspired by the recent achievements of politically committed, visionary filmmakers like Ava DuVernay, I know another cinema is possible. There’s no time to waste.”
While Rivera looks to the future (fitting given that some of his films, like 2008’s “Sleep Dealer,” which I’ve briefly written about in this space, are science fiction), Ibarra took time to acknowledge their predecessors.
“I can’t help but think about the story of our careers and our cinematic roots in socially driven documentaries and narratives,” she said.
“It wasn’t until I was exposed to the films of pioneer Chicana/o filmmakers like Lourdes Portillo, Nancy de los Santos, Hector Galán and Luis Valdez that I even realized we can make films. Today, as we look forward, I also want to think about the groundbreaking voices that opened up a space for us to keep pushing, updating and inventing our own visual language.”
With the exception of Torres, whose work focuses on better understanding drug-resistant bacteria in order to develop potential lifesaving therapies, the rest of the Latinx MacArthur fellows have something in common: They’re in the business of telling our people’s stories.
Alarcón is co-founder of “Radio Ambulante” and editorial director of “El Hilo,” two Spanish-language podcasts that explore the ties shared among Spanish speakers throughout the Americas.
Lind-Ramos uses found objects to create works of art that reflect his Afro-Puerto_Rican roots.
“My practice is like an exercise of memory,” said Lind-Ramos. “Objects linked to my personal, communal and regional Afro-Caribbean experience give me the opportunity to connect to that memory and to experiment with the formal and symbolic possibilities of its materiality.”
And then there’s Muñoz Martinez, whose projects center on telling the forgotten history of violence (much of it state-sanctioned) perpetrated against Mexicans and Mexican Americans along the Texas borderlands. If her work sounds awfully familiar, that’s because I frequently reference it in this newsletter. I did it last week when writing about the Border Patrol’s cruelty toward Haitian refugees near Del Rio, Texas.
“Historians have a responsibility to the profession to contribute new findings and advance knowledge,” said Muñoz Martinez. “But historians also have a responsibility to society more broadly to make sure that people have access to that knowledge. People have a right to learn truthful accounts of history in schools, museums, the news and popular culture, even when those histories are troubling.”
I love finding out that Latinxs have been named MacArthur fellows. It fills me with pride knowing that some of us are not only imagining cosas chingonas but actually doing them."

Parents sue state alleging Black and Latinx students are harmed by disciplinary practices
BY MELISSA GOMEZ

Black and Latinx students are disproportionately harmed by the state’s failure to exert oversight and take action against some school district disciplinary practices, including transferring students to alternative and often inferior programs, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday by parents and an advocacy group.
The suit alleges that students of color continue to be overrepresented in expulsion and suspension rates reported by school districts annually and that the state has not done enough to address the disparity. It also alleges that lax state intervention and reporting policies allow school districts to mask some disciplinary practices by transferring students to alternative schools, where honors and advanced placement courses are not often offered and college-required courses may not always be available.
State policy requires school districts to publicly report expulsions and suspensions, but not student transfers.
Tony Thurmond, state superintendent of public instruction, and the California Department of Education are named as defendants in the suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
A spokesperson from the education department declined to comment on the suit, which he said officials have not yet reviewed.
The plaintiffs, which include parents in Kern and Los Angeles counties and an advocacy group called Black Parallel School Board, are asking the court to force the state to increase oversight of school districts by addressing what they allege are discriminatory disciplinary practices, including informal suspensions and transfers.
“The students are the ones who lose because no one is playing that oversight role to ensure they’re having equal access to education,” said Sahar Durali, an attorney with Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles who is representing the plaintiffs.
Since 2015, the statewide expulsion and suspension rates have trended downward, according to state data.
The lawsuit cites the Antelope Valley Union High School District, which serves students in Lancaster and Palmdale. The district reported 61 expulsions during the 2018-19 school year, similar to the state’s trend. Black students were overrepresented in those expelled, the lawsuit alleges.
But after compiling data through public records requests, the lawsuit alleges the district transferred 573 students to alternative schools, but did not publicly report the actions, which is not required by the state.
District officials did not respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday.
The suit alleges districts have pressured some parents into signing waivers that give up their child’s right to an expulsion hearing, allowing districts to label cases as “voluntary transfers.” Districts also label disciplinary actions as “involuntary transfers” or “expulsions by another name” when moving students initially referred for expulsion from general education into an alternative learning setting, according to the lawsuit.
Plaintiffs alleged this allows school districts to report low expulsion rates to disguise the “disparate treatment” of Black and Latinx students and evade responsibility.
School districts maintain the authority to set transfer policies, but the plaintiffs said in the suit that the state education department has “failed to exercise any meaningful oversight of waivers and has failed to create reporting requirements for voluntary transfers or waivers.”
School districts across California are “masking their exclusionary discipline practices,” the suit said, and the state’s top education institution is violating the right of equal protection for students under the state Constitution by failing to safeguard their right to an equal education.
Black students have long encountered excessive school discipline in California, advocates said. Previously, Black parents in the Los Angeles Unified School District accused administrators of sending their children home without a formal suspension, a practice known as “off the book.”
The lawsuit alleges that “off the book” suspensions persist today across the state, and the Education Department has failed to address the disparity in reported suspension rates. During the 2018-19 school year, Black and Latinx students were often overrepresented in reported suspension rates.
During the 2018-19 school year, Black students in the Sacramento City Unified School District received 41.4% of suspensions while they made up 15.5% of the population, the lawsuit alleges. That same year in the Riverside Unified School District, Latinx students received 71% of expulsions but made up 63% of the population.
By failing to monitor districts, the plaintiffs say, the state is further harming students of color, who often deal with far-reaching repercussions from expulsions and suspensions, including lost instructional time and a higher risk of dropping out.
One of the parents suing the state says her son was subjected to an informal suspension in 2019, when campuses were still open for in-person learning. The parent, who lives in Kern County, said her son, who is 9 and has the Section 504 plan that allows for extra support services for students with disabilities, was suspended for not listening to his teacher and “destroying” school property after rubbing his pencil eraser on a chair.
The fourth-grader was suspended for two days, and the parent, who asked to remain anonymous, was not given an opportunity to discuss the suspension with the school, the lawsuit says. She also learned later that her son was suspended during other instances.
During the 2020-21 school year, when schools statewide were remote, the fourth-grader was blocked from attending online classes at least three times, the lawsuit alleges, with the teacher excluding the 9-year-old from online games that were part of the curriculum.
“We, as parents, have been telling them, complaining” about how students are treated, the parent said in an interview. She said the district has not taken the concerns of parents seriously. “We have been overlooked as if it’s not important.”
Her son’s attitude toward school has taken a turn as a result of the suspensions and being yelled at by one of his teachers in front of other students, she said. He used to be excited to go to school, greet his bus driver, but now, she said, it’s “a tough time to get him up and ready for school.”
In 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law an expanded ban on the use of “willful defiance” suspensions for elementary and middle school students. Research had shown that such suspensions, which many deemed as arbitrary, have been disproportionately applied to Black students. Suspensions have also been shown to have a detrimental impact on students and their educational paths.
The Black Parallel School Board advocated for the suspension ban and signed onto the Wednesday lawsuit to seek reporting transparency from districts.
“Our parents across the state feel that no one is watching these districts do the right thing,” said Carl Pinkston, operations director for the group. “Our members feel frustrated, angry, and feel that the state of California has failed Black students.”
While the data cited in the complaint were collected before the coronavirus shut down schools for more than a year, Pinkston acknowledged that a lot of students are coming back to the classroom dealing with the trauma inflicted by the pandemic.
But many districts jumped straight into instructional mode instead of a restorative approach to give students time to adjust to a highly structured setting, Pinkston said. With schools flush with federal and state funding, Pinkston said it’s an opportunity for the state to put resources behind increased monitoring on school discipline.
“This is one step, one brick, one piece, along a long road to really bring about transformation in the education system,” Pinkston said."

Renting is a struggle for Black and Latinx Californians, report finds
BY JUSTIN RAY

Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It’s Thursday, Oct. 28. I’m Justin Ray.
Economists say you shouldn’t spend more than 30% of your earnings on rental costs. But a recent report reveals troubling information about renting in California — specifically for residents of color.
The findings of a Zillow report showed that Black and Latino renters are paying a high percentage of their income on rent. For instance, “across all races and markets analyzed, Black renters in San Diego are the most rent burdened, spending more than half (52.6%) of their income on rent.”
“The results of this study are infuriating, but not surprising,” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria told The Times in a statement. “Historically, as San Diego has moved forward, its communities of color have often been left behind. That’s why one of the first things I did after being sworn in as mayor was to make equity central to everything we do and every decision we make. My top priority as Mayor is to ensure that all San Diegans have a roof over their head at a price they can afford.”
The Zillow report also asserts that while the most unaffordable rental market for Latino renters is Orlando, where such households can spend 42.0% of their income on rent, that is “still less than the Black household rent burden in three other metros — San Diego (as noted), Sacramento, and San Francisco.”
Zillow explained the methodology behind the study to The Times. The analysis looked at 100 local markets in the U.S. The income data are from the American Community Survey, a demographics survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data about rents paid are also from ACS, blended with the company’s own rent index.
The Times has found that there are other factors harming residents of color in the state:
Black Americans have long been more likely to have unaffordable rent and mortgages compared with white people, census data show. With the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic, Black households face a greater probability of being unable to pay, raising the risk that some people may be forced onto the streets or into shelters already disproportionately occupied by Black people.
“Crime-free housing” is a collection of policies that have expanded the power of the police to decide who can and can’t live in more than a thousand cities across the country. A map of the programs’ expansion has left a distinct pattern: As Black and Latino people moved to the suburbs, crime-free housing policies often came soon after, making it easier for landlords to reject or eject current and would-be tenants. Considering that Black and the Latino communities are disproportionately the target of law enforcement, it can easily be seen how this policy makes it harder for people of color to find housing. My homie Fidel Martinez explains it further in an edition of his newsletter “Latinx Files.”
Homes in Los Angeles neighborhoods such as Crenshaw, West Adams, Hyde Park, Leimert Park and, of course, Baldwin Village and View Park now regularly sell for north of $1 million. Bidding wars among white families are common. In an effort to preserve the racial makeup of these neighborhoods, this has meant that some Black residents have to fork over the eye-popping down payments and accept the exorbitant mortgages that have become the norm of home-buying in places like South L.A."

‘Thermal inequity’ and who bears the brunt
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

There is a graphic a few paragraphs into this story written by Tony Barboza and Ruben Vives about the “thermal inequities” that exist in Los Angeles that really makes clear what role the legacy of racism and discrimination has played in creating them.
It was made by assistant data and graphics editor Sean Greene, and it juxtaposes a map of L.A. neighborhoods that shows the surface temperature on July 14, 2018, with another that highlights the percentage of sun protection provided by the tree canopy in each area. They’re nearly identical. Neighborhoods with large Latinx, Black and Asian populations are a lot hotter than their white counterparts and also get less shade from trees.
According to a study conducted by UC Davis researchers, heavily Latinx neighborhoods in Los Angeles were 6.7 degrees hotter than neighborhoods with fewer Latinx residents during extreme heat days.
“These microclimates aren’t natural, they are man-made,” Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental health scientist at UC Berkeley, told The Times.
They’re also not exclusive to Los Angeles. Last year, researchers found that formerly redlined neighborhoods were nearly five degrees hotter than other areas.
“Heat waves don’t just kill people by coincidence,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University. “There’s really a set of conditions that are in place.”
A Times analysis found that extreme heat was a factor in over 3,900 deaths in California over the last decade, the hottest on record. This is six times higher than the official count of 599 heat-related fatalities reported by the state.
The scary part is things are only going to get worse.
According to a recent climate vulnerability assessment released by Los Angeles County, more than 1 million Angelenos live in areas that will experience an additional 30 extreme-heat days a year by 2050. These areas also happen to have large Latinx populations. Notice a trend?
With the pandemic, unemployment, income inequality and now “thermal inequities,” the Latinx community is bearing the brunt of another crisis. It almost makes you wonder if this could be a contributing factor to the seeming lack of urgency in addressing this issue."

Facebook’s Latinx disinformation problem
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

It’s no secret that Facebook has a misinformation problem in Spanish and English, but just how much did the company know about how that disinformation was spreading in Latinx communities? According to a troubling new report from my colleagues Brian Contreras and Maloy Moore, it turns out Facebook knew a lot more than it let on.
“Facebook has not been transparent at all,” Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher at Equis Labs, told The Times. Also, he said, the company “has not been cooperative with lawmakers or Latinx-serving organizations” working to combat its spread.
The article highlights how the company, which also owns social platforms Instagram and WhatsApp, repeatedly stonewalled Latino-centric advocacy groups, even after Facebook’s own employees were ringing the alarm internally, according to documents made public by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Among the issues employees flagged were possible voting suppression and the discouraging of Latinxs from filling out the census form.
What’s troubling is the company hasn’t really said how it plans to fix the spread of viral misinformation in the Latinx community. In June, a group of senators and representatives wrote a letter expressing “concerns regarding the increasing rate of Spanish and other non-English language disinformation.”
“We received a response from Facebook, and it was really more of the same — no concrete, direct answers to any of our questions,” said a spokesperson for Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Pacoima), one of the signatories.
Even worse is the fact that Facebook, which has now rebranded to Meta, has pivoted to a more defensive approach when in comes to addressing controversies.
Back in September, I made a snide comment about how you should be concerned that Mark Zuckerberg was going to be a key player in building out the metaverse, the virtual reality version of the internet that looks to be our future. But I also meant it. Facebook has already staked a claim. That should be concerning to you.
After all, what makes you think this company will be adept at dealing with all the problems that will surely arise with the advent of this new technology? What indication have you gotten from Facebook that it would even care?
Today’s episode of The Times podcast, hosted by Gustavo Arellano, focuses on disinformation on social media and how it affects Latinxs. You can listen to it here."

How Latinos are bonding over first-generation trauma
BY KAREN GARCIA

Leslie Gonzalez’s path to becoming a doctor was filled with overwhelming pressure, stress and anxiety. Classroom struggles, the challenge of juggling a part-time job and schoolwork — Gonzalez labeled herself a failure. And on top of that, she felt the pressure of being one of the only Latinas in her medical school setting.
“A lot of impostor syndrome came into play, and I would often feel stressed out and anxious. I would call my parents and tell them, ‘I’m so done with this’ and just have one of those breakdowns,” she said.
Those feelings were always followed by a crushing wave of guilt. Gonzalez, a child of immigrant parents, would tell herself to “pull it together because [she] had to make [her] parents’ sacrifices worth it.” She couldn’t cope with these feelings.
At the time, Gonzalez was studying osteopathic medicine at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona and sought professional help from one of the school’s therapists. Through nine months of therapy sessions, she learned that her pressures came in part from her position in her family.
“A lot of it was because I was put on a pedestal for a very long time due to being the first born and having so much responsibility,” Gonzalez said.
As the oldest of four children, Gonzalez’s dad referred to her as the leader of the pack. She set the standard for what her siblings could achieve academically and personally. She describes herself as the advocate for her family.
Gonzalez and others in the Latino community are taking to social media to share their understanding and experience of first-generation trauma. It’s a colloquial term some Latino Americans use to describe the emotional struggles of children whose parents are immigrants.
There are differing definitions of who is considered “first generation,” often dependent on whether they are born outside the U.S. or have citizenship. But Gonzalez and others are bonding over a shared experience.
Gonzalez shares her point of view about her traumas on TikTok and Instagram. Gina Moreno talks about breaking the cycle of self-neglect as a first-generation Latina on TikTok. Erika Cruz talks about the dependency that immigrant parents have with their first-generation children.
What connects these struggles is that they affect children of immigrants — typically but not always the first born, and the first to navigate certain aspects of American society. According to mental health professionals, these experiences can range from stressors to traumas and can be caused by experiences inside the home or out in society.
One-on-one therapy sessions gave Gonzalez the space to understand herself, acknowledge her feelings, and develop healthy coping strategies.
For people whose struggles feel similar to Gonzalez’s, The Times asked Southern California trauma therapists and an academic about how to define first-generation trauma, what causes it and how people can heal.
What is first generation trauma?
The conversation about first-generation trauma is emerging in the Latino community, specifically in social media spaces focused on improving mental health. It tends to be found with the hashtag #firstgen.
In those same spaces are the conversations on generational (or intergenerational) trauma, which differs from first-generation trauma because it is trauma passed down through generations.
There isn’t a definition of the term because it hasn’t been widely explored yet, Manuel Zamarripa director and co-founder of the Institute of Chicana/o/x Psychology said.
It’s more about the specific experience of the children who struggle to reconcile the culture clashes between American society and their immigrant households.
“Stress” could be a more appropriate word than “trauma,” some experts said. They cite the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration which defines trauma as an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects.
“Trauma is a heavy-hitting word,” Zamarripa said.He added: “In our effort to educate, we don’t want to promote or perpetuate a narrative that we’re just walking around as individuals that are significantly damaged or traumatized.”
Zamarripa suggests using the terms first-generation trauma or first-generation stress depending on a person’s unique experiences.
Here are some common experiences of children of immigrants that can contribute to first-generation trauma or stress:
Parentification: This is when a child is obliged to act as a parent to their own parent or sibling, perhaps translating at a doctor’s appointment or filing taxes for a parent who doesn’t speak English. “There is a lot of pressure to be that person for your family, so later on, a lot of folks, like first-generation professionals, really struggle with asking for help,” Vanessa Pezo, a licensed trauma therapist based in Long Beach, said.
Gonzalez said before her parents came to the U.S., her mother was studying to be a nurse and her father was a civil engineer in Guadalajara, Mexico, but they didn’t speak English. In the U.S., they took English classes at night. While the classes helped, they still relied on Gonzalez to translate documents that came in the mail or from the doctor.
Assimilation: The Migration Policy Institute explains assimilation as the integration of people or culture into a dominant culture and society. Agueda Rivas, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said when a child of immigrants begins to navigate the world outside their parents’ home — at school or at a friend’s house, for example — they start to question their parents’ cultural teachings in order to fit in, which can lead to disagreements at home.
Code-switching: Rivas explained code-switching as a person changing the way they speak, act, or interact with others in specific settings, such as the workplace. Someone who frequently juggles two very different versions of themselves to get by at work, for example, could start to feel emotionally exhausted.Attachment trauma: This refers to trauma that can occur within family relationships, Pezo explained. “It could be feeling like their needs weren’t met appropriately, not getting emotional support, not feeling as if there was the ability to really connect and feel safe within those relationships maybe because of environmental stressors that were existing at the time,” she said.
In Pezo’s work, clients have said their parents have responded to their emotional distress by saying “te calmas o te calmo” which translates to “calm down or I’ll calm you down.” Or a parent might respond by telling the child “Por que lloras? No llores.” — Why are you crying? Don’t cry. Instead of acknowledging their feelings, the child is unintentionally taught to push it aside.
Zamarripa said that many clinicians talk about first-generation trauma within the context of the family — family relationships and the strife within them. But: “That’s a very Western way of looking at things. In actuality, the kids go to school and the parents go to work outside of the house,” he said.
He argues that a majority of the stressors emanate from external factors. And people bring those experiences, positive or negative, home at the end of the day, and racist rhetoric or negative expectations in the workplace get added to individual stressors.
“It’s important that our community doesn’t continue to internalize this notion of a deficit within our Latinx cultural context,” Zamarripa said. “We should not internalize a narrative or idea that all this comes from within us. A lot of this comes from all the hits that we take outside the family that we don’t realize we’re trying to negotiate when we come together.”
How do these experiences impact your life?
At a young age, some children of immigrant parents had to navigate school, government agencies, or workplaces alone — because they’re the first in their family to do so — so as an adult, it’s not easy to identify the imbalance they’re feeling or ask for help.
Mental healthcare professionals The Times spoke to were unanimous in saying that the result can look like burnout, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, impostor syndrome, hyper-independence, physical pain (migraines or stomach aches), or negating your feelings.
Pezo and Agueda said that people have the mindset of working hard and not being able complain because that would mean they’re “malagradecido” — ungrateful.
Gonzalez said the reason her parents made the difficult decision of leaving their lives in Guadalajara was to have better educational opportunities for their future family and eventually build generational wealth in the U.S.
So when Gonzalez struggled in medical school, she ultimately feared letting her parents down.
“Really all that fear came from the pressure that I felt to become someone — to be somebody important in this country who could give back to their parents and make their sacrifices worth it,” she said.
What you can do
There is no one way, or one right way, to work through traumatic and stressful experiences, and there won’t be a set timeline.
Your journey, Pezo said, will be an individual one and may involve validating your experiences with a therapist or with a trusted person (family member, friend, community leader or religious leader).
Here’s how mental health professionals approach first generation trauma and stress with clients.
Acknowledgment: After talking about your upbringing and any external significant experiences, Pezo works with clients to acknowledge what their parents have done for them and eliminate the idea of blanket respect — the feeling of not being able to criticize your parents because you’ll be seen as ungrateful.
“I do a lot of, ‘We can honor the fact that I love and respect my parents, and I’m so grateful for everything that they did for me to allow me to be the person I am today. And I was also hurt by some of the things they did,” she said.
Open conversations: As you start to understand your lived experiences, Agueda said, you might be interested in talking with your parents about how a certain life event made you feel.
She said these conversations, if you choose to have them, are going to be difficult because each person has their own perspective. During the conversation, if your parent tries to interject with their own experience and say it was worse than yours, Agueda said to see it as a window.
“Come at that with: ‘Nunca me has dicho eso,’” — You’ve never told me that — “and ask them to tell you more about it,” she said.
But parents or guardians might not want to get specific because it’s too painful. Agueda said to approach these discussions with humility and grace.
Learning to cope with setbacks: Gonzalez felt out of balance when dealing with school, societal pressures of becoming somebody, and the inadvertent pressures from her parents.
“I’m so glad I went to therapy, because it really helped me to be OK with the setbacks and failures. It made me realize that it’s part of life,” Gonzalez said.
Healthy boundaries: In her sessions, Gonzalez learned to create healthy boundaries with her parents, who at one time only asked her for help. She continues to help them in any way she can, but her parents ask her siblings now too. She sets a day to talk with her mom on the phone, instead of being available 24/7, and post-graduation, moved into her own home with her partner.
Letting go of blame: Gonzalez doesn’t blame anyone for her mental health challenges, especially not her parents. She said her parents were put in a difficult situation when they came to the U.S., a challenge that many immigrant parents endure.
“I just take it for what it was. It was them trying to figure out how we were going to survive and make life better for themselves and our family,” she said.
Destigmatizing mental health: Zamarripa said part of this healing journey is reframing how we understand mental health struggles.
“It doesn’t mean you’re loco or that’s something is wrong with you,” he said. “It’s what’s happened in your life that’s tipped the scales, and we need to work on getting it back into balance.”"

A Latinx toll ‘for generations to come’
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

This morning, The Times published a series of articles written by my colleague Alejandra Reyes-Velarde that examine the heavy toll the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on the Latinx community.
It’s been rough.
“Latinos are getting hit from all angles,” said Christina Ramirez, professor of biostatistics at UCLA. “This is going to be felt for generations to come.”
The pandemic has been financially disastrous for people like Glenda Valenzuela and Mario Alarcon, an undocumented married couple who felt like they were on the cusp of reaching some semblance of security before the world shut down. The two worked as janitors, cleaning office buildings and schools. Alarcon’s hours were reduced, and Valenzuela lost her job completely.
Before, they dreamed of moving to a bigger place and would splurge a little by taking their kids to Chuck E. Cheese from time to time. Now, they’re just trying to stay afloat.
“We can’t give ourselves the luxury of spending money just like that,” said Alarcon. “We have to make magic with the numbers.”
The still-ongoing pandemic has also robbed us of life.
UCLA biostatistics researcher Jay Xu estimates that California Latinxs have lost about 370,000 years of potential life to the coronavirus as of Dec. 1. Latinxs ages 20 to 54 are dying from COVID-19 at a higher rate than their counterparts in other racial and ethnic groups.
More troubling is the fact that COVID-19 cases are spiking nationwide yet again, due mostly to the Delta variant. Who knows when all of this will be over.
“It’s infuriating, the people who don’t want to get vaccinated. It affects us, because as long as we’re not vaccinated, the pandemic won’t end,” Alarcon told The Times. “If things close again, we’ll be worse off.”"

Column: Why Democrats should worry about more Latinos going for GOP in 2024
BY GUSTAVO ARELLANO

Imagine the following scenario:
Donald Trump enters the 2024 presidential election, but announces he’s replacing former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate with a Latino. The former president argues it’s about time everyone acknowledge what was once thought impossible: Latinos want to go Republican en masse.
He picks someone younger, more charismatic, and even more conservative than him — a child of an immigrant who grew up poor but pulled himself up by the proverbial bootstraps to succeed in the U.S. It’s such an impeccable story that any accusations that Trump’s choice is a vendido — a sellout — fall flatter and are cheesier than a quesadilla.
From East Los Angeles to South Texas, Little Havana to Washington Heights, just enough inspired Latinos become the swing vote that secures Trump’s win — maybe even the first time ever that a GOP presidential candidate wins a majority of the Latino electorate. The GOP thus finally fulfills the prophecy long attributed to Ronald Reagan — that Latinos are Republicans who just don’t know it yet.
Crazy scenario, right? Actually, no.
In an alternate universe, this could’ve totally been a thing — and recent polls and studies that show Latinos are more politically conservative than at any point in recent memory are proof of this.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Latinos its pollsters talked to support Republicans and Democrats in equal numbers, and that only one percentage point separates Joe Biden from Trump in a hypothetical 2024 rematch among the Latinos they surveyed. Two Democratic-friendly research groups found that Latinos are increasingly dissatisfied with the blue view. Another Democrat-aligned firm discovered that the use of “Latinx” by Democratic politicians offends enough Latinos to the point that 30% of the ones they talked to would be less likely to vote for a politician who used the term.
Even a Fairleigh Dickinson University study that found Americans believe there’s a War on Christmas more than ever before revealed that Latinos buy that humbug more fervently than any other ethnic group.
All this news comes a year after Trump — who, quick recap, dismissed Mexicans trying to come into the United States in the 2015 speech that announced his first presidential run as rapists and drug dealers, posed with a hideous-looking taco salad in a 2016 Cinco de Mayo tweet, and referred to El_Salvador as a “shithole” country in 2018 — built bigly on his 2016 Latino support to earn 38% percent of our vote. It was the highest such percentage since George W. Bush got 44% of the Latino vote in 2004.
The conservative political swing by Latinos has set off furious finger-pointing among Democratic operatives and glee among conservative ones, who now hope one of the gifts under their Christmas tree this year is the 2022 Latino vote (poor Democrats, meanwhile, are stuck with a giant lump of West Virginia coal in their stocking).
I wrote about this phenomenon in multiple columns leading up to and after the 2020 presidential elections. I’m seeing it on the streets, in social media, and in the poll numbers — it’s real, and it’s reaching a boil.
There are many immediate reasons why more Latinos are voting Republican right now: an attraction to Trump’s bluster, an exhaustion with COVID-19 mandates, a repudiation of the social justice causes that Democrats have campaigned on for the past couple of years at the expense of the economy.
Democratic activists dismiss these points, and instead blame the very real disinformation campaigns on social media that paint President Biden as a communist at best and a child-eating reptilian at worst as swaying too many Latinos to leave their party. But the most important reason why there’s always a chance for Latinos to flip conservative is because it’s inherently within us thanks to a political philosophy that I call rancho libertarianism.
It’s the core beliefs of working-class Latinos, many influenced by their roots in the rural parts of their ancestral countries. Whether you live in Appalachia, the highlands of Jalisco, County Cork in Ireland, or Sicily, country folk often share common traits — rugged individualism, distrust of government and elites, conservative moral beliefs, a love of community and a hatred of political correctness — that are like catnip for Republicans.
It was the worldview of the millions of Catholic European immigrants of previous generations — Irish, Poles, Italians, Germans — who once reliably voted Democrat but whose descendants embraced Trump. It’s the worldview of my dad, uncles, aunts, Mexican-born older cousins, and their millennial children with businesses and young families. Traces of rancho libertarianism are still in my political veins, much to the consternation of my leftist pals.
Every single GOP president going back to Richard Nixon has known about rancho libertarianism, even if they didn’t call it by that name.
It’s why Nixon was about to propose the first amnesty for undocumented immigrants before Watergate derailed those plans. It’s why Reagan remains the only president to ever pass such an amnesty. It’s why George W. Bush — whose brother Jeb married a Mexican immigrant — famously said that family values don’t end at the Rio Grande, a perspective that helped him earn almost half of the Latino vote in 2004.
So if Latinos have always been potential Republicans, why hadn’t party leaders capitalized on rancho libertarianism? The standard answer for a generation has been California Republicans.
Over the course of 12 years, from 1986 to 1998, they helped pass a series of xenophobic propositions — 63, 187, 209, and 227, which respectively made English the official language of California, made life miserable for illegal immigrants, ended affirmative action, and stopped bilingual education in public schools. That turned off a significant portion of the Latino electorate and radicalized a generation of them. Those Latinos, of course, have turned California into a place bluer than Papa Smurf.
What happened in California to the GOP is frequently offered as a cautionary tale of the last gasps of a dying party. But that was a generation ago. Younger Latinos either don’t know that history, or don’t care because they got theirs already — and have now followed in the footsteps of their fellow ethnic Catholics in assimilating and hating the new immigrants in town. It’s why Trump could trash Central American migrant caravans trying to come into this country during his administration and not see his support among Latinos crater but actually increase.
It brings to mind “What’s the Matter with Kansas,” Thomas Frank’s brilliant 2004 book about why his fellow Jayhawkers voted against their political interests by consistently siding with the GOP. In a 2022 election that’s already shaping up to be a ballot-box bloodbath for Democrats, seeing more Latinos go Republican could unleash an electoral earthquake that would change American politics forever.
I hope this doesn’t happen, because I’d rather not see Latinos side with a party that’s anti-science and anti-reason. Anti-logic, anti-women — and still, pretty darn often, beneath the giant taco salads and calls for personal responsibility, anti-Latino."

The Latinx Year that was
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

When Jennifer Lopez sang, “Let’s get loud!” at Joe Biden’s inauguration back in January, I seriously doubt she meant it as a challenge. And yet, 2021 took it as such.
With only two days left to this wretched year, I think I speak for everyone when I say que se puede ir al carajo.
2021 sucked. Big time. It’s like it saw how harsh 2020 was, told it to hold its beer, then tried to one-up it.
It certainly succeeded when it came to the pandemic and the way it affected the Latinx community. Sure, 2021 brought us the vaccine, but its rollout was not without gringaderas — in Los Angeles, some residents of whiter, affluent neighborhoods drove to predominantly Black and Latinx communities to get the shot before it was their turn.
COVID-19 extracted a heavy toll from our health, our wallets and our education. As my colleague Alejandra Reyes-Velarde reported in her recent series “Pandemic portraits: The Latino experience,” COVID-19 has cost California Latinxs about 370,000 years of potential life. It has stolen the hearts of families, and has caused familial rifts.
And then there’s immigration, a subject I’ve written about in this space often. When Joe Biden was running for president, he promised to undo much of the damage wreaked by the Trump administration. Nearly a year into his presidency, he has continued two of his predecessor’s more controversial practices: Title 42 and Remain in Mexico. Biden has also failed to deliver on any meaningful immigration reform.
What, then, differentiates his administration from the last? Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the person who oversees the Border Patrol and ICE, is Latinx. Representation is important, after all.
And speaking of, Hollywood once again got called out for pretending we don’t exist even though the U.S. Census told us Latinxs accounted for half of the country’s population growth in the last 10 years. To its credit, it did the bare minimum and gave us “In the Heights” and “West Side Story,” two problematic musicals that nobody watched.
Admittedly, not everything about 2021 was bad. We had some victories.
In the world of sport, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn gave Puerto_Rico its second-ever Olympic gold medal after winning the 100-meter hurdles at the Tokyo Games, and Canelo Alvarez made Mexicans on both sides of the border proud when he became the first boxer from Latin America to unify a division after knocking out Caleb Plant in November. Legendary NFL coach Tom Flores finally got his due and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
And no one had a better 2021 than Bad Bunny, who spent the better part of the year haciendo lo que le da la gana. Not only did San Benito continue his dominion over the world by being Spotify’s most streamed artist for the second year in a row, but he also branched out into acting and wrestling.
This year also brought us some LOLs. Remember Jenny 69, la chingona que salió de Riversai? To this day, I still find myself uttering the phrase “From a pobrecita to a bad b—” whenever I need to fill the uncomfortable silence in my head.
But despite all the good and all the laughs, the point still stands: 2021 can head to the dustbin of history now.
This year tried its best to end us. And yet here we are. We’re still here. How could we not be? We’ve survived dictatorships, desapariciones, migration, and the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement.
We’ve survived despite being underschooled, underemployed and underpaid. 2021 felt like hell on earth, and yet we survived it too. 2022 looks to be no different — the year hasn’t even begun yet and the government has already started waving the white flag on COVID-19, not to mention the upcoming midterm elections — and guess what? We’ll still be here 12 months from now."

Essential workers, many of them Latinx, are back on the front lines as Omicron surges
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

As coronavirus case numbers continue to skyrocket around the country, as long testing lines return, and as the calls and text messages from friends and family confirming positive tests start rolling in like it’s 2020, it bears repeating that it is the Latinx community that will once again bear the brunt of the latest variant.
We saw this happen in spring 2020. Latinx workers were tasked with keeping the economy going, exposing themselves to the virus that has been so devastating and brutal.
And the messaging from elected officials and health experts is seemingly putting the economy on the front burner in another replay of 2020.
For me, that feeling of deja vu began on Dec. 27, after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House top adviser on COVID-19, went on CNN to explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reduced the number of isolation days for asymptomatic people infected with COVID-19 from five to 10. The guidelines also didn’t require asymptomatic people to get a negative coronavirus test after quarantining.
“If you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, especially those with essential jobs,” he said. “They can get back to the workplace, doing things that are important to keep society running smoothly.”
Unsurprisingly, there was backlash. On Twitter, USC Professor Natalia Molina expressed what many of us were thinking.
“#CDC says ‘Sana sana colita de rana.’,” she tweeted.
I felt it once again after newly elected New York City Mayor Eric Adams pleaded with big businesses to reopen for the sake of those who didn’t have the option of working from home.
“If we don’t open our cities, that’s almost a million people who are behind in our rent right here in this city,” he said, making no mention of New York’s eviction moratorium expiring next week.
“My low-skilled workers, my cooks, my dishwashers, my messengers, my shoe-shine people, those who work at Dunkin’ Donuts — they don’t have the academic skills to sit in the corner office,” added Adams, a former police officer who spent decades in a department that doesn’t require a college degree to be hired.
Never mind that a recent report put out by the UCLA Labor Center found that fast-food workers faced increased health risks and labor violations during the pandemic.
“Fast-food workers have showed up every day of the COVID-19 pandemic, risking our lives to keep our stores open and our communities fed,” said Angelica Hernandez, a McDonald’s worker from Los Angeles.
“The companies we work for have called us essential, but this report shows they think we’re disposable and that they’ve decided keeping us in unsafe and unsanitary conditions is worth it for higher corporate profits. But we won’t be silent — my co-workers and I will continue to fight for better working conditions and a voice on the job, so that our families and our communities can feel safe and thrive.”
For all the efforts to keep the economy going, COVID-19 is still disrupting the way we live.
In Los Angeles, the healthcare system is facing staffing shortages because workers keep getting infected, and on Tuesday The Times reported that more than 1,000 police officers, firefighters and paramedics were ill or quarantined at home.
As we relive some of the worst parts of the early days of the pandemic, we can at least be thankful that this variant doesn’t appear to be as deadly as previous mutations.
But until we’re in the clear, rest assured that it’s our most vulnerable that will continue to suffer. After all, when given the choice of losing one’s livelihood or risk getting infected, the latter option will continue to win out, especially when the Biden administration has already made it clear it has no plans on providing financial relief."

Will Puerto_Rico stop being for Puerto_Ricans soon?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Brenda Velázquez hoped to spend the rest of her days living in her two-bedroom apartment in Quebradillas, Puerto_Rico, a quiet town roughly 65 miles west of San Juan that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. On days when the power would go out, a frequent occurrence on the island, she’d sit on her bedroom balcony and pass the time.
But those plans were dashed in November when she found out her building, the San José Hills Apartments, had been bought by another tenant, Giovanni Feroce, who wanted to kick everyone out by the end of the year. His plan was to convert the structure into a hotel or into Airbnb rentals.
A former Rhode Island resident and failed gubernatorial candidate, Feroce moved to Puerto_Rico in 2019 to take advantage of Act 60, tax breaks implemented by the local government that incentivize foreigners to move to the island by offering zero taxes on passive income and capital gains.
These incentives are not available to Puerto_Rican residents, and it’s resulting in the likes of Logan Paul, crypto bros and tax dodgers like Feroce (he owes more than $1 million in back taxes to Rhode Island) moving there.
It’s also displacing actual Puerto_Ricans.
“They’re pushing us out,” Yanira Ocasio, another San José Hills resident, told independent journalist Bianca Graulau, who broke the story of what’s happening in Quebradillas on her YouTube channel in a 15-minute video.
“They’re pushing us out of our place. When we open our eyes we won’t have an island and we will be Puerto_Rico without Puerto_Ricans.”
I’d like to tell you that this story has a happy ending, but it doesn’t. As Graulau noted in her video and in a recent interview with Latino Rebels Radio, Feroce has let some of the San José Hills residents stay until March but he’s still planning on evicting them.
But if pressed to find a silver lining in all this, I’d point to the fact that this story was reported on in the first place.
A graduate of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Journalism, Graulau worked in broadcast news at the local and national level, in English and in Spanish, before moving back to Puerto_Rico and going independent. In November 2019, she launched her YouTube channel with a video on how rising sea levels are swallowing up the island’s beaches. That video has been viewed more than 1.4 million times, and Graulau has since accrued hundreds of thousands of followers on TikTok (she’s got 372,000 followers, more than double the 170,000 people who follow the L.A. Times TikTok account), Instagram , and YouTube.
Graulau has established herself as a reliable source of news for Puerto_Ricans. So much so, in fact, that it was an Instagram follower who tipped her about what was going on in Quebradillas via direct message.
She credits her decision to go independent for this, pointing out that many journalists of color who want to tell these kinds of stories are often being held back by their superiors.
“Management doesn’t always defer to us to know what our audience really wants,” she told The Times, noting that no outlet would really give her the time and resources to produce a 15-minute video on this topic. “We have to fight to get those stories done.”
“When you’re independent, you trust your gut and you leave it up to the audience to decide whether you made a good or bad decision and you’re going to see that in the comments, you’re going to see that in the response and the views.”
So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Graulau tells me that the support of her audience has enabled her to keep working on the stories she cares about. Her next report, which focuses on real estate development in legally protected land in Puerto_Rico, was crowdfunded by her supporters.
She didn’t give me a timeline for when it will be published, though rest assured I’ll link to it in this space when it goes live."

Newsletter: Aperture covers a century of Latino image-making. It’s the tip of the iceberg
BY CAROLINA A. MIRANDA

“You can be moody, Scorpio, and intrigued by sex, death and rebirth.” How does Lisa Boone’s plant horoscope know me so well? I’m Carolina A. Miranda, arts and urban design columnist at the Los Angeles Times, and my zodiac plant is the California poppy, and I’m here, feeling golden, with the week’s essential culture news:
Picturing the unseen
In 1990, my friend José Galvez, who was then working as a photographer for The Times, took me to UCLA to check out an exhibition at the university’s Wight Art Gallery. I had no idea what we were going to see, only that José had a couple of images in the show and that afterward we’d go grab dinner.
That exhibition ended up being transformative. “Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985,” known as CARA, was a traveling exhibition of art, photography and graphics — what was then one of the largest group shows ever dedicated to work by Chicano artists. On the lineup were key figures such as Judy Baca, Yolanda López, Gilbert “Magú"" Luján and Asco. I was particularly compelled by the photography, including portraiture, street photography and conceptual pieces by Ricardo Valverde, Harry Gamboa Jr. and, of course, José, who was showing images from the ’70s. I am not Chicana — I am South American — but in that exhibition I felt as if I was finally seeing, within the context of an art gallery, people whose culture, experiences and aesthetics in some way resembled mine. People whom I knew and saw every day in L.A.
I’ve thought a lot about CARA and the importance of presence as I’ve pored over issue No. 245 of Aperture magazine, which was guest edited by Pilar Tompkins Rivas, chief curator at the under-construction Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. The magazine, which is published by the Aperture Foundation, a New York-based arts organization devoted to showcasing photography in its gallery and in standalone publications, has taken for its most recent issue the theme of “Latinx.”
The issue is compelling for a lot of reasons, but it’s particularly insightful for the ways in which it highlights how Latino visual culture has been maintained not by institutions but by so many individuals. As Tompkins Rivas notes in her introduction, vernacular photography has played a critical role in recording a community whose presence in mainstream culture remains evanescent. When asked to edit the issue, she writes, “the first pictures that came to my mind were not the many artworks and documentary images that I have had the fortune of working with as a curator, but rather the personal photographs that have helped me piece together the story of my family’s history as Latinos in the United States.”
In recent years, archives amassed by Latinx artists have been key to illuminating aspects of American culture that have been overlooked elsewhere. I think of L.A. artists such as Guadalupe Rosales, whose Instagram account Veteranas and Rucas chronicles the ’90s party crew scene (she was covered in a 2018 issue of Aperture), or Vincent Ramos, who maintains an extensive archive of Latino themes in mass media. In the current issue, Ramos’ collection is highlighted over six pages, accompanied by an essay by LACMA curator Rita Gonzalez, and features everything from the El Pollo Loco chicken mascot to a member of the Monkees dressed up as a bandido. (I would love to hang out in his files.)"

Q&A with Sundance filmmaker Isabel Castro
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Last Friday, “Mija” premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary, the first feature for director Isabel Castro, focuses on Doris Muñoz, a talent manager in the music industry who got her break after helping launch the career of her childhood friend Omar Banos, better known as Cuco.
At its core, “Mija” is a film about what happens when your dreams come true and they have to coexist with your reality. Being Cuco’s manager has enabled Muñoz, an incredibly likable and charismatic character, to travel the world and have experiences that her undocumented family — she’s the only American citizen — could only dream of. Her work has also provided her with the financial means to not only support them, but also fund the green card applications of her parents so they can visit their oldest son, who was deported to Mexico years ago.
Yes, “Mija” is about immigration but it’s about so much more. It’s about the obligations and pressure the children of immigrants feel to do right by those who gave up so much for them. It’s about being the continuation of other people’s efforts, and the conflict that arises when you choose to forge a path that might differ from what’s expected of you.
On the heels of the film’s Sundance premiere, I spoke with director Isabel Castro. The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
Congrats on the premiere. How did this project come about?
I made my first film in college about transgender asylum seekers and after that experience, I began to grapple with how to continue doing this thing I loved in a way that felt pragmatic and stable, so I went into journalism for a really long time before coming back to independent filmmaking five years ago.
Throughout this time, I’ve been doing immigration coverage and storytelling. I wanted this film to tell the story of immigration in a way that felt different. Thematically and narratively, I didn’t just want to exclusively focus on the pain and trauma. Those things are inevitable and inherent to the experience, but I also wanted to spend more time exploring the more nuanced and complicated facets of it, to explore emotions like guilt and resentment and joy.
Also, I’ve always been a big music fan. I wanted to infuse entertainment into this story, and I thought that music would be a good way to do that.
Right. “Mija” is as much a music documentary as it is a story about immigration, and that it’s scored by Helado Negro kind of gives it this Latinx indie music street cred. How did you first connect with Doris Muñoz?
I came across an article in the California Sunday Magazine on Cuco. I was totally transfixed, obsessed with the idea of not just his music, but of the community. I didn’t grow up in California. I grew up in a really white part of the country. There was just something so exciting to me about what he represented to a younger version of myself. He had just signed a deal with Interscope Records, was touring the country, and in the process of all that, he was able to buy his previously undocumented parents a house.
I reached out to his manager, Doris, and in the course of talking to her I realized that she was an incredible character herself. I had this lightbulb go off in my head where I drew parallels between the film and music industries, where I realized that behind every correspondent or behind every musician, there’s this team that supports them. In those conversations, Doris mentioned that she herself was raising money and trying to get her family papers. She had started a concert series called Selena for Sanctuary, where she’d invite musicians like Helado Negro to cover Selena songs. The profits of those concerts initially went to paying for her parents’ legal fees and then ultimately ended up being fundraisers for different organizations. When she told me that her family was on the precipice of hearing back on whether their green card application had been successful, I knew that in and of itself could be the subject of a documentary film.
You know, it kind of struck me while watching it that “Mija” didn’t feel like a traditional documentary. It felt very dreamlike. The usage of home videos, the voice-over narration, the Helado Negro score, it all felt so intimate, like you were reading someone’s diary …
Thank you so much for saying that! It was very intentional. I really wanted to create a juxtaposition between dreams and real life, and to have those spaces intersect and overlap very purposefully.
There’s a scene in the movie that’s very painful to watch. It’s of Jacks Haupt, a musician from Texas signed by Muñoz, calling her undocumented parents to let them know that she’s talked to an immigration lawyer to start the green card process. It quickly goes off the rails. Can you talk to me about that scene?
I don’t want to give too much away because I want to kind of preserve a sense of mystery around it. What I will say is that Jacks’ story explores another facet of the challenge of being the daughter of immigrants. For Doris, it’s a lot more centered around the struggles of being your family’s breadwinner . For Jacks, her experience is that of someone whose parents and family were creating friction in terms of her pursuing her music dreams.
I could relate to that phone call, not because my parents weren’t supportive or I’ve had that call myself, but because as a child of immigrants you do have this unspoken pressure to go into a profession that is stable and that can pay the bills. A creative profession for children of immigrants can feel especially daunting.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer.
That’s the thing! Every time I talk to a Latinx journalist, they’re like, “I’ve had that phone call!” Our parents have sacrificed so much in order to come here. I don’t think people realize how sad and lonely life is when you’re separated from their family and the friends that they grew up with. And you know, it’s just challenging to want to honor that sacrifice and to make it worth their struggles too. Of course they’re like “be a lawyer!” or “be a doctor!” because that seems more stable than being a journalist, or a filmmaker, or a musician, or a music manager.
What has been the reception so far?
It’s been such, such a joy.
When we initially heard that Sundance was going to be virtual, I think we, along with probably everyone, were pretty disappointed because as a filmmaker you dream about going to festivals like Sundance your entire career. It’s such an incredible honor.
But pretty quickly we realized we had to figure out a way to celebrate this among ourselves. This is such a huge accomplishment for all of us. It’s my first feature film. It’s both my producers’ first feature film. And for Jacks and Doris, I just wanted them to feel like their vulnerability and the access they gave us were going to be celebrated and recognized. So we scrambled and put together an in-person screening the day of the premiere with friends and family. It was just so incredibly joyful to show the film to other people, because for the last three years, we’ve only been showing it to a small team of collaborators. It was so powerful to see how much it resonated with a young Latinx audience.
It’s the absolute highlight of my entire career to hear people say that they feel seen in this film because it was really important to me to create something that addressed some of the themes and questions that we all grapple with but don’t have proper representation of those stories on the screen.
The reception has been wonderful. It’s been more than I could have hoped for.
Speaking of representation, it’s hard to ignore the fact that Sundance isn’t really known for, well, that. What does it say that films like yours and Eva Longoria’s “La Guerra Civil” are finally being showcased at what’s considered to be a very prestigious film festival?
I feel like this is the beginning of a tide shift.
I do think that these festivals and platforms are trying to address the problem, but it’s crucial that they and we try hard as we can to do so. It’s incredible how much media influences our perception of ourselves and of the world that we live in. Sundance and pop culture in general are mirrors that reflect what society deems important and valuable, so it’s crucial that we see our own stories reflected back on to us.
The topic of representation has become increasingly popular, which is really encouraging. But I do think that there’s still a long way for us to go. I just hope that every year keeps getting not just more and more diverse, and that films like mine are not an exception to the rule, that they’re not talked about exclusively because of the value of it being a film about Latinxs made by a Latina. My hope is that these kinds of films will enter the mainstream and it’ll just be a given that they’ll be programmed because they’re good films.
It’s encouraging. But it’s also like it leaves me hungry for so much more."

Column: The term Latinx wasn’t made by ‘woke’ whites. Stop erasing its creators
BY JEAN GUERRERO

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) speaks at a news conference in Washington in April 2018. He has said on Twitter that he restricts his staff’s use of the term Latinx, claiming it’s meant to “appease white rich progressives.""
The dubious claim that the term Latinx is a creation of white liberal elites — one being vigorously promoted in right-wing circles — is gaining ground.
The campaign to police and ban one word has scored numerous wins in recent weeks: a flurry of editorials condemning the term and a ban on its use in official communications by the civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens.
“The reality is there is very little to no support for its use, and it’s sort of seen as something used inside the Beltway or in Ivy League tower settings,” LULAC President Domingo García told NBC.
This came after a poll showed only 2% of surveyed Latinos, mostly younger ones, identified as Latinx. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) declared on Twitter that he restricted his staff’s use of the term, claiming it’s meant to “appease white rich progressives.”
Such bans, understandably, alienate many of the LGBTQ, Indigenous and Black Latinxs whom the word was meant to represent. And although the term is imperfect and there are legitimate reasons to dislike it, the idea that it was invented by performative “woke” whites is wrong — and erases the voices that forged it as a path to visibility.
In the early 2000s, queer Latinxs began using the term on message boards and blogs. The trend accelerated after the 2016 massacre of 49 mostly queer Latinx people at Pulse, the Orlando nightclub. It built on the use of the machismo-resisting “Latin@s” or “Latino/a,” which pushed back against the Spanish language’s male-centric gendering. Latinx sought to cast an even wider net.
The “x” was already employed by many in Latin America to replace the male “o” and female “a” conjugations, yielding words such as “todxs,” meaning “everyone” in Portuguese and Spanish.
For some Latinos, particularly older ones, Latinx sounds weird. They find it hard to pronounce the “x” in English, though Spanish pronunciations of “Latin” and “x” can combine into a smooth “Latin-equis,” which rhymes with Dos Equis, the Mexican beer.
Others argue the term doesn’t do enough. Mexican historian and activist Citlalli Citlalmina Anahuac makes the case that both Latinx and Latino are anti-Indigenous, like the term Hispanic, often seen as centering Spanish colonizers. “The term ‘Latin’ is Eurocentric and centralizes whiteness,” she told me. “By adding an ‘x’ or an ‘e,’ we’re just playing with a colonial identity.”
But for many, Latinx feels like an important act of resistance against mainstream exclusion. Afro-Zapotec poet Alan Pelaez Lopez sees the “x” as symbolic of a wound, an important “reminder of the erasure of Black Latinxs,” among other traumas with which the community must reckon.
The letter “x” has a history in the civil rights movement as well. Latinx researcher Nicole Guidotti-Hernández points to Malcolm X, who adopted “X” to replace the white enslaver’s last name imposed on his family. She also points to Chicano civil rights activists who commonly replaced “ch” with “x” (Xicano instead of Chicano) as a nod to the Indigenous language Nahuatl.
Defenders of the term admit it isn’t perfect. Paola Ramos, a queer Latina and Vice News correspondent who wrote “Finding Latinx,” isn’t trying to force it on others. She just wants to normalize it. She gets inundated with hate and harassment for using the term — mostly from white, right-wing Latino men.
“When you’re a white Latino and you start seeing yourself next to a Black Latino, next to a transgender Latino, next to a queer Latino, next to an Indigenous Latino, you start to truly understand the diversity of our community,” she said. “That’s an image that a lot of people reject.”
Leslie Priscilla Arreola-Hillenbrand, who promotes nonviolent parenting through a group called Latinx Parenting, faces similar vitriol. “Latino men will follow me and come into my DMs specifically to cuss me out over the term in Spanish,” she told me.
She’s frustrated with how much oxygen the debate over a single word takes up when so many more critical issues exist in her community.
But that’s what right-wing campaigns are designed to do: distract from substantive problems. Last summer, while I was reporting on threats to brown and Black communities in California’s gubernatorial recall election, I used “Latinx” in a tweet.
An army of right-wing trolls began to quote-retweet me and attack me as being out of touch with my own community, triggering a flood of expletive-laden hate mail.
Giancarlo Sopo, a Spanish-language media advisor for Trump’s failed 2020 reelection bid, lumped me in with Democrats he accused of trying to force others to use the term, which he bizarrely likened to “a black market Viagra brand.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary Christina Pushaw chimed in, sarcastically urging Florida Democrats to adopt the term. Even Fox News turned my tweet into a story.
The desire to dictate how Latinos can identify and exist comes predominantly from the right. But exceptions do exist. Tanya K. Hernández, an Afro-Latina of my mother’s generation and author of a forthcoming book on anti-Blackness among Latinos, says she’s had editors and colleagues — even some white ones — tell her she should default to the word Latinx, which doesn’t come naturally to her, even though she is not opposed to its use. She gently but firmly declines.
“People should have the right to describe themselves in the ways they find most appropriate,” she argues. Plus, she told me: “I’d rather talk substance as opposed to the formalities of the proper etiquette or the proper word on a particular day. We still have children at the border. We still have people in immigration detention centers. Let’s talk about that.”
Perhaps the debate about a word wouldn’t generate so much heat if it weren’t cast as either/or. Latinx strives for inclusivity. We don’t need to be pitted against one another, Latino versus Latinx. That’s exactly what far-right forces would like. Don’t fall for it."

How a butterfly sanctuary became a victim of the border debate
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

The Rio Grande is for the birds.
And for the butterflies.
It’s true. The borderland region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is considered to be “a birdwatcher’s paradise” where more than 500 species have been documented. The presence of these majestic creatures is so ubiquitous that you can find great egrets just casually chilling in the water hazards of a public disc golf course.
The area also boasts the National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre former onion field in Mission, Texas, that has been transformed into a sanctuary where more than 200 types of butterflies have been spotted. It is an idyllic place that sits next to the heavily politicized and militarized river.
For the last few years, the center has also become the target of harassment from right-wing extremists because of a conspiracy theory that claims it is being used for child trafficking.
On Tuesday, the board of the North American Butterfly Assn., which oversees the preserve, announced that it was shutting down the National Butterfly Center indefinitely because of security and safety concerns.
How exactly did a space dedicated to the study and preservation of the lepidoptera land in the crosshairs of far-right extremists?
You have Brian Kolfage to blame for that. Kolfage was one of the organizers behind the anti-immigrant group We Build the Wall, which crowdfunded millions of dollars for a private wall along the U.S./Mexico border.
In November 2019, the group began clearing the land next to the private nature preserve to build its wall. The National Butterfly Center opposed the pending construction, citing that it violated international treaties and would be ecologically detrimental to their property. That’s when the attacks began. Kolfage took to Twitter to disparage the group, accusing it of aiding in human and insect smuggling.
The following month, the National Butterfly Center obtained a temporary restraining order against Kolfage and We Build the Wall, and filed a suit claiming defamation.
In 2020, Kolfage, former Donald Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon and two others were federally charged for allegedly using part of the money to enrich themselves. The Northwest Florida Daily News also reported in September that lawyers representing Kolfage in the conservancy group‘s lawsuit had been granted permission by a federal judge to withdraw their representation, citing lack of payment.
The attacks against the National Butterfly Center have not stopped. Mariana Treviño Wright, the executive director, recently told Buzzfeed News last week that harassment had begun to “ramp back up” in the lead up to a pro-Trump rally in nearby McAllen that took place over the weekend. On Friday, the Daily Beast reported that fringe congressional candidate Kimberly Lowe and another woman claiming to be with the Secret Service showed up unannounced and got involved in an altercation with Treviño Wright and her son. The cops were called, but the police didn’t show up until an hour later.
Dr. Jeffrey Glassberg, president and founder of the North American Butterfly Assn., said the center will reopen “when the authorities and professionals who are helping us navigate this situation give us the green light.”
Until that happens, the residents of the Rio Grande Valley, one of the most impoverished but culturally rich parts of the country (Puro 956 cuh!), will be deprived of a place that highlights the area’s natural beauty. All because a bunch of unhinged people who don’t even live there believed a lie told by a man who has been federally indicted.
That to me is the real tragedy taking place at the border, not the politically motivated fabrication that makes the news every time Republicans want to kill meaningful immigration reform."

Letters to the Editor: Why the Spanish languages makes it so hard for Latinx to catch on

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) has criticized use of of the word “Latinx” instead of Latino.
To the editor: No matter who is promoting the use of Latinx, it is unlikely to become widely accepted in the long term. There is good reason for the general lack of awareness of the term and for resistance to its adoption, especially among native speakers of Spanish.
The push to use Latinx is apparently due to the false assumption that the “o” in Latino denotes exclusively masculine gender. It does not.
Depending on context, it may refer to males or to any and all people described. In the same way that los Mexicanos does not refer only to male Mexicans, or that los ricos does not refer only to male rich people, Latinos can refer to people of any gender.
Nouns have gender in Spanish, but they do not always reflect the gender of the people they may refer to. Individuo is always a masculine noun, even if it refers to a female individual. Persona is always a feminine noun, even if it refers to a male person.
It is virtually impossible to impose language use. Words and rules evolve within the community of speakers. Time will tell if speakers generally adopt Latinx, but we doubt it.
Ronald M. Harmon and María R. Montaño-Harmon, Brea
Harmon is a professor emeritus of Spanish and Portuguese at Cal State Fullerton, where Montaño-Harmon is an associate professor emeritus of secondary education.
To the editor: I appreciate columnist Jean Guerrero’s opinion regarding the term Latinx, but I disagree with it.
Guerrero disputes the common criticism that the term was created by “woke” whites, but I can easily tell her that it was most definitely not created in the barrio, where most of la gente reside, nor was it created in any Latin American country.
Spanish, the language that helps us Latinos keep our customs, culture, ideas and relationships alive in an increasingly English-dominant world, is a gendered language. We identify as Latinos, celebrate la cultura Mexicana and pay homage to la patria that stretches from Tijuana to Patagonia. We listen to la radio, go to el cine, wake up in la mañana and party at las fiestas.
At a time when we like to celebrate diversity, the Spanish language already has diverse terms built in for gender, and as a result helps foster the compassionate, colorful future that we all want to have. We Latinos and Latinas are here to pave the way.

Podcasts made by and for Latinos finally make mainstream inroads
BY SUZY EXPOSITO

Southeast L.A. native Erick Galindo wanted to make a podcast that his Mexican parents would enjoy.
Galindo, 38, was already an award-winning writer and documentarian when he made his podcasting debut in 2020 as co-creator of “Wild” for LAist Studios, the podcast division of Southern California Public Radio.
But it wasn’t until the Feb. 1 release of “Ídolo: The Ballad of Chalino Sánchez” — a bilingual murder mystery that examines the freewheeling life and death of the beloved regional Mexican folk legend — that Galindo’s mom set her phone down on the kitchen counter one night and, as she washed the dishes, listened to her very first podcast.
“Chalino lived a few blocks away from where we lived when I was a kid,” says Galindo, whose family immigrated to California from Sinaloa, Mexico, then migrated all over Southeast L.A. before settling in Downey in the 1990s. “He was an outlaw. His music captured this microcosm of L.A. during that time, the same way Biggie Smalls did for Brooklyn.”
Hosted and reported by Galindo in English and by Mexican journalist Alejandro Mendoza in Spanish, the eight-episode “Ballad of Chalino Sánchez” recounts the story of the “godfather of narcocorridos,” or drug ballads, with the gripping tension of a vintage radio noir. Sánchez, known for smuggling migrants and tangling with the Sinaloan drug cartels, sang songs about their dirty deeds for years, until one night in 1992 he was shot and killed after a concert in Culiacán. Thirty years later, his murder remains unsolved.
Produced in collaboration with Latin multimedia companies Sonoro and Futuro Studios, this podcast is the first of several installments of “Ídolo,” a Sonoro series dedicated to Latin pop culture icons. It’s also the latest in a spate of buzzy Latin music podcasts that have emerged over the last year, from “Loud: The History of Reggaeton” to “Anything for Selena.”
And as Latin music’s popularity balloons well beyond the Hispanic community, podcasters see opportunities for additional growth. As examples, see the recent popularity surge of the soundtrack for Disney’s 2021 movie “Encanto,” which has spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, or Bad Bunny’s upcoming stadium tour, El ´Ultimo Tour del Mundo, which became the fastest tour to sell out on Ticketmaster since 2018.
“We’re bringing to life so many stories from Latinx writers who typically wouldn’t have their ideas developed by Hollywood, because they wouldn’t be taken seriously despite the huge audience demand for Latinx content,” says Camila Victoriano, co-founder and head of partnerships at Sonoro. After she helped develop audio programming at the L.A. Times, including the smash 2017 podcast “Dirty John,” Victoriano co-founded Sonoro with an all-Latino crew composed of former producers from the Walt Disney Company and Gimlet Media. Sonoro currently has 10 of the top 100 podcasts in Latin America, including the No. 1 Spanish-language podcast in the world, “Leyendas Legendarias,” a comedy series that riffs on true crime and the paranormal.
“The storytellers we support today can become the media and entertainment industry leaders of tomorrow,” she says.
Hosts of today’s most popular podcasts in the U.S. skew largely white and/or Anglophone. At the top of both Apple’s and Spotify’s podcasts charts, “My Favorite Murder” and “Serial” contend with established news programs like NBC’s “Dateline” and the New York Times’ “The Daily,” along with conservative-centered talk shows from Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan. In 2015, an internal study conducted by NPR reported that 67% of people who listened to its podcasts were white.
Since the Hispanic and/or Latino population in the U.S. reached 62.1 million in 2020 — up from 50.5 million in 2010, according to the Pew Research Report — podcasters have an incentive to better captivate listeners from these communities, as Galindo did his parents.
“For so long, podcasts have been envisioned and created for this very small group of white, affluent people,” says Marlon Bishop, vice president of podcasts at Futuro Studios, the new creative wing of Futuro Media Group. Based in New York City, the nonprofit multimedia news organization was founded in 2010 by journalist Maria Hinojosa, host of “Latino USA,” the longest-running national Latino news program on public radio.
As “Latino USA” accumulated a sizable audience through NPR, Futuro expanded its digital footprint by partnering with the politics website Latino Rebels and, later, producing limited series like the 2020 podcast “Anything for Selena.” In an artful fusion of investigative journalism and memoir, host Maria Garcia spliced critical analysis of the Tejano singer’s cultural and commercial afterlife with memories from her own girlhood in El Paso, told in both English and Spanish.
“People tell us how the Spanish versions helped their families connect with their interests,” says Garcia, now an executive editor at Futuro Studios. “It’s wonderful that my mom can understand the work I’m doing.”
Garcia was a senior editor at WBUR, the public radio station in Boston, when she first pitched “Anything for Selena” to NPR in 2017. Futuro, as it turned out, pitched NPR on a Selena podcast as well. Instead of dividing the attentions of their audience with competing podcasts, the producers joined forces.
“What we do is still relatively new and we’re still building our audience,” says Futuro’s Bishop. “There’s no point in being super competitive at this time, in this industry.”
Julio A. Pabón, executive producer of video at Spotify Studios, took notice of Futuro’s increasing dominion over all things Latino in the audio space. In 2019, he proposed a deal with Futuro to co-create the podcast that became “Loud: The History of Reggaeton.” Hosted by Ivy Queen, the genre’s Puerto_Rican matriarch, “Loud” provided a master class on what is perhaps the most misunderstood yet lucrative art form in Latin America today — as told by Ivy and her peers in a fluid, uniquely Caribbean mélange of English, Spanish and Jamaican patois.
“On Spotify alone, 328 million listeners streamed at least one reggaeton song in 2020, and we counted over 3.6 billion hours of reggaeton streamed in that same year,” Pabón says. “‘Loud’ charted in Australia, Canada, Spain, Great Britain, Mexico, Panama and, of course, the United States. For a music podcast, that’s a major win.”
Yet as Latin American stories gain traction not just in the States but on global platforms like Spotify, the question of how to responsibly represent these ethnic groups can be a daunting one. Creators express anxiety over painting their cultures with too broad a brush.
“While working on ‘Chalino,’ some people were like, ‘Do we want to tell another narco story?’” says Galindo. “Of course it’s unfortunate that most stories we hear about Latinos involve criminals. But if David Chase got to make six seasons of ‘The Sopranos,’ we should have space to talk about people we grew up with, and the complexities of their humanity. When people say I can’t rep my culture because it doesn’t rep everyone? That’s how they keep our stories out of the mainstream.”
“History is a story, and it’s not necessarily a positive one,” says reggaeton historian and podcaster Katelina Eccleston, who consulted on “Loud” and conducted artist interviews, placing special emphasis on the genre’s Black and working-class origins. “In the end I may not like J Balvin’s politics,” she adds, “but he is important to reggaeton history.”
Still, the international success of “Selena,” “Loud” and similar podcasts has inspired other studios to follow suit.
Last June, industry giant iHeartMedia debuted My Cultura, its Latin podcast network, with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights” explainer “El Sueñito,” followed by reggaeton deep dive “El Flow” and talk show “Chiquis and Chill,” hosted by banda-pop singer Chiquis Rivera.
Audible, in partnership with new podcast firm Fresh Produce Media, plans to release a bilingual Latin music series in the spring titled “Punk in Translation: Latinx Origins,” an eight-part audio documentary chronicling punk rock’s Latin American roots, starting with ’60s garage rockers Los Saicos and the band known as ? and the Mysterians, progressing to the punks of present day. Hosted by Tijuana No! vocalist Ceci Bastida, the podcast will feature interviews with such luminaries as Joan Jett, Julieta Venegas, Alice Bag, the Dead Kennedys’ Jello Biafra and more.
“Hopefully podcasting is going to be a place where the rest of the entertainment and media industry, for that matter, realize that they need to catch up,” says Gustavo Arellano, L.A. Times columnist and host of “The Times” podcast. Although he entered the realm of radio as a generalist, one of his most popular episodes, he notes, was a 2021 special on Vicente Fernandez, the late King of Ranchera.
“Latinos can make successful products, and we can make successful products about Latinos,” he adds. “So let’s invest in our stories.”"

The rise of the Latinx creator
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

This week, the Los Angeles Times published two stories on Latinx creators that caught my attention.
The first was written by Suzy Exposito and focused on the mainstream success of music podcasts like “Ídolo: The Ballad of Chalino Sánchez” and “LOUD: The History of Reggaeton.”
The second was written by technology reporter Brian Contreras and focused on the Latinx TikTok house Familia Fuego.
What I love about these stories is that they validate a fundamental belief shared by those involved in the production of this newsletter: There is an audience hungry to consume media that center on us.
(The Latinx Files is a group effort, and I’d like to give a shoutout to my editor Angel Rodriguez, our creative director Martina Ibañez-Baldor, and multiplatform editor Elvia Limón, who makes sure this newsletter makes it to your inbox every Thursday.)
“We’re bringing to life so many stories from Latinx writers who typically wouldn’t have their ideas developed by Hollywood, because they wouldn’t be taken seriously despite the huge audience demand for Latinx content,” says Camila Victoriano, co-founder of Sonoro, which co-produced “Ídolo” with Futuro Studios.
She’s not wrong about the demand.
When “Ídolo” came out, my Twitter timeline was filled with tweets praising the podcast for telling the fascinating story of a performer so iconic he’s referred to simply by his first name. It was one of our stories told exactly the way it should have been told.
And while TikTokers like Alexia Del Valle and Leo González might not be huge stars, their videos are shared by millions of people who see themselves in them. (Case in point: that feeling when you wanted Bad Bunny tickets but couldn’t afford them.)
“Our demo is here,” González said of Los Angeles, where the Familia Fuego house is located. “Whenever we go to any sort of public place where it’s Latinos … we all have people there who know us.”
There’s value in that recognition. As Brian notes in his story, the Latinx content house is partially funded by DirecTV. What these TikTokers give the telecommunications company is access to a demographic that’s “notoriously hard to reach through traditional channels,” according to chief marketing officer Vince Torres.
It’s easy to feel discouraged about the lack of Latinx representation in media, but these types of stories offer a semblance of a silver lining. They highlight that there is indeed a path forward.
“Latinos can make successful products, and we can make successful products about Latinos,” said Gustavo Arellano, Times columnist and host of the Ambie-nominated “The Times” podcast.
“So let’s invest in our stories.”"

‘West Side Story’ star Ariana DeBose makes LGBTQ+, Latinx history at SAG Awards
BY CHRISTI CARRAS

“West Side Story” breakout Ariana DeBose is the first openly queer woman and the first Latina performer to win an individual film prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
The rising movie star received the film honor for supporting actress for her powerful turn as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story.” She prevailed over fellow nominees Caitríona Balfe (“Belfast”), Cate Blanchett (“Nightmare Alley”), Kirsten Dunst (“The Power of the Dog”) and Ruth Negga (“Passing”).
Earlier this month, DeBose also landed her first Oscar nomination for her emotional performance as Anita, and became the first openly queer woman of color nominated for an acting Oscar.
DeBose and “Spencer” star Kristen Stewart also became the first openly queer performers nominated for an Oscar since Ian McKellen in 2002 for “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.” Though he did not win the Oscar, McKellen did win the supporting actor SAG Award that year, making him the only other out actor to win an individual film prize from the actors guild.
“We here! And we queer,” DeBose said to Entertainment Tonight at the SAG Awards red carpet. “It is exciting and I’m very proud of these moments because I think they’re indicative of the fact that they will not be the last.”
“That’s how I choose to look at them and it’s like, if we can have these conversations around me, that just means the door is open, so come on in.”
While “West Side Story” was otherwise shut out of SAG Award nominations, the Disney and 20th Century Studios release garnered a total of seven Academy Award nominations, including nods for director, cinematography, costume design and best picture."

Where do we live?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

One of the biggest takeaways from the 2020 U.S. Census was that Latinxs were responsible for more than half of the U.S. population growth over the last decade. The findings of the decennial count revealed that we now account for 18.7% of the total population, or roughly 62.1 million people.
But have you wondered where exactly Latinxs live?
Last month, the Pew Research Center published a report that does a really great job at answering this question.
Some of the findings are obvious.
For example, a lot of Latinxs live in Southern California. Five of the 10 counties with the largest Latinx populations were in the region — Los Angeles (4.8 million people), Riverside (1.2 million) , San Bernardino (1.17 million), San Diego (1.11 million) and Orange (1.08 million). Altogether, these counties are home to roughly 15% of the total U.S. Latinx population.
Similarly, the five non-California counties on the list — Harris County, Texas (2.03 million); Miami-Dade County, Fla. (1.85 million); Cook County, Ill. (1.38); Maricopa County, Ariz. (1.35 million); Bexar County, Texas (1.19 million) — are all “metropolitan counties with historically Hispanic populations,” including places such as Houston, Miami and Chicago. (As a side note, I was genuinely surprised to see the absence of any New York counties on this list.)
But Pew’s analysis of census data also found that more and more Latinxs are popping up in unexpected places. Like North Dakota, for instance.
The Flickertail State (yes, I had to look that up, along with “flickertail,” which is apparently a type of rodent) saw a bigger increase in its Latinx population (148%) than any other. Why are Latinxs moving there? My best guess is that people are going where the jobs are. Over the last 10 years, the Latinx populations of McKenzie and Williams counties increased by 1,002% and 794%, respectively. Both are also big oil producers.
“The U.S. Latino population has been shifting away from states with historically large Latino populations for decades,” the authors of the Pew report note.
“As recently as 1990, 86% of Latinos lived in just nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Texas). Although the Latino population has grown in each of these states, their share of all U.S. Latinos had dropped to 73% by 2020.”
Pardon me for sounding like a broken record, but this report really drives home the point that Latinxs are not a monolith. Our experiences are our own, and the places we call home play a crucial role in shaping them.
You can find the complete Pew Research Center study, which includes detailed maps, here.
Also, if you’re a Latinx living in North Dakota, or in another non-traditionally Latinx part of the country, hit me up (latinxfiles@latimes.com) because I very much want to talk to you."

Op-Ed: Silicon Valley’s huge diversity problem holds tech back
BY ADRIANA GASCOIGNE

The “nerds will rule the world” trope was inspirational for kids like me in the 1980s, a cliche in the 1990s, an ascendant notion in the 2000s, and today it’s canon. Silicon Valley emerged as the nerds’ triumphant new world of possibility where glasses, acne, poor social skills and other comic stereotypes become irrelevant — brilliant ideas win the day on merit alone.
But the reality of this supposedly new social order is largely more of the same. Even with diversity as an established corporate buzzword in 2022, one of the most lucrative industries in the world is still run almost entirely by white men.
Over nearly 20 years working in tech, I haven’t gone a day without being reminded that I’m in the minority as a woman and a Latina. Early in my career, a male co-worker sent me a graphic, sexual message on corporate email. When I reported the incident to the HR and legal departments, he faced no consequences while I got moved to an isolated part of the office, paying the price for speaking up. It became clear my identity would shape my professional life whether I wanted it to or not.
Undeterred, I stayed and made my mark before moving on to a new startup. I built a network of peers and sought counsel outside of my employers. I often quietly worked with women at competitors to chart a way through Silicon Valley’s Wild West workplaces. I’m fortunate to have found amazing mentors, who also were de facto therapists.
The problem is that I had to piece together this network myself and in my spare time, rather than having diverse mentorship built into the companies where I worked.
This is an industrywide problem: Among Silicon Valley’s largest companies, the percentage of Hispanic/Latinx employees working in technology positions is still absurdly low. Apple, the largest tech company, reports that 8% of its U.S. tech workforce identified as Hispanic/Latinx in 2020. At Microsoft, that number is 7%. Google has more detailed data, but it’s depressing: Just 1.8% of its global tech workforce identifies as female and Hispanic/Latinx. In contrast, Hispanic/Latinx people compose 19% of the overall U.S. population and, crucially, 51% of America’s population growth between 2010 and 2020.
Startups are judged in large part on founders’ bona fides with the “big five” — Apple, Microsoft and Google as well as Facebook and Amazon — and their experience with the industry titans can be a key determinant in getting venture capital. Consequently, the lack of representation at the big five drives disparities across the industry.
Many U.S. sectors have had to confront their lack of diversity and inclusion, but it represents a particular disconnect in tech. The industry generally sees itself as supportive of gender and racial equity and politically progressive — more than 75% of the big five employees’ political donations in 2020 went to Democratic candidates, for example. And the ethos behind tech is progress and change, which is particularly incongruous with such disappointing demographics.
A lack of diversity hurts products and services as well as company culture and performance. Diverse companies are better able to adapt and thrive as consumer populations change. Companies close to gender parity for top-ranking positions earn up to 50% higher profits than companies with fewer female executives.
And homogeneity creates awful, sometimes dangerous results. Take, for example, artificial intelligence using white-centric facial recognition that labels Black people as “primates” in a video recommendation, disproportionately flagging Black users’ tweets for deletion and algorithmic bias that puts minority pedestrians at greater risk from self-driving cars. When I worked at one social networking startup, a user in a Spanish-speaking country was kidnapped based on information from his profile. As the only person in the company who spoke Spanish and understood important cultural norms, I had to become the police liaison and offer security and privacy recommendations. I’m not sure what would have happened to the kidnapped person without me there.
After working at 12 startups, and witnessing a lack of diversity at every one, I founded Girls in Tech with a singular mission: to end the gender gap in tech by institutionalizing the same networking opportunities that helped me. The organization now has 80,000 members across 57 chapters in 42 countries. I work daily with leaders of America’s tech scene. Yet still, I rarely find someone in the room who looks like me.
Tech has to do better by making real changes, specifically at the top. While increased hiring of nonwhite, nonmale lower-level employees is positive, companies shouldn’t point to those stats for good press while hiding the lack of diversity in their boardrooms where big decisions get made. And the project management process that drives tech development must be overhauled to include input from underrepresented groups from early stages to execution, with accountability for business leaders who fail to bring diverse voices into projects.
Simple changes can make a world of difference. Twitter’s work-from-anywhere policies and a “Rooney rule” — taken from the NFL’s (imperfect and now embattled) requirement for teams to interview minority candidates for top positions — helped to increase its Black and Latinx workforce in the U.S., boosting the latter to 8% in 2021 from 5.5% in 2020.
That’s more proof that we don’t have to stick with the status quo in tech. If more boardrooms took notice, brilliant ideas might truly win the day."

A Latinx playwright hopes he never has to write another play like ‘The Play You Want’
BY NIKKI MUNOZ

The protagonist of “The Play You Want,” premiering March 11 at the Road Theatre in North Hollywood, is a Mexican playwright named Bernardo Cubría, played by Peter Pasco. Weary from constant rejections, he sarcastically pitches a play about drug dealers on Día de los Muertos called “Nar-cocos.” To Cubría’s surprise, the play is picked up.
A hesitant Cubría eventually agrees to have the play produced, due to mounting financial pressures. He gradually becomes enamored with the attention he begins receiving from the play, as well as his rising trajectory as a playwright — despite the content of “Nar-cocos.”
The real playwright behind “The Play You Want,” also named Bernardo Cubría, shares a similar history of rejection with his onstage counterpart — hence the meta subject matter.
In late 2019, Cubría received a rejection from a Latinx theater festival. The reasoning? His play, an existentialist endeavor exploring “how communities can be [their] own worst enemies” through the perspective of crabs living in a bucket (aptly titled “Crabs in a Bucket”), didn’t feature any “Latinx themes,” according to the rejection letter. He was devastated. “I was shocked at how upset I was,” Cubría recalls. “But I was really sad more than anything because I thought, ‘I’m Mexican, so doesn’t that make anything I write Latinx?’”
While Cubría has had his plays produced in small theaters, he says he has faced adversity in trying to get a yes from bigger “establishment theaters.” After being rejected by the Latinx theater festival, something shifted within Cubría; he viewed it as “the last straw,” because it had come from the Latinx community. That same night, Cubría sat down at his computer. “Around 10 p.m., my wife and son were asleep and I opened a bottle of tequila and I started typing,” he says. “And around 4 a.m. I had the first draft of this play.”
Cubría initially thought of “The Play You Want” less like a stage play and more as a cathartic diary entry. It’s starkly different from what he usually writes, with most of his plays — including “The Giant Void in My Soul” and “The Judgment of Fools” — circling existentialist themes. This new work represents a leap for the playwright. “It still frightens me to death, this play, because it is very, very personal,” he says. “But all the writers I love say to write what scares you, so I thought, OK, I’m going to do that now.”
The main character wasn’t always named Bernardo Cubría. In its original iteration, his name was Lucas. “The person I believe I’m making fun of the most in this play is me,” explains Cubría. “I wanted to take myself head on and satirize myself for not just being OK with just the validation of my wonderful wife and beautiful son, and [instead] seeking this external validation from these people who see Mexicans as two-dimensional. And there’s something really funny and painful about that.”
Cubría is not the only character in the play who shares a name with a real person — in “The Play You Want,” the protagonist finds himself offered a Broadway run by none other than Scott Rudin, the powerful film and theater producer accused of abusive behavior by former staff members last year. Cubría says he wrote Rudin into the play before the allegations were made public.
“I had heard stories in the theater world about Scott Rudin and the way he treated people,” he says. “But to be honest, it’s not about him. It’s about the machine of Broadway and the things that they ask writers of color to do to be accepted by a larger audience.”
Considering Cubría’s history of difficulty finding homes for his plays, he was surprised when the Road Theatre was immediately interested. “I didn’t know that the Road would be interested in that because it’s not a company that is run by Latinx people, but they loved it from the beginning,” he says. “It has been really amazing to see how supportive they’ve been, especially because the play takes on a lot of the establishment of the theater.”
Taylor Gilbert, the founder and co-artistic director of the Road Theatre Company, says she was taken with how the story “cuts to the quick of relevant issues with humor and heart.”
Cubría says the American theater still expects only “issue plays” from writers of color, such as his play-within-a-play, “Nar-cocos.” With “The Play You Want,” he hopes to compel audience members to think about why Mexican writers often are encouraged to write about their “pain and suffering” instead of penning stories about everyday life, or anything else an artist of color wants to tackle through their work. “It’s so painful to us that [our suffering] is the only part of our existence that people want to hear about. I’m exhausted by it,” says Cubría. “Especially now as a father, I want my son to have content that is about our people but is about us just being kids, or parents, or lovers, or best friends.”
Despite being proud of what he’s accomplished with “The Play You Want,” Cubría describes it as a “necessary evil” — a step he needed to take to move forward as a playwright, even though it’s completely different from what he would like to be writing. “I have mixed feelings about this play because I like it, and I think it’s really funny, but I also think it proves the point of the play in that this is the play that has gotten awards and attention because it is an issue play,” Cubría says. “I hope that I never choose to write another play like this again.”"

The queer Latina superhero noir novel Alex Segura had to write
BY PAULA L. WOODS

Set in 1975 during a particularly low point in the comics industry, Alex Segura’s “Secret Identity” is the genre-defying story of Carmen Valdez, a 20-something comic book fan from Miami who comes into her power, both on and off the page, through the Legendary Lynx, the superhero comic she creates at a New York City comic book company.
Budding authors are often advised to write the book only they can write. It’s one of those truisms that is so much easier said than done, but in Segura’s case, at this point in his singular career, it is most certainly true.
Segura, 41, was born in Miami during a fertile period for comics. Art Spiegelman’s comic strip “Maus,” published the year Segura was born, was collected into a Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel when Segura was 10. By the time he entered college, Michael Chabon’s “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,” about two World War II-era comics creators, had earned the Pulitzer Prize and deep-thinking cartoonists such as Chris Ware and Ben Katchor were winning major awards and fellowships. But Segura’s lifelong fascination with the genre started long before it became cool. It began with, of all things, an Archie digest his mother bought him when he was 5 (“to shut me up, I’m sure”).
“Comics are how I first learned to connect pictures to words,” he explains during a recent Zoom call from his home in Brooklyn, N.Y. “I would relate what was happening in my life through the prism of comics.” The son of Cuban immigrants who fled in the aftermath of the Castro revolution, Segura uses his hands as he conveys his youthful love of the Tim Burton-directed “Batman” and his dreams of a Spider-Man film that would bring the teenage Peter Parker to life.
It was far from his only bookish obsession. “I picked up a copy of ‘The Godfather’ at a too-young age from my grandfather’s library in Little Havana,” he recalls, “which probably sparked my love of crime fiction.” College broadened his reading horizons — introducing Ernest Hemingway, Margaret Atwood, Agatha Christie and John le Carré, among others. This too primed him for an age when comics went highbrow and genre began to infuse literature.
“If it entertained, I read it.” He also had a strong affinity for Chabon’s early work. “‘The Mysteries of Pittsburgh’ was a game-changing read,” he notes, “and I loved ‘The Wonder Boys.’” But comics remained a mainstay in Segura’s reading life, so when “Kavalier & Clay” came out in 2000, it was a revelation. “I was riding the bus between classes,” he remembers, “reading about the Escapist (the superhero Kavalier and Clay create). I really wanted to read that comic within the book, along with the story of its creators.”
Segura’s enthusiasm is palpable as he sets the scene. “One of the first short stories I ever attempted in a writing class was about a comic book employee who discovers a lost superhero.” And while he confesses that first attempt was forgettable, “the idea of telling a story within comics was always in the back of my mind.”
Like Peter Parker and Clark Kent, he started off in newspapers, but after a job at the Miami Herald proved unfulfilling, Segura sought freelance gigs interviewing and writing about the comics creators he admired. Drawn deeper into their world, Segura relocated to Gotham; he spent more than a decade in publicity, marketing and editorial at industry heavyweights like DC Comics. At Archie Comic Publications, he ended up co-authoring Archie comics that introduced superhero elements to the venerable franchise, as well as several “Archie Meets” crossover comics featuring cameos by the Ramones and the B-52s.
Once again he found himself blazingly on-trend; in 2017, the TV series “Riverdale” retooled the Archie-verse into a dark teen drama. “I never thought we’d live in a world where we’d have movies and shows for these characters,” he says, adding that he’s a fan of the show. “We felt blessed, when I was a kid, to see a Batman movie or rumors of a new Spider-Man film. But the content is everywhere now.”
While immersed in comics and their evolution, Segura was also devouring modern PI novels — Laura Lippman, Dennis Lehane, George Pelecanos, but also Latinx crime writers like Carolina Garcia-Aguilera. Eventually, Segura’s “hobby reading” inspired him to try his hand at the genre, which blossomed into a series of five mysteries featuring Pete Fernandez, a Cuban American private investigator in Miami. Yet for all the acclaim and awards the books received, Segura thinks of them now as building blocks toward the ultimate hybrid, “Secret Identity.”
“I think as writers, we know when we’re ready to hit that level, and I felt like I needed to get my sea legs by writing mysteries. I needed to respect the tropes and learn how to invert them in a way that felt natural. By the end of the series, I felt confident enough that I could revisit my comic book in a novel idea.”
That confidence was shared by Zachary Wagman, the vice president and editorial director of Flatiron Books, who heard his idea as they sat together during a mystery convention breakfast. “I love a good crime novel and I’m a longtime comic book reader,” Wagman said in an email. “To have the two intertwined, by a writer of Alex’s talents, was just too good to be true.” Segura’s manuscript “far exceeded my hopes. It had that masterful hard-boiled voice but mixed with this wide-eyed love for comics. That’s an extremely tricky needle to thread.”
Valdez is in some ways deeply autobiographical — except, of course, she’s a woman and she’s queer. To do her justice, Segura dove into memoirs by writers like Carmen Maria Machado and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel and engaged “sensitivity readers” who offered Segura feedback. His diligent approach follows the advice of writers such as Alexander Chee, who, amid the recent debate about depicting “others” outside of an author’s experience, suggested that anyone still at a loss for how to depict such characters “probably has not done the reading.”
Segura has done the work: Carmen is a vibrant, kinetic character who, like Segura, has relocated to New York City from Miami to pursue her dream of a career in comics while finding her authentic self. She lands at Triumph Comics, not as a writer or editor (it’s 1975), but as secretary to the CEO, who makes it clear he’s never going to give Carmen a shot at writing a comic. So when a nebbish-y colleague, Harvey Stern, approaches her to collaborate on a story, Carmen pours her heart and soul into the Legendary Lynx. Soon, she learns Harvey has submitted the story without her name attached. Before she can confront him, Harvey is murdered and Carmen is investigating the crime, as much to clear her name as regain control over her creation.
“Secret Identity” is a magnetic read, its plotline as engaging as anything DC or Marvel could create. Its focus on marginalized women creators evokes trailblazers like Trina Robbins and even bit players like Patricia Highsmith, who wrote a wartime comic before “Strangers on a Train” and the Ripley novels.
It’s also a deep dive into an industry at its lowest ebb. “I wanted to spotlight an era when comics weren’t as prevalent or as popular as they are today,” Segura says. “In 1975, comics were a fading industry. They weren’t seen as a path to film or television or something more lucrative. … The entire enterprise felt very shaky.”
Segura is ready to move on from that era, but not from his new, not-so-secret identity. He has signed with Flatiron for a second book, a sequel set in the modern day “featuring some of the key characters from the first novel and another, new protagonist” in a noir version of this very moment. In other words, a world in which superheroes are thriving, the Legendary Lynx among them."

Are we ready for a ‘computerized’ Selena album?
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Nearly 27 years after her death, a new Selena album is in the works.
In an interview with “Latin Groove News,” Abraham Quintanilla, the father of the deceased Tejana icon and a person known in fandom circles for his penchant for sending cease-and-desist letters, announced his family was collaborating with Warner Music to put out a 13-track record.
It’s truly a family affair. Son A.J. is producing and daughter Suzette is working on the album art.
According to Quintanilla, some of the tracks will have the vocals of a young Selena digitally altered to sound older.
“What’s unique about it is that not only is the music completely new arrangements, but my son worked on Selena’s voice with the computers and if you listen to her, she sounds on this recording like she did right before she passed away,” he told host Jose Rosario.
I have to admit that despite the unprecedented times we’ve been living through, I didn’t have “Selena robot album” on my 2022 bingo card.
No one can truly know what Selena would have wanted — that’s the trouble with stars who die before their time, all the “what ifs?” — but I can’t imagine it would be this.
It’s also hard to ignore the timing of the announcement.
The San Antonio Express-News reported in September that the Quintanilla family and Chris Perez, Selena’s widower, had settled their legal dispute over control of the artist’s estate. (To learn more about the legal battle, I recommend this 2020 Billboard story by Jesse Katz.)
I don’t know the Quintanillas personally nor do I know what’s in their heart or what they’ve been through, but the ethical implications of it all make me deeply uncomfortable as a lifetime fan of Selena’s music.
It feels like we’re two steps away from a near future in which a hologram Selena is closing out a Besame Mucho music festival featuring a star-studded lineup of dead musicians like Ritchie Valens, Celia Cruz and Chalino Sánchez.
We’re closer to that reality than we think.
Of course, I say all this knowing fully well that my morbid curiosity will get the better of me and I’ll end up listening to the album. And if I’m being fully real with y’all, I would also spend money to attend the hypothetical festival.
I suppose this makes me complicit, and it also forces me to rethink the movie line “anything for Selenas” as a question instead of an exclamation.
When it comes to our fandom, where do we draw the line?"

Column: Villanueva’s beef with firefighters, the L.A. Times, Gascón, ‘Latinx’ and more
BY GUSTAVO ARELLANO

The ostensible purpose of my sit-down with Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva was to talk about his department’s Latino makeup and outlook. It took a bizarre detour when he began to offer random, tone-deaf pronouncements about the Black community for reasons known only to him.
But throughout our one-hour chat, for which he arrived late but nevertheless gave me a tad more than his promised 60 minutes, el sheriff offered all sorts of insights, each more out there — and telling of his Nixonian nature — than the other.
Here’s a grab bag of them:
He thinks the Los Angeles Fire Department has it easy. “They work out, they cook, they go grocery shopping,” Villanueva said, while he claimed his deputies are out on duty “24-7” but get little respect from the public for their hard work. Firefighters? “They host a parade for them when they take a cat out of a tree.”
He accuses The Times of taking unflattering photos of him while portraying other politicians like gods. “When there’s a picture of [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom or [former Los Angeles Unified School District Supervisor Austin] Beutner there’s always this upward thing,” Villanueva said. “There’s this majestic look. And I’m looking down and looking sideways.”
When I pointed out that we have many “nice pictures” of him smiling or looking like, well, a sheriff, he said I didn’t make him look bad; my colleague Alene Tchekmedyian made “a specialty of that,” along with our former colleague Maya Lau: “It says a thousand words. If you want to try to make the person look sinister, in some way or untrustworthy, you guys find a way to take a photo to do that. But you’ll never do that of Newsom.”
Villanueva described himself as “the first person in the nation” at his level of law enforcement prominence to push back “against that Black Lives Matter narrative,” which he didn’t really explain what that was. And “that whole [antifa] crowd didn’t bother going into sheriff’s territory” during the Black Lives Matter rallies held in the summer of 2020 “because they knew what was waiting for them.”
Villanueva said he was never invited to join the Cavemen deputy gang when he was stationed in East Los Angeles because he was “kind of like the nerd” of his group. His nickname back then: “Fletcha” — “arrow” in Spanish. “So when you say ‘Mexican nerd’ thing,” he said, referring to my public description of myself, “I can relate to you.”
OK, I laughed at that.
The June 2020 killing of 18-year-old Andres Guardado by sheriff’s deputies in Gardena has brought continued scrutiny on Villanueva and his department. He labeled a coroner’s inquest into Guardado’s death a “circus stunt” when it happened. But to me, he described what happened to Guardado as a “tragedy” and disclosed that the federal government is “doing their own investigation.”
In explaining how different Latino groups vary in their politics, he mentioned the conservatism of Cuban Americans.
“Except [George] Gascón,” I blurted, referring to L.A. County’s progressive, embattled district attorney, who was born in Cuba and whose recall Villanueva publicly supports.
Upon hearing Gascón’s name, Villanueva got a bemused look on his face. “Yeah, he’s just an oddball from that [Cuban] crowd,” the sheriff said.
He criticized the Los Angeles Police Department for allowing thousands of employees to use religious exemptions to get around the county’s vaccine mandate for all public employees. “Really? They just created a workaround of the mandate,” he said, emphasizing that his department doesn’t allow that because “we’re not going to play games.”
Well, he played a game, I’d say.
Villanueva waged a public battle against the Board of Supervisors and Department of Public Health to defy the mandate. In the past, he reasoned it was a government “intrusion” that infringed on the personal choice of his deputies, and the push was causing a “mass exodus” that endangered the public.
In our interview, he clarified his stance.
“When you want to impose a mandate on your workforce, you better damn well know who your workforce is,” Villanueva said.
And who is his workforce?
He said that his deputies as a department were so anti-vaccine that he placed an “extremely good” 2021 L.A. Times guest op-ed that detailed the seven stages of severe COVID-19 on the internal web page that all L.A. County sheriff’s employees must log on to, to access their work. Villanueva also publicly urged them to get vaccinated, and even offered internal Zoom sessions alongside his command staff with the same message.
But Villanueva never forced his pandejo deputies to get the vaccine, he says, or tried to shame them into getting a jab. “Because as soon as you mandate something, especially people that are suspicious of government,” he explained, “they believe in all these conspiracy theories. You know they’re out there, especially on the right — the conservative crowd in the far right.
“And what is 80% of my workforce?” Villanueva continued. “Conservative and far right.”
Random quote: “The media pays attention to the people screaming the loudest at the street corner. And those are convicted criminals, their families, the people in and out of prison, on parole, on probation, all the advocacy groups that focus on them. And [the media] somehow think that they represent the Latino community.”
Despite his recent overtures to conservatives, Villanueva still calls himself a Democrat. “I’m a Democrat of the party of JFK and FDR,” he said. “I believe the Democratic Party tent should be very big.” But he maintains that his party now practices “intolerance” of divergent views and that the L.A. County Democratic Party is “married” to former L.A. Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and current Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, a fierce Villanueva critic.
Villanueva wants to get reelected, but…
“If I don’t get elected, no hard feelings,” he said. “This job is almost like being president. You get more gray hairs than when you started.”
Breaking News!: Villanueva doesn’t like the term “Latinx” to refer to Latinos.
Shocking, isn’t it?
“No, no, no, no, no,” he said when I threw out the term to see how he’d react. “The Spanish language does not accept ‘Latinx.’” He went on to ridicule people who use it and “their preferred pronouns and all that s—” in an attempt at inclusivity.
“Latinx” to Villanueva is “kind of a modern creation ... where the average Latino says, ‘Screw you.’ The entire language is based on gender. Everything has a gender. Inanimate objects have a gender. El árbol — it’s not la árbol, it’s el árbol.”
If Villanueva doesn’t get reelected, maybe there’s a career in etymology for him?"

Greetings from Russellville, Alabama!
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Earlier this month, I put out a call for readers who live in places that aren’t traditionally known for their Latinx populations. I was inspired by a recent Pew Research Center report that examined where Latinxs are living in the United States, which gave me a great excuse to bring the “Meet our readers” segment back to the newsletter.
Among those to reply was Salvador Blanco, a 24-year-old Guatemalan American from Russellville, Ala.
Alabama isn’t exactly the first place that comes to mind when we think of Latinxs, but its Latinx population increased by more than 42% between 2010 and 2020. Russellville, a city tucked in the northwest corner of the Yellowhammer State, has a population of over 10,000 people. Of those, more than 40% are Latinx.
Perhaps not coincidentally, a poultry plant opened in the city in 1989.
Though both of his parents work at the plant, it was religion that brought Blanco to Alabama. His father served at a Pentecostal church in Los Angeles (Blanco was born in Compton), and briefly relocated to Utah in 2005 before settling in Russellville two years later, where he would start his own church.
Blanco was raised in Pentecostalism but converted to Southern Baptist while living in Alabama. His faith plays a major role in his life; Blanco is involved in his church and plans to attend divinity school.
I asked him what it was like being a person of color involved in a church whose politics have been historically conservative and at odds with social justice.
It’s all about interpretation, he says.
“The God of the Bible is one who cares about justice. That’s not a ‘woke ideology,’” he said. “I’m getting this straight from the same Bible they read.”
As our conversation progressed, Blanco acknowledged that growing up in predominantly white spaces led him to internalize feelings of shame of being Latinx, though that changed in college, where he learned more about his Guatemalan heritage and the history of his birthplace, Los Angeles.
“It’s just a product of living in the Deep South, where you’re a minority and this town is feeling the tension of morphing into this melting pot.”
The longer we spoke, the more it hit me that Blanco’s internal struggle to reconcile these different parts of his identity was nearly identical to that of his hometown.
“Russellville has like nine tiendas Latinas, three of which are Guatemalan. There’s a carniceria and everything,” he said. “But it’s also the same town that’s 30 minutes south of Florence, which is where I live and you can’t get a Jim Crow statue in front of the courthouse taken down.”
Despite this, Blanco feels a sense of hope.
“There’s a restaurant called Buen Sabor that seats like 40 people. Every time I go there, there’s at least 12 to 15 white people thoroughly enjoying the food,” he said. “Stuff like that is beautiful to me. It makes me feel like we’re moving forward.”
As we wrapped up our conversation, Blanco shared an anecdote that he says reflects the optimism he feels about where he lives. He was recently preaching to a group of middle school students. As an icebreaker, Blanco asked the group in English and Spanish about their favorite music before he began his sermon.
“This little Guatemalan girl just looks at me and says, ‘Marimba!’ No one in that group knew what that was, but I did because I’ve been able to stay attached to my culture. I was able to look that little girl in the eye and say, ‘Yes, my parents are also from Guatemala!’ Had a white person been there and asked the same question, who knows if she would have said anything.”"

This one’s for the Latina gay icons
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Quiubo gente!
Every once in a while, we like to turn the main story of the newsletter over to a guest writer or illustrator. The idea is to include as many voices in the Latinx Files as possible. This week, we have a guest writer and illustrator.
Julio Salgado is a visual artist based in Long Beach. His work has been displayed at the Oakland Museum, SFMOMA, and Smithsonian American Art Museum. He also illustrated the newsletter we did celebrating Juan Gabriel’s legacy. To see more of his work, go to juliosalgadoart.com. Take it away, Julio!
A few years ago, my best male friend Jesús — a heterosexual man — asked me why gay men love to listen to female singers. I rolled my eyes because his inquiry was based on a generalization.
One that happens to be true.
The closest answer I could offer was that a lot of gay men feel seen in songs about falling for a guy that you know isn’t good for you, or in songs about female empowerment in a straight white male-dominated world.
I can’t speak for the other gays of the world, but me and my close group of gay friends just prefer female singers. The music from the following Latinas has been in constant rotation in my CD players, iPod nanos, and now on Spotify Music playlists. These singers have given me music that has gotten me through some emotional times.
Jenni Rivera
I’ll start with my personal favorite gay icon, Jenni Rivera.
In the early 2000s, Latinx audiences outside of her native (and mine) Long Beach got to know her because of her national Spanish-language TV performances and interviews.
Fans were in awe of her backstory. She was a struggling single mother trying to make it in the mostly male-dominated banda and Norteña music scene, belting out songs like “La Chacalosa” all over Southern California nightclubs. Since then, songs like “Querida Socia” and “Ya Lo Sé” have become classics.
Funny enough, the only time I actually got to see her perform live was during the Irvine stop of the 2010 Lilith Fair revival. I remember the Mexican gays and señoras in the audience went out of their way to show their love by screaming back every single word that Jenni belted out from the stage.
I never got to see her perform again. She died in a plane crash in 2012. But every time I see a drag queen perform a Jenni Rivera number at the New Jalisco bar or Tempo, I am taken right back to that 2010 concert.
Marisela
In August 2018, me and a group of my closest gays and homegirls rolled up to the Microsoft Theater to see one of our favorite heartbreak singers: Marisela.
Nobody sings songs about secret love affairs and men that leave better than her.
“Marisela has been a gay icon because of the emotional rawness in her art,” said Jorge Gutierrez. An undocumented and queer activist, Gutierrez was among the friends who went with me to see “La Dama De Hierro.”
Perpetually clad in tight miniskirts and messy blonde hair, Marisela was a staple on “Siempre En Domingo,” the Televisa variety show that made or broke the careers of Latin American pop stars throughout the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s.
It wasn’t until I had my first real heartbreak in college that I truly understood what she meant when she sang “Sin él / Se ha acabado el camino / Y ahora no se a donde ir.”
Jenni Rivera was actually a huge Marisela fan. In 2009, she surprised Rivera on stage while la diva de la banda performed a cover of “A Escondidas.” Back at the Microsoft Theater and after way too many Patron shots, I drunkenly sang along to that same song with my gays and my homegirls, cursing every man that broke our hearts.
Gloria Trevi
One of my all-time favorite Gloria Trevi performances is her infamous 1989 debut in “Siempre En Domingo.” I’m serious when I say that show made and broke careers because she actually got banned from Televisa after her so-called raunchy performance got her in trouble with the powers that be. I don’t remember seeing this specific performance when I was a little kid, but I’ve seen it a million times on YouTube.
In the early ’90s, little girls and gay boys all over Latin America lip-synced into hairbrushes to Gloria Trevi classics like “Pelo Suelto” and “Zapatos Viejos.” She was a star.
That all changed in 2000 after she and her manager were arrested for allegedly kidnapping and abusing underage girls. Trevi spent four years in jail before she was acquitted of all the charges.
At the 2018 Latin AMAs, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Trevi opened up about the incident and shared her own story of being physically and emotionally abused by the same manager starting when she was only 15 years old. When she tried to reignite her career, it was Gloria Trevi’s gay fans who were quick to embrace the fallen star. When it came time to put out a video for her 2006 hit “Todos Me Miran,” she acknowledged the continuous support from the LGBTQ+ community by centering the story of a trans woman facing Mexican society.
Pilar Diaz from Los Abandoned
During my community college years, I balanced pop hits being played all over WeHo nightclubs with some of the best alternative Latinx music coming out of places like La Cita and the Echo.
One of my favorite bands from that mid-2000s scene was Los Abandoned, led by the amazing Pilar Diaz. It made me happy to see that “Van Nuys (Es Very Nice)” was rightfully included in the Times’ “50 Songs for A New L.A.”
I was such a fan that for a while, I was part of their street team. At every single show, there was always a group of us queers jumping up and down to songs like “Me Quieren En Chile” and “Stalk U.”
“My goal is that I want people to feel free to be themselves,” said Diaz of her band’s LGBTQ+ fans. “People felt that they could be themselves through our music. Back then we weren’t necessarily thinking of ‘safe space,’ but it was naturally like that.”
La Marisoul from La Santa Cecilia
When I was about to drop out of college just a couple of semesters short of graduating due to lack of funds because of my undocumented status, my friends put together a fundraiser show. They hired a then-little-known band called La Santa Cecilia.
That’s right! Before they were Grammy-award winners and becoming an international sensation, my friends and I got to see La Santa Cecilia perform in my parent’s small living room in Long Beach!
I became an instant fan, and helped pack the dance floor at La Cita with other fans whenever I could.
“I feel super grateful for the love of the queer community because this is the people I grew up with,” said La Marisoul.
“I’m bisexual and I’ve been in love with women, and I’ve come out to my parents. The spaces that we play is for all of us weirdos and queer kids that love all kinds of music. Music is my superpower!”
La Marisoul and La Santa Cecilia have also used their popularity to speak up in support of undocumented community. Their song “ICE El Hielo” is arguably one of the best songs about the plights that we face as undocumented immigrants in the U.S."

J.D. Vance asks if you ‘hate Mexicans’
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

J.D. Vance is a joke.
For those of you who are unfamiliar, Vance became a literary darling in 2016 after the publication of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a veritable triumph of the will memoir that chronicles his journey from a Rust Belt Ohio town to Yale Law School.
The book doubles as a libertarian social critique of a “hillbilly” culture that blames everyone but itself for its woes. Despite growing up poor with a drug-addicted abusive mother, Vance was able to lift himself by the bootstraps and make it inside the hallowed halls of the Ivy League.
“Hillbilly Elegy” became a New York Times bestseller and was even adapted into a critically panned Netflix movie directed by Ron Howard.
It wasn’t just conservatives buying into Vance either.
“Five years ago, Vance was eloquently decoding Donald Trump supporters for liberal elites, while lamenting the rise of Trump himself,” wrote Simon van Zuylen-Wood in a January profile published in the Washington Post Magazine.
Now Vance is running for Senate in Ohio, a state the former president comfortably won in 2016 and 2020, and has desperately tried to walk back his past criticism of Trump.
“Look, I mean, all of us say stupid things and I happened to say stupid things very publicly,” he said at a debate in March.
Vance hasn’t just apologized. He has gone full Trump.
On Tuesday his campaign unveiled an ad that doesn’t bother with subtlety.
“Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?” he asks would-be voters with the same energy of a late-night infomercial trying to sell you a shoddily made product you certainly don’t need or even want.
Vance then goes on to blame immigrants for all of Ohio’s ills. Never mind that the southern border is more than 1,400 miles away or that the Buckeye State’s Latinx population is less than 5%.
“This issue is personal,” Vance says. “I nearly lost my mother to the poison coming across our border.”
It’s worth pointing out that Vance famously recounts in his memoir that his mom would steal her patients’ painkillers while working as a nurse. But sure, let’s blame it on the Mexicans.
So much for the GOP being the party of personal responsibility.
The campaign ad was predictably lambasted on social media. What I didn’t expect, however, was for it to become a meme. I was pleasantly surprised to see J.D. Vance be made into a joke.
Within hours, the racist video’s opening lines of “Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?” had been clipped by user @lib_crusher. It was only a matter of time before paisa Twitter got ahold of it.
“Me to the universe when experiencing even the most minor of inconveniences,” quipped one user.
“When U.S. Soccer schedules a World Cup qualifier in Ohio,” cracked a friend of mine, a nod to the fact that Ohio has long been hostile to Mexicans, at least when it comes to soccer.
“Me at my husband because he doesn’t speak Spanish,” joked another.
It was a beautiful thing to see a group of people — my people — that have been historically maligned taking something so vitriolic and turning it around.
The jokes were made even funnier when you consider that Vance currently finds himself in third in the GOP Senate primary race, behind two candidates who got into a shouting match trying to out-MAGA each other.
That could very well change. Vance has publicly debased himself time and time again in hopes that Trump will give him an endorsement that might not come. You never know, he may actually get it.
Then again, Ted Cruz has been trying that strategy for years to no avail."

How shuttering schools can speed up gentrification
BY LAURA NEWBERRY

Public school districts across California have been facing plummeting enrollment for five years, a trend spurred by pandemic struggles, falling birth rates, out-of-state migration, among other factors.
Because funding for California public schools is based on student attendance, districts may soon be facing big budget shortfalls, if they aren’t already — although legislative discussions are underway to possibly ease the hit. One way districts are addressing this problem, however, is by shuttering schools with dwindling student enrollment. In February, Oakland school board members voted to close seven of the city’s public schools by 2024. Some L.A. Unified schools also face uncertain futures.
There’s been intense pushback from parents, students and teachers in Oakland, who argue that closures will harm communities that have already faced decades of disinvestment. “You’re pushing out Black and brown students that deserve to be in their schools,” an Oakland Unified student testified at a school board meeting in February. “We’re still in a pandemic, which is hard enough to navigate. But pushing these kids and families into positions that not many can adjust to is not OK. Students’ mental health matters. It matters more than money. Prioritize these relationships and connections that make them feel safe, that make them feel like they belong.”
I was surprised to learn that even though closing schools is a common response to under-enrollment, very little is known about the effects of school closures on nearby neighborhoods, which according to scholars are disproportionately low-income and Black.
Researchers at Stanford set out to fill that gap. They found that school closures increased gentrification, but only in Black neighborhoods.
The study, set to publish this spring, examined every urban school closure nationwide between 2000 and 2012. It revealed that closures increased the likelihood of property values rising and more affluent households moving into Black communities, from 19 to 27%. When school closures happened in white and Latinx communities, however, researchers found no evidence of the same pattern.
I spoke with the study’s co-authors, Francis Pearman and Danielle Marie Greene, about possible explanations for these findings.
Affluent people moving into a previously disinvested neighborhood generally consider public schools with mostly white or Latinx students an asset, Pearman told me. Yet they’re more likely to have negative associations with schools that serve large numbers of Black students. “When it comes to Black neighborhoods, affluent people do mind the neighborhood school,” Pearman said of the study findings. “If you close it, it increases the likelihood that the neighborhood will be seen as a potential destination.”
On the other hand, when Black schools in these neighborhoods stay open, they may act as a safeguard against gentrification. “This is partly due to the fact that white, affluent households are unlikely to enroll their children at majority Black schools, regardless of their quality,” Pearman said.
Oakland school board member Mike Hutchinson, whose 2020 election campaign revolved around ending school closures and financial mismanagement, had a blunt reaction to these findings. ""[The researchers] might not use the words racism or white supremacy,” he said, “but what they describe is the definition of white supremacy ideology and anti-Black racism.”
Gentrification can also contribute to declining school enrollment, according to a 2019 study by Pearman. That’s because when affluent people move into gentrifying neighborhoods, they often opt to send their kids to private or charter schools. And if the local school then closes due to under-enrollment, gentrification may intensify. It’s a cyclical process, Pearman explained.
The number of school closures in cities across the U.S. has steadily grown since the early 2000s, when No Child Left Behind legislation enabled districts to shut down or merge schools if they weren’t meeting certain standards, including enrollment, standardized test score performance and building conditions. In 2013 alone, Chicago shuttered 47 elementary schools. Other cities, like Detroit and Philadelphia, followed suit, closing over 50 schools in the following years. Low-income and Black students were the most likely to have their schools closed, research shows.
“In a lot of these neighborhoods, schools are the last institutions standing. Grocery stores, parks, churches may be gone, and schools become the community’s backbone,” said Noli Brazil, a community and regional development professor at UC Davis. “Closing schools takes away their last thread of dignity.”
When community organizers speak out against school closures, gentrification is not often named explicitly. Opponents typically point out the impact on students’ education, like longer travel times to and from school and larger class sizes. But it’s all related, Hutchinson said.
“Closures are only faced by certain communities, and these are the same communities where people are seeing their rent prices explode, where landlords are no longer taking Section 8,” he told me, referring to the federal housing voucher program. “All of these things are in interplay with each other.” This is especially true in Oakland, which was 47% Black in 1980. Now it’s around 23% Black, according to the U.S. Census, a demographic shift fueled by the housing affordability crisis and the displacement of longtime residents.
“Housing inequity is connected to racial inequity, which is connected to schooling inequity,” Greene said. “These are not things we can easily pull apart like a Twizzler.”
Jazmin Garcia, an organizer for the member-led, statewide community organization ACCE Institute, has made the same connections between the changing landscape of communities and the threat of school closures in L.A. Unified, which since 2000 has seen a 40% drop in student enrollment.
Garcia helped organize parents and teachers against the potential closure of Trinity Street Elementary School in South L.A., a majority-Latinx school. “We’re seeing developers come in and pushing Black and brown families out. Many of our members with kids at Trinity are also applying for rent relief,” she said. “Whether or not working-class folks of color know that closures are tied to their displacement, they feel it. They’re living it.”
Brazil noted that school closures could hypothetically lead to positive outcomes for students if districts established an organized, transparent process that ensures students will be enrolled in a better-performing school, and engaged with the communities well in advance of the closures. But that is not often the case. In fact, students are more likely to be moved to another under-resourced school after a closure, Pearman said.
Pearman noted that school-closure decisions tend to be made through a “race-neutral lens.” The potential impact on the fabric of communities is rarely discussed. And even though these plans are approved with the expressed intention of improving opportunities for disadvantaged children, closures may actually contribute to the disintegration of their neighborhoods.
“Everyone wants to be doing something on behalf of Black and brown students,” Greene said. “But so far, it feels like we’ve been making those decisions on their behalf without fully understanding the actual consequences.”"

Place History: Avenue 50 and other Eastside havens from gentrification
BY VICKIE VÉRTIZ

The doors built into the cobalt blue facade of Avenue 50 Studio, adorned with a vibrant Sagrado Corazón, seem always to be open. Kathy Gallegos, director and visual artist, developed this space into a Latinx community arts nonprofit in the heart of Highland Park, launching and promoting the careers of writers and visual artists alike. Since she first opened those doors in 2000, Gallegos has grown a small live/work space into galleries, artist studios and headquarters for the multilingual poetry press and library Alternative Field. Though COVID-19 put a long pause on events, Avenue 50 is back with exhibits, tenants’ union meetings, workshops and La Palabra, a monthly poetry reading series.
Combining visual and literary arts made sense to Gallegos. When poet Rafael Alvarado approached her with La Palabra 20 years ago, “It was perfect,” she said. “Poetry inspires us to make visual art and vice versa.” Gallegos created the space to help Chicanx and Latinx visual artists who were being rejected by local museums. Gallegos knows writers face similar obstacles. Avenue 50 centers on Latinx work but has grown to celebrate other diverse artists.
On a recent Sunday, the main gallery was filled to capacity for the launch of Angelina Sáenz’s poetry collection “Edgecliff.” The high windows let in afternoon light, illuminating Roberto Gutierrez’s sumi ink abstracts and everyone in attendance. The week before, Ashley Garcia of @brown.girl.travels organized a free book fair that included mariachis and clothes from the @radicalclothesswap project; more than 400 people had participated.
Avenue 50 is just one of many spaces east of downtown that host literary events, at times mixed with art and performance, including Little Tokyo’s long-running Tuesday Night Project, bookstore Other Books/Otros Libros, Lincoln Heights’ Plaza de la Raza, Cal State Los Angeles’ Center for Contemporary Poetry and Poetics and Ofelia Esparza y familia’s Tonalli Studio.
These gathering places are just one part of a resilient Eastside scene that cultivates working-class, queer and POC voices in a city whose cultural establishments do not often represent them. In recent years, they have fought hard against the rising costs and displacement that come with gentrification, especially in Highland Park. Avenue 50 has seen its rent double since the last time it was sold; Gallegos had tried to buy the space then, but the Anglo owner had told her it “wasn’t for her.” In persevering, her gallery and others serve as a vital reminder of the communities, movements and creative forces that were here first, no matter what the landlords say.
La Palabra has played a big role in that vitality. The series has featured established writers like Peter J. Harris and Gloria E. Alvarez, but hundreds of emerging writers have also performed. Current curator Sáenz said the series “bring[s] diverse authors to a diverse audience and make[s] it accessible to all.” The venue has also sponsored readings in laundromats and the Metro.
Avenue 50’s mission is even broader than that. Housing a community pantry and, for a time, a vaccination site, it embodies how writers and visual artists can creatively address socioeconomic needs. The gallery bridges creative gaps through Alternative Field, a press that doubles as a multilingual lending library.
“Poets think differently about problems,” said Alternative Field founder Jessica Ceballos y Campbell, a writer, designer and housing rights activist. The library is a space where people can make zines, learn how to publish their work and brainstorm larger creative projects. Alternative Field has published 20 books since 2018, partnering with groups like Glendale Community College and mental health organizations to showcase the work of an entire city, not just those who identify as writers.
What will really help Avenue 50 achieve its goals, Gallegos said, is for readers and collectors to spread the word and buy the work. “We’re [making] the work of Chicano and Latino artists visible. And it’s hard,” she said.
Ceballos described the value of Avenue 50 like this: “This is literature as it is supposed to be: by and for everyone. It’s all of us or none, right?”"

The troubling case of Lizelle Herrera
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

Lizelle Herrera should have never been arrested.
The 26-year-old Rio Grande Valley woman was taken into custody last Thursday and charged with murder, accused of causing “the death of an individual by self induced abortion.”
By Sunday, days after Herrera’s arrest had become a national story, the murder charge was dropped. In a public statement, Starr County Dist. Atty. Gocha Allen Ramirez acknowledged she had committed no crime.
Privately, Ramirez texted Herrera’s attorney to apologize.
“I’m so sorry,” he wrote, according to the Washington Post. “I assure you I never meant to hurt this young lady.”
Herrera is now free, but a lot of questions and concerns still remain.
For starters, it’s still unclear what law Herrera was accused of breaking in the first place. Though Texas recently passed one of the most restrictive antiabortion laws in the country, the Texas Heartbeat Act doesn’t criminalize abortions.
And it’s worrisome that it was hospital staff that allegedly reported Herrera to the authorities. It’s a massive breach of trust.
“Low income people of color cannot walk into a hospital safely and know that they will be able to be honest with their medical providers and give them information that might save their life because they might go to jail,” Rockie Gonzalez, founder and board chair of the Frontera Fund, said to MSNBC.
That this happened in the RGV doesn’t shock me. The border region has long been a canary in the reproductive rights coal mine.
It was there that Rosie Jimenez died after having an unsafe abortion in 1977. She became the first documented victim of the Hyde Amendment, which made it illegal to use federal funds to pay for an abortion.
And it was local activists who were most responsible for freeing Herrera. As the Texas Tribune reports, a coalition of reproductive rights grass-roots organizations quickly mobilized to raise money to post her bail and set up a legal defense fund. They also orchestrated a phone campaign to bombard the district attorney and sheriff with calls demanding Herrera’s release.
“I think the resounding message is that there’s a whole community of people out there that are going to stand up and show up for abortion access,” said Nancy Cárdenas Peña, Texas director of policy and advocacy for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. “We just give them hell, and we’re not going to stop.”"

Coronavirus Today: A COVID milestone for Latinx people
BY KAREN KAPLAN

Good evening. I’m Karen Kaplan, and it’s Tuesday, April 19. Here’s the latest on what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.
Back in 1986, researchers noticed something surprising about Latinx people living in the southwestern United States: Their “health status” was remarkably similar to that of their white neighbors even though their socioeconomic status was significantly lower. The similarities were evident whether you looked at infant mortality, measures of functional health, or the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease or cancer.
Most notably, they reported, life expectancies were slightly higher for Latinx men and women than they were for white residents — in California and Texas, at least.
The findings were so confounding that the researchers dubbed it “an epidemiologic paradox.”
But it wasn’t a fluke. A 2015 Vital Signs report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that although Latinx residents were nearly three times more likely than white residents to lack health insurance and had significantly higher rates of obesity (among other apparent disadvantages), their death rate at that time was 24% lower than it was for whites.
Medical experts aren’t entirely sure how to explain this. Usually, having chronic health problems isn’t conducive to a longer lifespan. Nor is it helpful to have less access to healthcare and less money to spend on things to keep your body in good shape, like fresh produce and gym memberships.
Fortunately, Latinx Americans have other things going for them. They’re younger than white residents, on average. They’re much less likely to smoke. The authors of the CDC report also speculated that self-selection works in their favor, since the people who immigrated to the U.S. were probably healthy, and those who were elderly or ill likely returned to their home countries.
Other research suggests a biological edge. As we age, our genes change the way they function. The speed with which those changes occur can be measured with a so-called epigenetic clock, and scientists have found that the clock advances more slowly for Latinx Americans than it does for white Americans.
Whatever the reason for this mortality advantage, it would take a lot to undo it. But the coronavirus may have pulled this off.
A study published last year in the medical journal Lancet found that COVID-19 reduced the average life expectancy of Latinx people in the U.S. from 81.8 years in 2018 to 78 years in 2020. A Latinx baby born in 2020 would still outlive a white baby by about eight months, on average, but that’s far less than the 3.2-year advantage he or she would have had in 2018.
The huge drop reflects the outsize toll COVID-19 has taken on Latinx communities, and especially on working-age adults. The younger the victims, the more years of life that were taken from them — and that means a bigger hit to average life expectancy.
New data from Los Angeles County suggest that by Year 2 of the pandemic, the longevity advantage for Latinx residents had been wiped out.
As my colleagues Andrew J. Campa, Rong-Gong Lin II and Emily Alpert Reyes report, the county’s Latinx residents suffered 756 deaths per 100,000 people last year. That’s up 48% from 2019, when the mortality rate was 511 deaths per 100,000 Latinx residents.
Meanwhile, the mortality rate for white residents increased from 630 to 678 deaths per 100,000 during the same time period. That means Latinx residents absorbed 78 more deaths per 100,000 people than did white residents.
Although Latinx people experienced the largest increase in mortality rate, Black residents had the highest mortality rate both before and after the onset of the pandemic. In 2019, they experienced 835 deaths per 100,000; in 2021, that number rose to 1,027 deaths per 100,000.
Not all of the county’s deaths in 2021 were caused by COVID-19, of course, but the new disease accounts for most of the increase seen since 2019. (A caveat: These mortality rates are based on provisional data and don’t include L.A. County residents who died outside of California. But the figures have been adjusted to account for the age differences among racial and ethnic groups.)
Ironically, some of the factors that allowed the paradox to exist in the first place surely helped erase it once a highly infectious disease was added to the mix. These include the prevalence of tight-knit, multi-generational families who often work together and live under the same roof.
If just one member of the family became infected with the coronavirus, he or she would be primed to spread it to many others — including elderly relatives, who are particularly vulnerable due to their age. And that risk was higher to start with, since Latinx adults were more likely to have jobs that required them to be out in the world instead of holed up at home.
“We work in stores and factories, sell food and clean, and we’re going to run into people,” Carlos Montes, a Chicano activist living in Boyle Heights, told my colleagues. “Being essential [workers] really hurt us because we got sick and then spread it our families.”
Raul Claros, a community organizer who lives in Chinatown, lost his father to a combination of COVID-19 and cancer. Staying a safe distance from his dad was a real emotional challenge for him and other family members.
“We take care of each other’s families because we migrated here together and brought our families here to live,” he said. “It’s the whole village approach.”
It sustained the community for years — until it didn’t, he said: The “village got blown up in 2020.”"

The other Coachella
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

When I think of Coachella, the first thing that comes to mind is an influencer wearing a flower crown trying to take the perfect Instagram photo.
This weekend, however, I came across two tweets that made me reevaluate that admittedly unfair characterization.
The first was an image posted to Twitter on Friday evening right around the time that Grupo Firme was set to perform for the first time at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. As my colleague Suzy Exposito reported, Mexican regional music is prominently represented in this year’s lineup.
It was a fact not lost on Paisa Twitter.
Within moments of the lineup reveal back in January, photoshopped images of headliner Harry Styles dressed as a takuache popped up in my little corner of the internet. The running joke was that it wasn’t just going to be hipsters at Coachella, but toxicas and tíos too.
And then it actually happened.
“Grupo Firme at Coachella is a vibe,” Angel Chavez tweeted, attaching a photo of an older Latinx couple waiting in the crowd to watch the Tijuana band’s historic performance.
“I knew it was going to go viral,” the 29-year-old budding YouTube content creator and Coachella resident told me. His post currently has more than 2,500 retweets.
In the quote tweets, people commented about how the photo was aspirational and heartening. They saw a future version of themselves or a proxy for their parents having a good time.
“It just felt like it was people from the neighborhood,” Chavez added.
The second tweet in question came from @UFWUpdates, the social media account of the United Farm Workers, the union founded by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.
It was a clever response to a tweet by a popular pro-labor account that rhetorically asked what “a Coachella” was, and it also included a photo. But instead of showing festivalgoers, the image featured farm worker Albam Ochoa holding a crate of dates.
It was a reminder that Coachella isn’t just a place for music festivals. It’s also an agricultural hub that feeds this country.
“I feel like we’re at this point in society where there’s a huge number of people who think they know what fruit is healthiest for them based on their blood type but have no concept of the reality of what it took to get that food to their plate,” said Elizabeth Strater, a UFW organizer who helps run the union’s social media accounts.
Strater says one of the primary goals of @UFWUpdates is to humanize and to give a voice to the farmworkers. Although she replied to the tweet by Jorts the Cat (for more on Jorts, read columnist Anita Chabria’s profile from last month), the photo of Ochoa was taken by his co-worker Fredy Alban. In fact, much of the content published by the account comes from the workers themselves.
“When you look at the account every single day, you’re going to see a farmworker, you’re going to hear their name and you’re going to hear their message.”
Near the end of our conversation, Strater offered to put me in touch with Aguileo Rangel Rojas, a farmworker and resident of the Coachella Valley since 2004, to get the local perspective.
Originally from Guanajuato, the 54-year-old has picked grapes, lettuce and carrots.
In his free time, he likes to pick at his guitar or play the accordion. Music turns him into another person, he said. He interprets other people’s songs, but likes to write his own too. At one point, Rangel mentioned he was working on a corrido in honor of slain journalists in Mexico and abroad, and even sang the first two verses a cappella. His dream is to one day record his music.
Rangel says his experience of the festival doesn’t go beyond driving past it, though he doesn’t completely dispute the common characterization of the region.
“Esa es la realidad, porque aquí se hace la fiesta,” he says. That’s the reality because that’s where the party happens.
“Pero si se refiere a la forma de vida que llevamos muchas personas aquí, pues esa realidad está muy lejos de como vivimos.”
That other Coachella, he says, is another world."

Bad Bunny just made history with Marvel casting, but fans are a little perplexed
BY CHRISTI CARRAS

Sony Pictures has cast Puerto_Rican reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny as El Muerto, the first Latinx superhero to lead a live-action Marvel film. But some Marvel fans are skeptical of the studio giant’s approach to the project.
The Los Angeles Times confirmed Tuesday that the beloved Latin trap artist and wrestling aficionado will play Juan-Carlos Estrada Sanchez, a.k.a. El Muerto, a masked Mexican wrestler who inherits superhuman strength from his powerful ancestors. His casting was announced Monday at CinemaCon in Las Vegas.
“It’s amazing. It’s incredible. I love wrestling. I grew up watching it, and now I’m a wrestler,” Bad Bunny told the CinemaCon crowd, according to Entertainment Weekly.
“This is why I love this character. ... It’s the perfect role to me. It will be epic.”
In the comic books, El Muerto is associated with Spider-Man, Sony’s most bankable Marvel character. However, he shows up only in two volumes of the “Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man” saga, leading many to wonder why Sony would give him the live-action treatment over more popular Latinx characters — such as Spider-Man 2099 or Miles Morales, the young web slinger at the heart of the animated “Spider-Verse” movies.
“This character has appeared in two issues, sixteen years ago,” one person tweeted. “Sony, be honest, you’re messing with us on purpose right?”
“This is hilarious on like subatomic levels,” wrote Eric Francisco, senior entertainment reporter at Inverse. “The character doesn’t even have a proper Wikipedia page.”
Others rejoiced at the idea of Bad Bunny entering the Marvel universe.
“Say what?!?! Omg so here for Bad Bunny joining the Spiderverse,” one person tweeted.
“Ok with this and Bullet Train, Bad Bunny is really having a moment and I’m into it,” wrote another.
Bad Bunny is the latest Latinx performer to be cast as a Marvel hero, following the recent Marvel debuts of Salma Hayek as Ajak and Lauren Ridloff as Makkari in “Eternals,” as well as Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight in the Disney+ series of the same name. Next month, Xochitl Gomez will make her first appearance as America Chavez in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”
Previously, Bad Bunny guest-starred in the third season of “Narcos: Mexico” as Arturo “Kitty” Paez, a member of Ramón Arellano Félix’s gang. And in July, the Grammy winner will grace the big screen in the action thriller “Bullet Train,” also starring Brad Pitt, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Joey King.
According to Deadline, the “A Tu Merced” hitmaker is additionally set to appear in the forthcoming film “American Sole” opposite Pete Davidson, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Camila Mendes and Offset.
Prior to landing the role of El Muerto, Bad Bunny already began chasing his wrestling dreams by rumbling with the pros at last year’s WWE Royal Rumble and WrestleMania.
“El Muerto” is slated to hit theaters Jan. 12, 2024."

How diverse are Hollywood talent agencies? One leading player shares its numbers
BY WENDY LEE

Following the protests over the murder of George Floyd, talent agencies and other Hollywood institutions faced their own reckoning over systemic racism and vowed to diversify their employee ranks.
So how are they doing two years later? That’s hard to say because most of the major agencies have yet to publicly disclose the racial and gender breakdowns of their staffs.
One exception is Beverly Hills-based entertainment and media business Endeavor. The owner of talent agency WME this week disclosed a detailed breakdown of its 7,000-person staff by gender and race for a second consecutive year.
The results, shared with The Times, show that the company has made some strides compared to a year ago but, like other media and entertainment businesses, has a ways to go.
Of the employees surveyed, 56.9% identified as male in 2021, with men comprising an even larger majority of leadership roles (65.4%), though down slightly from 2020.
The percentage of female employees was about flat last year (42.6%) compared with 2020. Women in leadership roles improved 3% from 2020, as more than half of the company’s 2,013 new hires last year identified as women, the company said.
In the U.S., 64.8% of its roughly 4,500-person staff was white and so was 75.4% of its leadership, Endeavor said.
But the company experienced modest gains in representation by people of color on its U.S. staff, with Hispanic and Latinx staffers increasing 1.1 percentage points to 10.9%; Black employees increasing 1.6 percentage points to 8.7%; and Asian American staffers up 0.7 percentage points to 7.2% compared to 2020.
Despite the gains, the numbers are mostly well below national population levels. In the U.S., Latinos represent 18.7% of the population, Black residents comprise 12.4% and Asians make up 6%, according to the U.S. Census’ 2020 count.
Endeavor executives concede they have work to do but say that disclosing internal data, which was shared with employees this week, is an important step.
“It was really important for us to start to be just more accountable because everyone can have these big goals and things that they say they’re going to do,” said Romola Ratnam, head of impact and inclusion. “It’s a really useful tool, and if a company is serious about this work, I would recommend them considering it because it’s a really great way to hold yourself accountable and keep moving.”
Endeavor has been working with Color of Change and WME client Michael B. Jordan as part of its #ChangeHollywood initiative to provide solutions to racial justice, support antiracist content and invest in authentic Black stories and talent.
In 2020, Endeavor pledged to release its diversity data, work with colleges to recruit people from underrepresented communities, train its script readers to flag concerning bias and scale up its virtual industry education programs to help people break into the entertainment industry. Endeavor also has implemented an inclusion rider for its fashion productions, including during New York Fashion Week.
The company’s goal is to increase the percentage of employees of color in the U.S. to 35% by 2024, up from the current level of 30%.
Endeavor plans to implement additional efforts to improve diversity and inclusion, including setting up a structure to track its progress; including at least two candidates from underrepresented groups before filling open roles for external job postings; and having dedicated signing targets for underrepresented groups.
“Upending systems and processes takes time, but it’s the surest path to real, sustainable change,” Endeavor President Mark Shapiro said in a statement. “While we still have a lot of work to do, we’re proud of the steps we’ve taken to move closer to representation that better reflects the communities in which we live and work.”
Agents play a vital role in securing coveted jobs for Hollywood talent. But in recent years, representation agencies and management firms have been criticized for not being diverse enough, and some have been called out for how they treat people of color on staff.
Some agents, hoping to speed up solutions to Hollywood’s diversity problems, have gone on to lead newer management firms focused on helping underrepresented communities.
Other major talent agencies have said they are implementing plans to diversify their workforce and the entertainment industry by partnering with different organizations, through donations and by stepping up recruitment efforts.
Beverly Hills-based UTA said in 2021 it promoted more than 50 people across 20 departments, with nearly 60% identifying as women and one-third as people of color. Its other efforts included raising the minimum hourly wage to $22 in 2020, which at the time was the highest of any major agency.
In 2020, CAA established a cultural business strategy group to drive business and creative growth opportunities for its diverse clients. The Century City firm has a female-majority board that oversees day-to-day management and has programs internally to help elevate next-generation agents, executives and interns.
But, so far, none of Endeavor’s rivals have publicly disclosed similar companywide racial and demographic data.
Kelle Rozell, Color of Change’s chief marketing and storytelling officer, said she would like to see that change.
“Making these commitments and laying out roadmaps, I think the key to it is the transparency,” Rozell said. “That’s really where the accountability begins. So without doing that, it kind of is a sign that maybe the intentionality is not really there.”"

How not to mess up Bad Bunny’s ‘El Muerto’
BY FIDEL MARTINEZ

By now you’ve probably read that Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, alias el Bad Bunny, will become the first Latinx superhero to lead a live-action Marvel film in Sony Pictures’ upcoming “El Muerto.”
If you’re unfamiliar with the character, that’s likely because El Muerto is a very obscure figure that has a whoppin’ two total appearances in the comic books (2005’s “Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, issues 6 and 7). The entirety of his narrative arc is that he is a luchador unwillingly following in his father’s footsteps and that he has to wrestle Spider-Man in order not to be killed by a villain named El Dorado. Also, the mask is the source of his superhuman strength.
But while El Muerto is largely unknown, El Conejo Malo is one of the biggest stars in the world. He’s been Spotify’s most streamed artist for two years in a row. He’s bankable. The man convinced people to buy Crocs. Surely San Benito can sell a character with more stereotypes than backstory.
How do I feel about the whole thing?
*In deep The Rock Voice* It doesn’t matter what I think because Hollywood is going to continue to be Hollywood, and if they want to pander to a group of people they’ve long ignored but taken lots of money from, then that’s exactly what Hollywood is going to do!
But if they’re going to pander, then they should at least do it right. With that in mind, here’s a list of suggestions for Sony Pictures to make sure that “El Muerto” doesn’t suck as much as “Morbius” did. I have no idea how far along the studio is in the filmmaking process, but if they can delay the release of the first Sonic movie to make the hedgehog look less creepy, or reshoot a movie with a new actor to avoid the embarrassment of having Kevin Spacey in it, surely they can figure out a way to implement the following recommendations:
1. Make sure Bad Bunny doesn’t take off his mask. I know it sounds counterintuitive to not show the audience the face of the person they paid money to go see, but trust me on this one. Lucha Libre is all about the sacredness of the mask and the identity it protects. Besides, have you seen the levels of drippage displayed by El Santo and Blue Demon whenever they would wear regular clothes?
2. Speaking of El Santo and Blue Demon, have El Muerto fight some aliens or mummies. That’d be cool.
3. For the love of Aluche, do not use sepia filters for scenes set in Mexico. If Steven Soderbergh and Tony Scott (q.e.p.d.) couldn’t pull it off, there’s absolutely no chance whoever you get to direct this thing will. Better yet, don’t set it in Mexico at all. Use the American Southwest instead.
4. Make sure you include a few scenes of El Muerto cutting his teeth (and his body) by doing some backyard wrestling. I want to see a Soderbergh-like, handycam sequence of Bad Bunny being suplexed through a table.
5. El Muerto is originally from Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, which means you have to have some banda and/or narcocorridos in the soundtrack. Perhaps Bad Bunny can do a song featuring El Komander? You at least have to include a Chalino song.
5. Cameos. Lots of them. And I’m not talking about other superheroes, either (though I should note that a plainclothes Wolverine does show up in El Muerto’s first appearance). I want to see Cassandro El Exotico. I want to see Tinieblas, Mascara Sagrada, Thunder Rosa and Rey Mysterio Jr. Heck, if there’s not a scene in which el “Tropi” Casas and Tirantes are referees, then I’m going to consider this movie a dud."
