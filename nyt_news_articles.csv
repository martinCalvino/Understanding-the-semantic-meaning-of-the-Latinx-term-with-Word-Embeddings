In the Art World, ‘Latinx’ Marks a Gender-Free Spot
By Jori Finkel

LOS ANGELES — This week represents the official start of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, some 70 museum exhibitions, from San Diego to Santa Barbara, that explore Latin American and Latino art. With galleries getting into the act, too, visitors to the shows are likely to encounter tons of new work. And two new words: Latinx and Chicanx.
At the very moment that “Latino” and “Chicano” art are poised to make a big splash, some curators are pushing to replace those masculine words with new genderless terms they find more inclusive: “Latinx” for anyone in North America with roots from Latin America — male, female or gender-nonconforming — and “Chicanx” for anyone of Mexican descent.
Never mind that the neologisms have not made it into the Merriam-Webster or Oxford English Dictionary, or that the Getty Foundation, which financed Pacific Standard Time to the tune of about $16 million, is sticking with “Latino.” Several P.S.T. curators are dropping these new terms in panels and papers. Their publicists are using them in email blasts. Art magazines like Artnews, Flash Art and Frieze are following suit, while #latinx is gaining currency on Twitter and Instagram among political activists, student associations and various bloggers. (A recent tweet from the writers’ group Latino Caucus criticized when “a journal touts support for POC” — people of color — “yet no #Latinx people on staff or in their publication.”)
“We’re seeing the terms become a lot more common, especially with young people,” Joan Weinstein, deputy director of the Getty Foundation, acknowledged. “But we really wanted to reach a wide audience with a wide range of ages, so we thought we needed language recognized by everyone.”
Among those adopting the new language is Bill Kelley Jr., the lead curator of a P.S.T. exhibition at the Otis College of Art and Design featuring artist-activists. He said the word Latinx has a “political charge.”
“The word is a proposal to change the machismo in the culture and the language,” he said.
For her part, Macarena Gómez-Barris used Chicanx repeatedly in her catalog essay on the photographer Laura Aguilar, a key artist in a West Hollywood exhibition about the area’s pre-AIDS “queer” art scene. “Her gender does not fall within ‘Chicano’ and the people she studies with her camera are butches and femmes and gender-nonconforming,” said Ms. Gómez-Barris, the head of social sciences and cultural studies at Pratt Institute in New York.
She calls the “x” of Latinx and Chicanx (pronounced Latinex and Chicanex) a “queering” of the gendering of nouns and adjectives natural to the Spanish language, which also turns Latinas into Latinos the moment one man enters the group. “The x marks a kind of political resistance and provocation,” she said.
Ms. Gómez-Barris pressed for using the word Chicanx in the show’s title. But she lost that battle: it is called “Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A.”
C. Ondine Chavoya, a Williams College professor and a curator of “Axis Mundo,” said that for the title “we wanted to go with the more familiar, recognizable term that could help with online searching.”
Scholars say that Latinx, the broader and more popular of the new terms, began to appear as early as 2004 in LGBTQ communities online but did not really take off until two or three years ago. This year Google Scholar shows about a thousand academic articles using the term, twice the number from 2016.
An Ohio State University professor, Frederick Luis Aldama, changed the name of his high school outreach program, LASER, to the Latinx Space for Enrichment and Research (He titled his new book “Latinx Superheroes in Mainstream Comics.”) Mr. Aldama said he’s taking the lead of his students: “They feel so empowered by this term, it’s hard not to follow them.”
But as the popularity of the words grows, so does the debate over their value. Some critics reject Latinx and Chicanx for being foreign to the Spanish language, off-putting to the public or simply unnecessary.
The prominent Chicano artist Lalo Alcaraz, the creator of the comic strip La Cucaracha (who is not in any P.S.T. show), says he is not a fan of the construction.
“As a writer, I feel like these words are so clumsy and artificial. The ‘x’ looks like a mathematical annotation. I feel like language should be more organic,” he said. Mr. Alcaraz explained that he uses the words Latino, Latina, “la raza” or “brown people” — “I mix it up.”
Chon Noriega, head of the Chicano Studies Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a curator of the P.S.T. show “Home — So Different, So Appealing,” has also resisted using the new language.
“My sense is that it’s a maneuver within a stable category,” he said. “We can change the name, whether it’s Mexican-American, Chicana/o or Chicanx — but the category itself is not really changing.
For Mr. Noriega, the pressing question is whether curators’ interest in the word — or for that matter, in art of the Latin diaspora — will last much longer than Pacific Standard Time.
“Suddenly I see museums that never thought about having a Chicano art exhibition use the term ‘Chicanx.’
“In five years, if they haven’t had any Chicano shows,” he added, “we’d know it was just an accommodation.”"

‘In the Heights’ Canceled in Australia Over Whitewashing Concerns
By Diana Oliva Cave

SYDNEY, Australia — Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musicals are now a global phenomenon, bringing hip-hop and the American immigrant experience to theatergoers worldwide. But when producers in Brisbane, Australia, recently announced plans to stage “In the Heights” — a homage to Mr. Miranda’s Latino neighborhood in New York — promotional posters announcing the cast caused an uproar.
The problem: Everyone appeared to be white.
“Calling the casting of this show ‘whitewashed’ is an understatement,” wrote Chris Peterson, founder and editor in chief of OnStage Blog, whose post led to a dramatic backlash that stretched across continents. “It might as well be a mass-bleaching of the show with how they cast these roles with white and non-Latinx performers.” (“Latinx” is a genderless version of the word Latino.)
And with that, Australia’s struggles with cultural sensitivity in media and the arts were thrust onto the world stage, shaming a small theater company into answering the complaints of Mr. Miranda’s outraged American fans, and intensifying this country’s own debate about identity and representation in the arts.
This week, Matt Ward Entertainment, which had planned to present the musical in November as part of a cultural festival at Brisbane Powerhouse, a popular arts venue, canceled the show.
“The difficult decision to cancel the production came after careful consideration and community consultation,” Matt Ward said in an email. “We were also motivated by a duty of care to our cast and crew, many of whom were personally targeted online.”
He added that he chose to produce the musical in part because it “tells an important story which, as a proud multicultural society, many Australians can also identify with.”
But casting proved to be a challenge. Brisbane is the third-largest city in Australia, with a population of 2.27 million, but 78 percent of Greater Brisbane’s population speak only English at home and just 0.7 percent of the population speak Spanish.
Mr. Ward said he had expected that it would be hard to find a full Latino cast, and he noted that they were producing the show under a community licensing agreement.
“We were not bound by the specific casting conditions required of a professional production,” he said.
Mr. Ward said he and his team searched their local theater and community groups, contacted agents representing diverse actors and combed local hip-hop and salsa dance studios in search of cast members.
“While Brisbane has only a small Latinx community, and an even smaller community of Latinx musical theater performers,” Mr. Ward said, “we do have a rich and vast multicultural heritage, and this was proudly reflected in our casting of the work.”
But while one of the lead actresses, Stephie Da Silva, who was cast to play Vanessa, is Uruguayan, most of the other actors cast in top roles were not Latino and looked white. Usnavi, the character originally played by Mr. Miranda, was to be played by Jason Bentley.
The producers initially defended their casting decisions, pointing out in a statement that “50 percent of the cast identified with an ancestry other than Australian” — including Mr. Bentley, who is part Samoan.
But as the response to the show spread online and beyond, the producers decided to pull the plug.
Ms. Da Silva, the cast member who was born and raised in Uruguay, said she was disappointed to see the show canceled.
“This was a lesson for many,” she said, noting that minorities and actors involved in the show all ended up feeling hurt. She added: “It’s time to educate ourselves more when it comes to racial and cultural awareness.”
Criticism of Australia’s lack of diversity in media and the arts is increasingly common. In August, a Sydney-based women’s theater group, SheShakespeare, sparked a small firestorm when they posted their latest cast on Facebook. Again, they all appeared to be white.
“It’s really great to see so many white women get a chance,” commented Nakkiah Lui, an Australian Aboriginal writer and actress whose recent play, “Black Is the New White,” tackled some of Australia’s race issues.
But there have also been successes. When “In the Heights” debuted in Australia in 2015, produced by StageArts in Melbourne, the cast was more diverse and the show received good reviews."

Museums Turn Their Focus to U.S. Artists of Latin Descent
By Robin Pogrebin

When Scott Rothkopf, chief curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art, attended the U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium at the Ford Foundation two years ago, the experience had a profound impact.
The organizers “wanted to draw people’s attention to the fact that Latinx artists were falling into neither category — they were not part of the growing interest in Latin American artists but also not seen as American artists,” Mr. Rothkopf said. “I left thinking that it was extremely important that the Whitney expand its thinking in this area and, by virtue of being a museum of the U.S., could do something unique by drawing attention to these artists as U.S. Americans — they could be part of the story.”
Mr. Rothkopf then proceeded to hire Marcela Guerrero to be the Whitney’s first curator specializing in Latinx, the gender-neutral word for art produced by artists of Latin descent who were born in the United States, or work produced by artists of Latin descent in the United States.
“We’re at a really important point in history where plural curatorial voices can show not just a survey,” Ms. Guerrero said. “We can now go deeper and start unpacking what Latino art really is.”
On July 13, the Whitney will open the first major show curated by Ms. Guerrero, “Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay,” featuring works by indigenous groups including the Inca, Quechua, Maya, Aztec and Taino. The Whitney is also re-examining its collection historically. “We’ll be looking back at the whole of the 20th century and saying, ‘Who did we miss because of our biases, because of our ignorance?’” Mr. Rothkopf said. “‘Why don’t we have a Luis Jiménez sculpture?’ We have to answer questions like that.”
The Whitney’s efforts, including Ms. Guerrero’s appointment, are emblematic of a growing recognition by museums of the importance of the Latinx category.
As the Hispanic population continues to grow and immigration has become an increasingly hot-button political issue, art institutions around the country are beginning to increase their exhibitions, curators and acquisitions in Latinx art.
It is one of the many ways that museums are rethinking the traditional canon, and trying to fill in historical gaps in their collections and programming while also hoping to reach more diverse audiences in the process.
Ms. Guerrero is among the prominent figures in the art world who will be addressing this issue at The New York Times Art Leaders Network conference this week in Berlin, which will include discussions about how museums can play catch-up in areas they have long neglected, namely Latinx.
“More mainstream institutions are focusing on it,” said Marina Reyes Franco, an independent curator from Puerto_Rico. “It’s about time.”
To a large extent, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston has led the way, hiring its first curator of Latin American Art, Mari Carmen Ramírez, in 2001 when it established a department of Latino art. And when the museum’s new Steven Holl-designed expansion opens in 2020, Ms. Ramírez said, Latino art will have a dedicated presence.
Other institutions, including the Pérez Art Museum Miami, in Florida, El Museo del Barrio in New York and the Smithsonian, have also made noteworthy strides.
In addition to starting a Latino Curatorial Initiative, the Smithsonian has hired Latino experts at its museums, including the National Portrait Gallery, Archives of American Art, National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
And since E. Carmen Ramos became deputy chief curator and curator of Latino art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2010, the institution has doubled its collection of Latino art.
“Our focus is all about centering what had been a marginalized art community into the canon of American art,” said Eduardo Díaz, director of the Smithsonian Latino Center. “Latino art is American art, period.”
The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum’s Diseño series focuses on design and Latino identity. “This has been an area which has been neglected for so many years,” said Christina De León, an associate curator.
She added that the Cooper Hewitt’s recent renovation and reopening offered an opportunity “to rethink” the collection’s focus and the museum's direction. “In the end, we are here to serve the public,” Ms. De León said. “And if we can’t serve a diverse public, we’re not doing our job.”
To a large extent, the increasing attention to Latinx has been driven by demographics, those in the field say. “The United States is on its way to becoming a Latino-dominant population,” said Ms. Ramírez.
There are also diverse groups within that demographic, experts point out — be they Cuban-Americans in Miami, for example, Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles, or Puerto_Ricans in New York.
In addition, institutions are recognizing the importance of acknowledging the influence of Latinx art on the rest of American culture. “In this historical moment, possibly the most urgent of all the contemporary art issues has to do with Latino and Chicano art,” said Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, a curator of “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985,” which was part of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA and recently opened at the Brooklyn Museum. “This is a political moment when it is absolutely necessary that we begin to truly understand how embedded Latino culture is in the very fabric of the United States.”
Still, many liken Latinx to where the Latin American art field was 20 years ago, given that it still lacks an effective infrastructure or sufficient auction house support.
“There are not that many collectors of that art — it’s an incipient market,” Ms. Ramírez said. “Museums need to take a step forward and start collecting this art in a serious way. It’s the only way you can create a class of collectors. When museums put their stamp of approval on this area, collectors will follow suit and the market will follow.”
When the Whitney presents its coming show curated by Ms. Guerrero, the museum will for the first time have wall text in Spanish as well as English. “This is, to me a long-term project — it’s not that we’re going on a short-term shopping spree or checking boxes,” Mr. Rothkopf said. “This is going to become part of the way we think as an institution.”"

‘Behold Death, Darkness, Chaos and the Void’
By Kim Kelly

The visual language of heavy metal is punctuated by certain age-old signifiers: denim, leather, bullet belts, long hair, black T-shirts with skeletal logos. Depending on how your night has gone, blood.
This unofficial uniform isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s a tribal marker that crosses national borders and language barriers, and serves as a means to separate us from them — the heshers from the squares.
Steve Proana, who lives in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Queens, understands the importance of finding that perfect band shirt. He became a collector eight years ago, after unearthing a 1987 Megadeth tour tee in an old Manhattan thrift shop. He frequently posts about his prodigious collection of metal memorabilia on social media and occasionally sells pieces of it.
“Owning old-school metal shirts is like holding a piece of history,” Mr. Proana said. One of the hallmarks of heavy metal fandom is its reverence for the past; even as the genre continues to evolve and progress, ’80s thrash and ’90s death metal bands remain in heavy rotation and continue to find new fans.
“It is a statement of what we are and what we always will be, and that is staying true to our old-school metal roots,” he said, his feet clad in the kind of puffy white high-top sneakers favored by the members of Slayer, Sepultura and Anthrax. Mr. Proana’s home is packed with cherished totems from a bygone era — racks of sneakers, Bolt Thrower patches, rare Demolition Hammer T-shirts — that spill over into his shop.
New York City’s metal clubs are concentrated primarily in Brooklyn and Manhattan. But in Queens — with its large community of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexico and Central and South American countries — clubs like Blackthorn 51, in Elmhurst, and Sabor Norteño, in Corona, form a nexus for the borough’s small but fiercely dedicated D.I.Y. metal scene.
Maca Buritica was born in Bogotá, Colombia, and moved to Florida when she was 10. There, she learned how to play guitar at age 15 and was involved in several left-wing punk bands. After years spent singing about animal rights and women’s liberation down South, she moved to New York City in 2014, picked up a bass and joined the Queens black metal band Nite Rite as a bassist in 2017.
The band’s music is heavily atmospheric, melodic and monochromatic, with occult overtones (audience members can expect to “behold death, darkness, chaos and the void” at a typical show) and a frosty Scandinavian mien that belies its progenitors’ South American origin.
Latinx clubs and shows booked by Latinx metal promoters are more likely to draw a Latinx crowd, Ms. Buritica said, but the music itself comes before any linguistic or cultural considerations. “Metal is definitely a universal language,” she said. “We personally sing in English with some songs in Spanish. However, our fluency in Spanish allows us to greatly connect to the Latinx metal scene.”
That these metalheads would gravitate toward spaces where Spanish is spoken freely and the phrase “Satanic Hispanic” (a slightly tongue-in-cheek moniker used in the metal community that Mr. Proana finds “entertaining” and Ms. Buritica thinks is ignorant) is nowhere to be heard makes sense, especially at a time when ICE raids and anti-immigrant rhetoric dominate American news headlines.
Moreover, Latinx clubs are an alternative to those that continue to host racist metal bands, some of which produce music and merchandise that perpetuate fascist ideologies. And for many of these metalheads, the clubs are close to home.
But metal’s cultural centers are quickly becoming a thing of the past. Music clubs throughout the five boroughs are dying at an alarming rate, and those that served the metal community have been hit especially hard, with multiple pivotal clubs closing in quick succession.
The metalheads who frequent the concert circuit in Sunnyside or Corona aren’t avoiding a trip to another borough; there’s hardly anywhere left for them — or any other fans of underground metal — to go.
When the Acheron, a metal haven in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, closed in 2016, it left a limited number of clubs that regularly host more extreme or lesser-known metal bands. Saint Vitus Bar, in Greenpoint, and Lucky 13, in Gowanus, have the most lively performance rosters, and both are in corners of Brooklyn not easily accessible by subway.
Bigger acts have more freedom of choice in terms of which clubs they're able to play, but to find the kind of raw, less-accessible metal that Mr. Proana, Ms. Buritica and their friends love, there are precious few options — which is why D.I.Y. shows held in bars and basements have become the lifeblood of their scene.
“It is hard already to make ends meet living in this expensive city, especially if you are an immigrant who is in the scene,” Mr. Proana said, noting that a lack of reliable public transportation also hamstrings working-class metal fans’ ability to travel to further-flung clubs. “I think it is crucial that people in the scene keep it D.I.Y. — because if not us, then who? Especially now that so many great venues are closing down, it’s devastating. However, despite such great losses, we must move forward and make the best of what little we have. Sometimes you just need a little spark to create a fire.”
That spark has indeed begun to spread beyond the borders of Queens. Mr. Proana’s death thrash band Skullsplitter regularly appears at clubs around New York, and Ms. Buritica’s band recently played Lucky 13, in Brooklyn. She and her bandmate Jeff Monge are planning a multiday festival at Saint Vitus called Metal Punk Death Fest, which is scheduled for September.
They both urge metalheads from across the city to be more supportive of their local scenes, to show up for smaller touring bands who skip Brooklyn, and to not be afraid to take a longer ride on the subway or the bus in order to discover something magical.
“I think that any band that tries to keep the scene alive in their hometowns contributes into the American metal scene in some way, and I think that’s something very special,” Mr. Proana said."

‘Vida’ Flips the Script on Gentrification
By Robert Ito

Gentrification may have become one of this country’s most nettlesome civic issues, but you’d hardly know it judging from what’s been on TV.
In sitcoms and dramas set from Brooklyn to East L.A., the topic is played largely for laughs (think Abbi’s dope-fueled romp through her neighborhood’s new Whole Foods on “Broad City”), and typically takes a supporting role in a larger narrative (HBO’s “Insecure,” Netflix’s “She’s Gotta Have It”). The gentrifier himself — and yes, he’s most often a guy — is instantly recognizable, complete with a flannel shirt, fixie bike and gourmet coffee cup.
In “Vida,” a Starz series debuting May 6 that revolves around two Mexican-American sisters, Emma (Mishel Prada) and Lyn (Melissa Barrera), the subject is no longer just comic fodder, but a central part of the six-episode, 30-minute drama. And the show’s gentrifiers aren’t the usual clueless white hipsters. In “Vida,” they’re Mexican-American, and the core of the cast.
In the first episode, a slick real estate developer in Boyle Heights tries to persuade Emma, a successful management consultant in Chicago, to sell a building owned by her recently deceased mother. In place of mom’s dive bar and low-rent apartments, the developer sees pricey condos. Who cares if her tenants, most of them undocumented, end up on the street? Not the developer, who, like Emma, is Mexican-American, and grew up in the neighborhood. “Look at us, and look at them,” he tells Emma. “We took off the nopal from our foreheads.”
“Nopal en la frente [literally, cactus on your forehead] is the most racist thing you can say,” said Tanya Saracho, the show’s creator and showrunner. “He’s saying those people are indigenous, and we’re closer to white.”
Closer to white, but not. “They’re gente-fiers,” Ms. Saracho said, using a term to describe upwardly mobile Latinos who are transforming their new communities. “They go back to their neighborhoods, or maybe they’re not even from the neighborhoods, but they happen to be Latinx. It’s still gentrification, but it’s even more egregious, maybe, because it’s us.”
On a recent morning, Ms. Saracho was at her office in Hollywood here, apologizing if she wasn’t “super up” (she was, very much so), because she had taken melatonin the night before to help her sleep. Her office and nearby writing room are decorated with framed images of Frida Kahlo and Selena, and posters in favor of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by the local artist/activist Julio Salgado. There’s a throw pillow on the couch that says “Chingona,” and lit candles and potted succulents everywhere. “I have an all Latinx writers room,” she said, using a gender-neutral word for Latino and Latina. “I have one male writer, and the rest are female identified.”
Over coffee and mini-conchas brought from a nearby Mexican bakery, Ms. Saracho described her experiences growing up in nine different port towns by the time she was nine (“my dad worked for Mexican customs”), her family’s move to Texas when she was 12 (“I thought I spoke English, but then found out I didn’t”), her playwriting career in Chicago (where she founded the theater group Teatro Luna), and her eventual relocation to Los Angeles in 2012 to work on series like “Looking” and “How to Get Away with Murder.”
”Vida” grew out of an assignment in early 2016, when she was tasked by Starz to develop a series about “chipsters” — a term for Chicano hipsters which can either be endearing or biting, depending on who’s saying it — and the topic of gentefication (see previous note on “chipsters”).
There was a lot to consider, Ms. Saracho said. Do Mexican Americans who return to their old neighborhoods still have a right to dictate what goes on there? Does wanting less crime and better roads automatically make you a chipster? Can one be simultaneously Latinx and vegan?
“It’s complicated,” she said. “And I have to see all the sides.”
The topic of gentrification has popped up on several recent shows, including series set in Inglewood (HBO’s “Insecure”), North Oakland (the web series “The North Pole”), Boyle Heights (the web series “Gente-fied,” which is being adapted into a series for Netflix) and Brooklyn (the Tracy Morgan comedy on TBS, “The Last O.G.,” and the web series “aka Wyatt Cenac” and “Brooklynification”).
As in “Vida,” many of the gentrifiers in this new wave of shows are people of color, a change from the recent TV past in shows like “Portlandia” and “Girls.” In “Gente-fied,” the chef bringing artisanal tacos to Boyle Heights is a Latino local and one of the ensemble comedy’s central figures. In “The North Pole,” the guy in plaid who just took a job with GreenGos, an eco-friendly start-up, is African-American, and one of the show’s trio of stars.
And even when the gentrifiers are white, show creators have managed to tweak the model. When Gloria Calderon Kellett and Mike Royce first envisioned the character of Schneider on their reboot of “One Day at a Time,” they saw a quinoa-eating, mansplaining guy in flannel and thermals. “Our first conception of him was the handsome ugly American,” Mr. Royce said. As the show progressed, however, he has become a far more sympathetic and fleshed-out character.
“The hipster in TV narratives tend to be white, even though hipsters obviously come in all ethnicities,” said Daniel Makagon, a communication studies professor at DePaul who has written extensively about gentrification and the media. “I don’t think we’ve seen many shows where the gentrifiers are minorities, so it’ll be interesting to see if that starts to become more of a narrative.”
One major issue in “Vida” is the impact that gentrification — or, in this case, gentefication — has on the locals. Chelsea Rendon plays Marisol, a fearless anti-gentrification vlogger and community activist who calls out injustice, hypocrisy or just plain bouginess wherever she sees it. For the role, Ms. Rendon drew from her own experiences growing up in East L.A.
“I was like, how would I react if El Mercadito was gone and they put up a Walmart?,” she said. “Or if Tamales Liliana’s wasn’t there anymore, and they put up a Starbucks. If those places were gone, it would be heartbreaking.”
As the overassimilated, non-Spanish-speaking Lyn, Ms. Barrera plays one of Marisol’s chief foils, even though the actress is just about as far from the character she plays as one can get. Ms. Barrera speaks — and sings — fluent Spanish, having acted in films, plays and telenovelas in her native Mexico. And she wasn’t nearly as familiar with Lyn’s hometown Boyle Heights, which is why she went on several Eastside excursions once she got cast. “I could feel the warmth of the people, how welcoming they were,” she said. “It felt like I was walking around Mexico City.”
Indeed, in many ways, Boyle Heights has become a character in the series, and Ms. Saracho has spoken with residents and community groups in the effort to get things right. She’s also tackled several issues besides gentefication that haven’t historically gotten a lot of play on series TV, including homophobia in the Mexican-American community and how Latinos can’t tell Asians apart (the signage for mom’s dive bar, “La Chinita,” has a geisha on it).
Even so, Ms. Saracho said, the series isn’t a polemic. There are sisterly squabbles and hilarious trash talk, much of it in Spanish, as well as moments of extreme tenderness and jerks being jerks. “The show is about gentefication, but it shouldn’t hit you over the head,” she said. “In the end, it’s about the girls.”"

Chocolate Factory Unveils Final Season in Its Current Home
By Peter Libbey

In its last season in its Long Island City home, the Chocolate Factory will present work by Melanie Maar, Miguel Gutierrez, Niall Jones and others, the organization announced on Monday. The Chocolate Factory bought a permanent facility in the area last year, and it aims to reopen in 2020.
“This season is about blurring the lines between process and product — by supporting creative residencies and fully produced works on the same level,” Brian Rogers, the artistic director at the Chocolate Factory, said by email. “It’s always more about the process of creation, for me, than the result.”
Ms. Maar will present a new phase of her “Line Dance Death” project, Oct. 3-6. (The first phase was in May at the Chocolate Factory’s un-renovated future home.) The new one, a collaboration with Kenta Nagai and Madeline Best, will explore the irregular structure of the creative process. The final two segments will come in the 2019-20 season. (Programming for that season will be held at various locations before the new theater opens.)
A new piece by Mr. Gutierrez, commissioned by the Chocolate Factory, will be presented as a part of the American Realness festival. Using popular Latin-American music, the form of the telenovela, and choreography that blends individual and group movement, six Latinx performers will investigate the concepts of identity and difference.
Niall Jones will close the season in May with “Untitled Fantasies in Low Fade” (working title), which focuses on transition and fragility.
The Chocolate Factory will screen Mr. Rogers’s first feature film, “Screamers,” on Aug. 24 and Aug. 25, at the Abrons Arts Center’s playhouse. Described as a “conceptual ghost story” in a news release, the film features dance and theater artists from New York’s experimental scene.
The Chocolate Factory will also host several works in progress during its 2018-19 season, including pieces by Iele Paloumpis, Stephanie Acosta and Jess Pretty, as part of a residency organized by Blaze Ferrer."

At ‘Uptown Bounce,’ Salsa Dancing and So Much More
By Melissa Smith

Salsa and Latin disco music had people twirling and swiveling their hips on Wednesday night at “Uptown Bounce,” the first of four weekly block parties presented by El Museo del Barrio and the Museum of the City of New York, neighbors on the northern end of Museum Mile. Salsa was created by Cuban and Puerto_Rican immigrants in East Harlem during a period in the 1960s of profound social change, so the organizers saw fit to focus their programming on the struggles facing Latinx people today.
A day of rain forced the festivities inside this week, but that didn’t dampen the spirits of the dancer Franck Muhel, whose dynamic footwork was on display, or of those dancing underneath an installation titled “Starlight,” by the Cooper Joseph Studio, now at the Museum of the City of New York. That museum hosted Mujeres en Movimiento, an advocacy group of Spanish-speaking mothers, who provided information on immigration programs.
Just across 104th Street, at El Museo del Barrio, the arts collective Sociedad organized a three-part exhibition that included a room set up as a Caribbean social club — with a pool table, dominoes and an area to smoke cigars. One artist’s installation was a nod to the old photo studio his grandmother used to stage photographs that she would then send to her family in Puerto_Rico. In the museum’s atrium, the windows were partly covered with signs from the “Families Belong Together” protests last month.
Before settling in to D.J. the evening’s last hour, Loira Limbal, a.k.a. DJ Laylo — from “A Party Called Rosie Perez,” a D.J. collective celebrating traditional Latinx club culture — and other panelists discussed the negative effects gentrification can have on Latinx communities.
As the end of the night approached, attendees reveled in the richness of the Latinx culture that preceded this one all while thrumming güiras and shaking tambourines and maracas to the merengue and salsa music that was blasting from the speakers. The festivities ended with a reminder that “Uptown Bounce” will return next Wednesday, when, weather permitting, the festivities will take place outdoors, and female empowerment will be the focus of the programming."

Overlooked by the Media, Women Like Me Took to Instagram
By Natasha S. Alford

I was about 11 years old when I started to think I wasn’t like the other Latina girls.
The summer before sixth grade, my mother put me in a beauty pageant sponsored by a Hispanic community organization in Syracuse, N.Y., where we lived. The stage wasn’t fancy — it was in a gymnasium on the West Side, one of the poorest areas of the city. But there was a lot at stake. The winner would represent the pride of the community during the Puerto_Rican Day Festival parade.
I was mortified at the idea of competing. Aside from being a nerd with thick plastic glasses and a school marching band membership to match, I didn’t look Latina. At least not compared with my pageant competitors or the women and girls I saw in the media.
Latinas in movies, TV and magazines were always fair-skinned.
Latinas had long blonde or brown hair that was straight or wavy.
Latinas spoke Spanish, and they spoke it fast and well.
Latinas had small noses and mostly European-looking features.
I, on the other hand was a brown-skinned girl, with big black frizzy hair and a full nose, thanks to a dark-skinned African-American dad and a fairer-skinned Puerto_Rican mom. I spoke fluent English, but much less Spanish — and was too afraid to risk being laughed at to  try.
Did I even count as Latina? Despite my parents’ insistence and constant reminders that I was — they would celebrate El Día de los Reyes (Three Kings Day) in addition to Christmas, buy bilingual books and teach me traditional salsa dances — I had serious doubts.
Miraculously, my uncertainty didn’t show up in my careful walk down the runway. Thanks to the poofy-sleeved orange gown my mom bought for me from a local thrift store, the saxophone routine I’d practiced ad nauseam and my ability to keep cool during the question-and-answer portion (during which I required a translator), I won the pageant.
But instead of relishing the opportunity to ride in a convertible and wave to fans wearing a tiara, I was self-conscious. Would people on the parade route be whispering about whether I was on the wrong float, or questioning how I’d managed to take the crown? After all, I’d rarely seen anyone who looked like me be recognized as a Latina — let alone as a beautiful Latina.
Today, I have. And it’s thanks in large part to the internet.
I now know that I belong to a much larger community of Afro-Latinas (or Afro-LatinX people) around the globe, who are not only African descendants, but are also proud of it. We exist in places from Brazil to Venezuela, Panama to Puerto_Rico, and Colombia to the Dominican_Republic.
Learning this as a young adult was important intellectually. But when it comes to my sense of belonging, there’s something else that’s helped emotionally: Instagram. Sure, a handful of Afro-Latinas in mainstream media do exist — women like the lawyer and commentator Sunny Hostin, the actress Gina Torres and VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop Miami” star and singer Amara La Negra, who has campaigned against colorism in the Latino community — but they’re few and far between. Filling the gaps are digital communities of Afro-Latina women. We are purposely recognizing  one another in ways we’ve never found in popular media representations and sharing images and stories that redefine the narrow Eurocentric definition of Latinidad many of us have consumed for years.
Instagram accounts like @afrolatinas_ and @AintILatina post photos of Afro-Latinas of all hues, showcasing them wearing thick curls, Afros or locs, with uplifting messages and quotations about self-love.
“Claim your space,” one image posted by @afrolatinas_ reads. “Belleza ésta negrita/Black is beautiful,” reads another. It’s a necessary reminder for many Afro-Latinas like me who haven’t always felt that way.
“I was really going about life trying to figure out who I was,” said Amanda Pericles, the Dominican-American creator of @afrolatinas_.
In 2015, she started finding and posting photos of Afro-Latina women embracing their hair texture. She attracted thousands of followers. “I’m trying to make it a point to show people we have differences here and there, but we’re all black,” she says.
I’m not the only one who’s found a sense of belonging on the image-sharing platform.
“With social media is when I started to hear the terms LatinX and Afro-Latino and I started to differentiate — ‘So I’m a black Puerto_Rican,’” Cynthia Branch, an Afro Puerto_Rican who grew up around mostly light-skinned Latinas, said at an April meetup of Afro-Latinas in Harlem promoted  through the @Blactina account.
These women’s perspectives reflect what I eventually learned in college years after that beauty pageant: that it’s O.K. — and more than that, something to celebrate — to be both black and Latina. While doing research for my senior thesis, I discovered two Afro Puerto_Rican female reggaeton artists, La Sista and La Hill. La Sista wore dreadlocks and African-print clothes and called her album “Majestad Negroide” (black majesty). La Hill had deep, rich chocolate skin and declared in one song, “a dios gracias por darme este color” (thanks be to God for giving me this color). I tracked down their contact information and flew from Boston to New York City and Puerto_Rico to interview them.
I’m grateful for that life-changing journey 10 years ago. I’m also grateful that, now, access to women who embrace what I called a “morena consciousness” is only a click — rather than a plane ticket — away.
Instagram is often criticized for showcasing unrealistic lifestyles that can make users feel insecure. But for me, it plays a different role. It’s a place where I can go for much-needed reminders that, despite what mainstream media might suggest, my kind of beauty matters. It’s where I can lose myself in photos that prove there’s a place where I belong."

How Small Business Owners Are Keeping el Día de los Muertos Alive in Dallas
By Concepción de León

At the end of 2016, in between jobs and ready for a change, I moved back to the Dominican_Republic for a few months. Every night at my tía’s home in Santo Domingo, I watched her and the other women and girls on my dad’s side of the family brush out their curls, braid their hair and wrap it into the same Princess Leia-style buns to sleep. They’d inherited this bedtime ritual from my grandmother, who died in the early ’90s and whose long mane of pelo bueno was legend in my family. (Ugh. I know. But even if it shouldn’t be a thing, it still is.) I envied the shared communion of this small gesture, which I’d never witnessed growing up in New York: their jalones had historia.
Inevitably, we leave parts of ourselves behind when we emigrate — traditions that are too hard to keep up; foods for which the right sazón is nearly impossible to find. But Mexican-Americans (and Pixar) have taken the Day of the Dead and made it a distinct part of American culture too. In many cities, especially those with large Chicano populations like Houston and Los Angeles, altars honoring deceased ancestors and loved ones with food and mementos have popped up on street corners and in shops in advance of the holiday on Nov. 2.
In Dallas, for example, where about a third of the population is Hispanic and primarily of Mexican descent, Maroches Bakery, in the Bishops Arts District neighborhood, has become known for its Day of the Dead community altar.  
Each year, Manuel Tellez, who has run the shop for 18 years, asks local artists to contribute, and invariably, they turn up with painted tequila bottles, vibrant skull drawings and lucha libre homages.
When I spoke to Tellez on the phone, he was busy fielding orders for the Day of the Dead’s signature pan de muerto, a sweet roll brushed with egg wash and dusted with sugar. “We open at 1,” he was telling a customer. “The bread will be ready by 6.”
Tellez is insistent on making pan de muerto the traditional way, without any artificial ingredients to speed up the process. It’s part of his effort to keep Mexican culture alive in a quickly gentrifying city. When the customer in the shop seemed to grumble about the wait, Tellez simply said: “That’s how you roll in this area.”
Tellez moved to the United States when he was 18, and though his family did not celebrate the Day of the Dead when he was growing up, he adopted the custom as a nod to his heritage. “Convertí la pastelería en un lugar más multifacético,” Tellez said, referring to his reimagining of the bakery as a cultural space where locals can discuss arts or politics.
Both Tellez and Cindy Pedraza Puente, who co-owns CocoAndré, a Mexican chocolatier that creates artisanal chocolates for the Day of the Dead in Dallas, said that not everyone in their community embraces the tradition wholeheartedly. Pedraza Puente said her mother was a Sunday school teacher and some of her fellow congregants — many of whom were second- and third-generation immigrants — found it hard to reconcile their Catholic faith with the Day of the Dead traditions. When the animated movie “The Book of Life” came out in 2014, Pedraza Puente said she noticed that more people wanted to dress up like the movie’s characters, but she hopes to teach people that the Day of the Dead “isn’t a costume.”
“This is an actual tradition with roots, and it means something,” she said. In its honor, she throws an annual party attended by hundreds of people.
Fred Villanueva, another Dallas local who owns AshStudios (which he described as “a black and brown space”), said that he attempted “to show great respect to the Aztec and the Mayan codices that came before us” through the altar he created for the Latino Cultural Center, adding that part of his offering was the artwork itself."

John Leguizamo Has Harsh Words for Us
By Concepción de León

WE’RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTIONS
Early indicators show that voting in the midterms was up among women, Latinos and young people. (“Donde votar” was Google’s top search term on Election Day morning.) And a record-breaking number of women, people of color and young people were elected. But midterm madness isn’t over; as of this morning, Florida and Georgia are still counting votes and many municipalities are wrestling with the fact that election centers were overcrowded or had voting machines that didn’t work. (At my polling location in Queens, I saw one of the volunteers hurriedly help a woman fill out a provisional ballot, then fold it and toss it onto an increasingly unwieldy pile.)
The Democrats won back a majority in the House and Republicans maintained control of the Senate, gaining a few more seats. If you’re wondering, “What does it all mean?” we’ve got you.
Also in politics, a bit of good news for “Dreamers”: On Thursday, a federal appeals court ordered that DACA recipients would remain protected from deportation while legal challenges to the Trump administration’s attempts to end the program are pending in several states.
A CHAT CON EL PROFESOR
In news unrelated to midterms: John Leguizamo’s “Latin History for Morons” is now streaming on Netflix following a successful run in 2017 in New York at the Public Theater and on Broadway. I saw the play in April of last year, right before my first day at The Times, and the version on Netflix is even sharper and more incisive than I remember, showcasing a type of harsh, honest humor that’s distinctly Latinx.
In the show, Leguizamo takes on the role of a professor attempting to find a Latinx hero for his son to research for a middle school project. “That’s how it happened in real life,” he said in a phone call this week. “My son needed a historical hero for a school project, and there weren’t any in his textbook. So I started reading, doing research.”
The history lesson that ensues is frenetic and animated, with Leguizamo jumping from Christopher Columbus’s decimation of the Taíno people in the Caribbean to the present “age of Pitbull,” all while doing impressions, cursing in Spanish and dancing merengue.
Growing up in Queens, Leguizamo, who is half Colombian and half Puerto_Rican, only learned about Latinx history “through osmosis,” he said. “Hanging out, I saw how brilliant and how funny and how sharp and how savvy our people were, but I wasn’t learning it in school. I was in public school, and it wasn’t in the textbooks.”
So as part of the show’s rollout, Leguizamo released a syllabus on Twitter, recommending more than 60 books on Latinx history and social justice, including Eduardo Galeano’s “Open Veins of Latin America,” Charles Mann’s “1491” and Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States” — his favorites.
“They state our powers and our contributions,” Leguizamo said of these books. “How much was destroyed and how much has been exploited and how with the incredible amount of resources and power we have, why are we powerless?”
He also talked scathingly about underrepresentation of Latinx people in the media. “We’re less than 3 percent of the faces in front of the camera,” Leguizamo said. “We’re 35 percent of the population of New York City. White people are 35 percent of the population of New York City. We’re equal. And yet The New York Times rarely, if ever, has positive, Latin aspirational stories in any section. And that, I find, a cultural apartheid.” (Latinos make up 29 percent of New York City’s population, while non-Hispanic whites make up 32 percent.)
What’s next? Maybe he’ll write a book of his own. “That’ll be my life’s work,” he said.
JENNIFER LOPEZ LEVELS UP
Jennifer Lopez (the queen of romantic comedies; fight me!) talked to The Times ahead of her upcoming film, “Second Act,” which is out Dec. 21. 
I stan for Lopez as an actress: “The Wedding Planner,” the 2001 rom-com which features Lopez as, you know, a wedding planner, was my favorite movie until “Maid in Manhattan” (Lopez, a hotel maid, becomes Lopez, a politician’s love interest) came out in 2002. Suffice to say, I will be seeing “Second Act” on opening day.
In the profile, Lopez talks about pushing herself in her career, going to therapy and trying to teach her daughter self-love and that “she don’t need no fairy tale.” There are also several paragraphs of Alex Rodriguez hyping her up, which gave me heart-eye emoji vibes.
But one of her comments gave me pause. In “Second Act,” Lopez plays Maya de la Vargas, a 40-something assistant manager at a big box store in Queens who has bigger dreams. Our reporter wrote that the movie “glosses over the institutional and social hurdles that a character like Maya might face,” adding:
To Lopez, that is another instance where mind-over-matter determination should prevail. She was a Puerto_Rican from the middle-class Bronx with aspirations far beyond that, and a tenacity that made it happen. “There is racism. There is sexism. There is ageism. There is all of this and you know what, that’s still not going to stop me,” she said. “I believe that 100 percent, to the bottom of my soul.”
So essentially, Lopez doesn’t see any flaw in the movie’s premise, because she subscribes to the central message: Anything can be accomplished with sheer force.
I get it: I’m the first of my American raised primos and siblings to go to college and, to their great annoyance, this means I’m the standard to which they’re frequently held. My relative success is used as a counterexample for anyone else’s perceived failures, the idea being: If Concepción did it, why can’t they? It’s a symptom of a mind-set called survivorship bias, whereby the survivors (i.e., the people who have “made it”) are viewed as the rule rather than the exception, a worldview that ignores the substantially greater numbers of people who aren't able to overcome limiting circumstances. It places the burden of success on the individual without recognizing, let alone tackling, the systemic barriers that hold marginalized people back, according to many, many studies and reports. It’s fine to gloss over inequality in romantic comedies, (O.K., maybe not fine but personally, I don’t mind two hours of optimistic escapism). But in real life, nuance matters.

What It Means to Be ‘Latinx,’ and What That Means for America
By Julian Castro

In September, just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary recognized the word “Latinx,” which it defines as “of, relating to or marked by Latin American heritage — used as a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.” I was happy to see the addition, and also more than a little amused. I thought back to my freshman year of college in 1992. As I sat in a computer room in my dorm working away on an early Macintosh, a red squiggly line immediately appeared underneath the word “Chicano” after I typed it into the paper I was writing about my family’s background. When I hit the spell check to see what the problem was, Microsoft Word had a suggestion: Chicago. “You don’t even exist,” popped into my head. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a new experience. Years earlier, in middle school, I’d been asked to fill out a form that included a question about my background. There were three options to choose from: black, white or other. “Well, I’m not black or white,” I remember thinking, pencil in hand, “but I don’t like the sound of ‘other.’” I left it blank.
For many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In “Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,” Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America’s Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.
Reading Morales’s dissection of Latinx identity formation, however, one begins to believe that the x in “Latinx” is more than just a means of providing gender-neutrality. As in algebra, the x is variable. How a Latino or Latina perceives himself or herself — and how he or she is perceived by others — often depends on context. Unhappy with the binary notion of race popular in the United States, Morales offers the concept of mestizaje, or hybridity, that encompasses a spectrum of identity, the result of hundreds of years of intermixing among African, European and indigenous peoples in Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Latinos can be black, white, brown or anything in between. Skin color, national origin, whether one lives in the mainland United States or outside of it, and one’s ability to speak Spanish, not to mention gender and sexual orientation, all play a role in one’s self-concept.
Morales, an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University who describes his own identity as that of a “racialized person living in a U.S. megacity, who has a somewhat ambiguous phenotypical appearance,” proves refreshingly introspective, weaving enough personal biography into the book to pull the work back from veering too far into inaccessible academic jargon. “In my own extended family, there is generally a disdain for blackness,” he writes, and tells of his father, who “traded on Anglo-Americans’ perceptions of his whiteness if it helped him in financial or social transactions, yet sought to avoid complete identification with whiteness when it came to his ‘real’ identity.”
According to the 2010 census, there were 55 million Latinos in the United States, and they made up 23 percent of Americans under the age of 18. Today, although Asian-Americans are now growing more quickly in percentage terms, Latinos are still growing fastest numerically. That means the destiny of the United States and the destiny of the Latino community are powerfully intertwined.
“The American identity will never be fixed and final; it will always be in the making,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote a quarter century ago in “The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society.” While Schlesinger’s observation may be true, it is much easier asserted than accepted.
With his boogeyman approach to electoral politics, Donald Trump has deftly exploited anxieties about the impact of America’s changing demographics on our national identity, and no group has been more vilified by Trump for political purposes than Latinos. After declaring in his announcement speech that Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners to our country, months later Trump dismissed questions about the legitimacy of fraud claims against Trump University by insisting that the American-born judge of Mexican descent who was presiding over the case could not do his job right because “he’s Mexican!” His administration has been even worse, cruelly separating families apprehended at the Southern border, failing to adequately respond to Hurricane Maria and then dismissing the deaths of 3,000 Puerto_Ricans as mere fantasy concocted by political opponents.
It is no surprise, then, that the Latino community is widely misperceived and is especially in need today of voices to defend and humanize it. In this way, “Latinx” couldn’t be timelier. For one thing, Morales shatters Americans’ view of the community as monolithic. Although nearly two-thirds of Latinos claim Mexican heritage, Puerto_Ricans, Cubans and a growing community of Latinos from Central and South America each have unique cultural and political experiences in the United States.
Morales explores these to varying degrees, and, importantly, makes clear that Latinos have been integral to America’s progress for generations, even as they have grappled with relative invisibility, outright rejection of their place in America and internal struggles about their own identity. He reminds us that it was Gonzalo and Felícitas Méndez, the Mexican-born father and Puerto_Rican mother of daughter Sylvia Mendez, who challenged California’s separate and unequal “Mexican schools,” winning an appellate court victory in 1946 that paved the way for the Supreme Court’s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education that struck down racial segregation in schools eight years later.
Morales’s writing can be hyperbolic at times. “For an American economy that has been largely stagnant, the opening of Cuba is a last-ditch opportunity to stave off looming worldwide economic disaster,” he writes of President Obama’s efforts to open up Cuba to American investment. Still, the book’s deep dive into the crosscurrents of Latinx identity is a powerful reminder that, as Americans wrestle with questions about who is and who is not “American” — and, indeed, questions about what it means to be an American in the 21st century — the nation can benefit immensely from the robust inclusion and understanding of a community that has spent generations grappling with nearly every facet of its own identity."

Another Hot Take on the Term ‘Latinx’

El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ¿Lo mejor? It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).
The paradox of working in media is that even as your mind expands, your world also shrinks a bit. Because of my job, I read a lot of news, then go on Twitter to read people’s hot takes, then listen to podcasts, you know, just to round out the picture. It’s extra, for sure. But while there’s no question that my understanding of topics like foreign relations, economics and the president’s taxes, to name a few, has gone from zero to at least 80 in the last few years, the overexposure has also distorted my perception about what “everyone” knows.
Fortunately our readers keep me accountable. In my last column, for example, I used the word “Latinx” as a broader term for the Latino community, to some people’s perplexity.
¿Latin-qué?
Latinx (pronounced la-TEEN-ex), meant to be a more feminist, inclusive term that also considers transgender folks or those who don’t identify with the gender binary, has started to pop up more frequently in recent years. So many explainers and articles and videos have been created about why it should or should not be used. The phrase is widely adopted on college campuses and by activists, and in September, Merriam-Webster added it to the dictionary. But many are still critical of the word, and they expressed as much in our Facebook comments.
In part, it’s a linguistic issue: Latinx just doesn’t translate to Spanish, some argued. A commenter from Ohio wrote that, if you’re a Spanish speaker, “the term Latinx reads like a thousand nails in a thousand blackboards.” Some readers in Latin America said it was an Anglicization that wasn’t relevant in their home countries. Another implied that the term is elitist, writing that the word Latinx “ostracizes all the speakers of Spanish who don’t have wealth or time to pontificate the ‘oppression’ of a language which at its very root genders everything.” In a very official poll on my personal Facebook page, some friends and family said that they’d never even heard of it.
So, should it be used at all?
Linguists have mixed feelings.
Kim Potowski, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in Spanish linguistics, tried to employ inclusive language in a forthcoming Spanish grammar book, but replacing the masculine “O” throughout overwhelmed her and her co-writer, Naomi L. Shin. “It came to a point where we said, ‘You know what, we’re not ready,’” she said. Maybe in the fourth or fifth edition of the book, she added, “we will have those X’s in there.”
“There is absolutely no consensus among linguists,” said Dr. Potowski.
Another scholar, Lourdes Torres, a professor of Latino studies at DePaul University in Chicago, argues that the word Latinx undermines hard-fought feminist battles. “In its attempt to be gender-inclusive,” she said, “one can argue that it’s gender-erasing of women who have fought for a long time to not just have Latino, but to have Latino/Latina, to make sure women are represented.”
But they do agree that language evolves with the culture.
“As social factors change, sometimes the language has to change,” said Dr. Torres. “The people who use the language are the ones who determine what it is.” She and Dr. Potowski both gave words like “presidenta” or “jefa” as examples; neither existed until women entered the work force and took on those roles.
Ed Morales, a Columbia University professor who wrote “Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,” agrees. In a recent conversation he said that “the X, which is so strange and is not Spanish, sort of marks this new hybrid idea.” The title of his book, similarly, was meant to be forward-looking. “I thought it was a futurist term,” he said, “imagining a future of more inclusion for people that don’t conform to the various kinds of rigid identities that exist in the United States.”
Still, the arbiter of Spanish is the Real Academia Española. That entity decides which words make it into the dictionary, and they’re not big fans of Spanglish or Spanish words developed in the United States. In 2012, they added a definition for “estadounidismo,” which translates to Americanism. At first, Dr. Torres said, the word was categorized as a “deformation of Spanish.” Linguists had to push for them to change the official entry.
Dialectical hierarchy is nothing new. Dominicans and Puerto_Ricans, for instance, are criticized for dropping word endings or using inventive slang. It’s significant that the Real Academia recognized American Spanish in its pages, but why is it widely perceived as being less valid than the Spanish dialects spoken in other countries?
Because American Spanish is for the youth.
Many young, American Latinos believe that Spain’s official ruling on language erases our African and indigenous roots in favor of European values. Some have argued that Latinx is partly a nod to the gender fluidity that existed among Natives before colonization.
Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, and many Hispanic adults feel that it is important for their succeeding generations to keep the language alive in this country. Inevitably, though, new words that meld Spanish and English will be introduced.
Both Dr. Morales and Dr. Torres said feminist and queer circles in Latin America are experimenting with their own terms. “We’re not creating this change in Latin America,” Dr. Torres said. “They recognize that their language, like all languages, is sexist. All languages are sexist because we live under the patriarchy everywhere.”
The value of the X is that it “provokes conversation about who we’re including and who we’re not including in our communities,” she said. But that doesn’t mean everybody has to use it.
“If you talk to my dad or my tía, that’s just another silly academic or political thing,” Dr. Torres said. “It’s definitely of a certain world.”
Still, she said, even if the terms are not always understood, it’s important to be “inclusive of all those identities that have had less visibility in our conversations, in our books, in our movies.” If we can, she said, “it would be a really powerful thing.”"

The Early Days of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
By Concepción de León

The other day, Jeff Roth, an editor at the Times in charge of our photo archives, came across some never-published images of the founders of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The subjects sought to build a creative, social space in the city for Puerto_Ricans, where patrons could bear witness to what the writer David Vidal called “a new, intensely cathartic poetry that was born on New York City's streets.”
The cafe is frequently packed on Friday nights. Outside, long lines of people wait to get into the weekly spoken word competitions, and many of the young faces in the audience and onstage are black or brown. For many spoken word performers of color — especially those of Latinx and black descent — the Nuyorican Poets Cafe is what the Comedy Cellar has been for stand-up comics: a place to cut their teeth and test the resonance of their work in front of a live audience.
It’s come a long way from its humble beginnings in a poet’s living room.
In the early 1970s, Miguel Algarín, born in Puerto_Rico but raised on the Lower East Side, began inviting other Nuyorican poets to his apartment on East Sixth Street for readings and performances. Algarín and his contemporaries, including Miguel Piñero, Pedro Pietri and Lucky CienFuegos, were part of a growing artistic scene in what was then a primarily Puerto_Rican neighborhood, drawing on their identities and daily struggles for their work. The salon quickly outgrew Algarín’s living room, so he and a few other artists began renting an Irish bar down the street to fit more people. In 1981, they bought their current building on East Third Street and, after a lengthy renovation process, formally opened it to the public in 1990 as a space for Nuyorican poets to experiment and hone their craft.
The photos, taken in 1976 by Paul Hosefros, show the excitement of the nascent collective as it expanded into its first storefront.
“Many of the founding artists and those who gravitated toward the group in the early days were informed by and active in a version of poetry that was much less academic, much less literary, much less elitist than many of the incarnations of poetry that existed in the ’60s and ’70s,” said Daniel Gallant, the cafe’s executive director, adding that even in its earliest days, it produced “poetry that evolved into and through injections of music, movement, theater, film and collaborative experience.”
That multidisciplinary, experimental spirit lives on today, and a number of award-winning one-person theatrical shows have evolved from spoken word performances developed there. Sarah Jones’s 2005 show “Bridge and Tunnel,” which won a Tony Award, and Elaine del Valle’s 2014 “Brownsville Bred” are standouts.
The Dominican-American poet Elizabeth Acevedo, who won the 2018 National Book Award for Young People’s Fiction, said she gave her first performance at the cafe when she was 15 and was only vaguely aware of “this important poetry place downtown.” “I did a rap song,” said Acevedo, now 30. “I knew music. I knew bolero songs and church songs and hip-hop. That was my origin.”
Caridad De La Luz, a Nuyorican poet who first performed at the club in 1996 and now hosts the Monday night Open Mics, also said she had only performed music (mostly Mary J. Blige covers on her college campus) before arriving at Nuyorican. The cafe expanded her view of what a poem could be. “Poetry was just something you wrote in journals for therapy,” she said. “Then when you got to the Nuyorican it was like, ‘Oh there’s a mic, there’s a stage, there’s an audience that wants to hear these things.’ Out came the journal.”
Acevedo said there’s a sense of “walking into a lineage” of other Latinx spoken word performers at the cafe. “Even as the poets get younger, you feel that there’s something being passed down,” she said.
She recalled learning about “declamación,” a cousin of spoken word poetry that is performed in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America. “What we name spoken word or slam or esto y lo otro, we have had names for,” she said. The magic of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe was how it blended old-world and new, Acevedo said. It was “this space that, yes, was in conversation with hip-hop. Yes, was in conversation with the beat poets. But was also in conversation with something that was inherently Puerto_Rican, inherently Caribbean, inherently Latinx.”

Valentina of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Is Back, Mi Amor!
By Concepción de León

“I feel like La Virgen de Guadalupe is my drag mom,” said Valentina, the 27-year-old Latinx queen of Season 9 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” before kissing a botanica candle dedicated to the Mexican patron saint. This was one of the many moments in which she invoked her Mexican heritage on the show, sprinkling references to María Félix, mariachis and Catholic bodas throughout the season. Valentina’s longevity in the competition made her a Latinx fan favorite (she’s not the first Latinx queen to compete, but she had one of the most successful runs on the show), and many were disappointed to see her eliminated after she forgot the words during a lip sync battle.
But good news! She’s back — this time, in the next season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars,” which premieres Dec. 14 on VH1. The performer, whose real name is James Leyva, also landed the role of Angel in “Rent: Live,” which will air on Fox on Jan. 27. During a rehearsal break, she talked with me about the challenges of being a Latinx drag queen, the “real tea” behind her elimination and the energy she brought to “All Stars.”
This interview has been edited and condensed.
How did you get started in drag?
I’ve always kind of been doing drag. When I was little and I would be taking a bath, I would drape the towel over my body in ways that played with gender without me really knowing it — making it a gown or a train or a hat or a shoulder piece or a cape. In college, I started to study dance, music and theater, and play with makeup. Then, having watched “Drag Race” and really loving the idea of putting an outfit together, thrift store shopping, getting a wig and thinking of a drag name got me really excited about it. Before my “Drag Race” season, I had been doing drag for roughly a year.
Were your parents supportive? I feel like there’s still a lot of stigma in the Latin American community when it comes to drag or men taking on traditionally feminine traits.
I do remember my dad correcting my feminine behavior, whether it be too emotional or too soft or just too flamboyant. When I finally decided to come out, it was a shock to my parents that I was gay, which is really odd to me, because I was studying the performing arts, and when I was in middle school I loved Britney Spears. I loved watching telenovelas with my babysitters. I loved glamour, and I would always hang out with my mom when she was getting ready.
They’ve come around, but it took some time. Sometimes we want to have the support of our parents right away, but for someone like me, who is Chicano, first-generation, we have to have patience with our parents. Sometimes they are coming from really closed-minded religious backgrounds or from a different country with laws that didn’t protect them. We have to not be so judgmental. Sometimes it takes them a while to turn around and see the bigger picture: that we are happy, that we are deserving of love, that we are just like anybody else.
Last year, a lot of fans were disappointed by your elimination. You were doing really well and were a favorite to win. But then during a lip sync for your life, you forgot the words. What happened there? And what did you learn from that experience?
There is this notion like “Maybe she refused to learn it,” or “She was lazy,” or “She didn’t care,” but no. It was some other song, and then it was switched the day before. That night, I had to go home and memorize Ariana Grande’s “Greedy.” I didn’t have the lyrics sheet with me, so I had to learn it by ear, and write down the lyrics as I went. I stayed up until like 3:30, and I had to be up at 6. I tried to learn the song. Before I went to sleep, I knew the song. By the time I woke up, I didn’t know the song.
People don’t acknowledge the fact that we are busy working the entire time. We are not just sitting there learning songs in our free time, because there is no free time. And so by the time it came time to perform, I was in such a state of shock and I freaked out. That is the real tea!
It was very difficult for me to process all that at the time. But once I calmed down, I was able to realize that all of the drama and all of my trauma aside, this is an iconic moment in reality TV. People are going to remember me for that — and good. It’s a problem when they don’t remember you, baby.
You made it a point during your season to showcase your Mexican heritage. Should we expect the same during “All Stars”?
I can never deny my culture. Even if I give you a simple black dress with some simple hair, I am imagining María Félix walking down a long hallway in my mind. On my season, I made it a plot to reference things that maybe people didn’t know. I was name dropping people and things that I found so beautiful, like Mariachi Plaza in Los Angeles and María Félix and the bridal look with my mom.
My upbringing, coming from a Latin family and being first generation — that is a really big part of everything. I just got to work with the Latina goddess, my childhood icon, Thalía, who I grew up watching on “Marimar” and “María Mercedes” and “María la del Barrio” and “Rosalinda.” I worked with Gloria Trevi. These are people I grew up idolizing. It is such a blessing, because what I am aiming for with my art is to be part of Latin excellence.
The reason I am coming back for “All Stars"" is for my fans. Because they missed me, and they wanted to see me. They want a brown person to go in, and they want them to take the crown, and they want to feel applauded and not dragged down like we’ve been politically. They want to feel proud and happy and glamorous and beautiful and free. I want to give that to them, and I hope they know that when I do this, it is for them.

A couple of weeks ago, the Times published an investigation into T.M.

It was a disturbing story that showed the ways in which racial stereotypes influence college admissions and how pervasive the idea of survivorship bias, or the tendency to focus on successful outliers, is.
The deception took a toll on the students. Casey Gerald, whose lyric memoir “There Will Be No Miracles Here” traces his journey from an underprivileged upbringing to the Ivy League, wrote about how people like him (and me, and many of my friends) who “made it” become human collateral in the myth of American meritocracy. “We ‘success stories’ are driven from elementary school on to be perfect. To ignore whatever hardships we’ve endured, whatever loneliness or pain we feel in the new worlds we’re sent off to,” he wrote. “It’s time to break the silence.”"

El Museo del Barrio Drops Plan to Honor German Socialite
By Colin Moynihan

El Museo del Barrio in Harlem, the country’s oldest museum devoted to Latino art, announced on Thursday that it was rescinding a decision to honor a princess from Germany at its upcoming 50th anniversary gala.
Longtime admirers of the museum had criticized the choice to honor Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a 58-year-old socialite who lives in a 500-room palace in Regensburg, Germany, and is known for her connections to archconservatives who complained that Pope Francis is too liberal. They include Roman Catholic officials and Stephen K. Bannon, the chief executive of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, who has forged relationships with far-right political parties in Germany and France.
Some questioned what Princess Gloria had in common with an institution that was started inside a public school classroom by a group of Puerto_Rican artists and activists.
Ana Dopico, an associate professor at New York University who studies United States Latino cultures, wrote on Twitter that it was “staggering and shocking” that El Museo would honor “a princess of Europe’s extreme right wing.”
A former El Museo board member, Alex Gonzalez, said he had asked the museum how Princess Gloria, who was reported to have once blamed the nature of Africans for spreading AIDS on that continent, “aligns with the mission and purpose of a Latinx institution” — but had not received an answer.
“Her views on the African AIDS crisis were so lacking in humanity and expressed so publicly on live TV that it should have raised a red flag,” he said on Wednesday in an email message.
After inquiries by The New York Times on Wednesday, the museum issued a statement on Thursday morning. “As a cultural institution founded on the principles of inclusion, civil rights and diversity, El Museo del Barrio is committed to honoring individuals that uphold those values and support the elevation of Latino and Latin American art and culture both in the United States and beyond,” the museum said. “As a result, El Museo del Barrio has decided to part ways with H.S.H. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis.”
Princess Gloria, reached on Thursday by email, said: “I am disappointed to what degree the society is divided today and that there seems to be absolutely no room for tolerance whatsoever. My conservative religious views have absolutely no impact on my open mind on cultural diversity and inclusion. I have been friends with all sorts of people of different political and religious views all my life.”
The criticism is the latest in a series of controversies to buffet El Museo, a respected institution that has put on well-received shows but which has also experienced serious setbacks. Financial shortfalls have forced staff cuts and reduced operating hours. Several high-profile executive departures have created a sometimes acrimonious climate.
The museum’s fourth leader in seven years, Patrick Charpenel, was named as executive director in 2017. He said that he wanted to explore subjects like immigration, exclusion and diversity, adding that museums sometimes “have to become platforms for political resistance.”
But the decision to honor Princess Gloria was a step in the opposite direction by the museum’s leadership, said Arlene Dávila, a professor and author of a forthcoming book on Latinx art (Latinx is a gender neutral alternative to Latino or Latina). “How little they know about our community,” she said. “It really is a slap in the face.”
Other honorees at the gala, which is to be held in May at the Plaza Hotel, are Raphael Montañez Ortiz, an artist and founder of El Museo; Ella Fontanals-Cisneros, an art collector and philanthropist who created the nonprofit Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation; and Craig Robins, a collector and real estate developer who is a trustee of the Pérez Art Museum in Miami.
For many years, Princess Gloria was a hard partying art-collecting aristocrat who was sometimes known as “Princess TNT.” Nowadays she is a practicing Catholic whose intimates include several figures who vigorously oppose the current Pope.
She has said that Cardinal Raymond Burke, the American leader of the anti-Francis faction, is as close to her as a family priest. She introduced Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German Cardinal who was fired by Francis from his position as the church’s top doctrinal watchdog, to Mr. Bannon.
Mr. Bannon, who met last year with leaders of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party and addressed France’s far right National Front, aims to build a “gladiator school” for the training of Catholics hostile to Francis.
Princess Gloria was reported to have told a German television host in 2001 that Africa had a high incidence of AIDS because “blacks like to copulate a lot.” She later sought to amend that, saying the reason for that was the continent’s intense heat.
Some people who criticized El Museo said that the decision to honor Princess Gloria was part of a series of moves that have distanced the museum from its roots.
The museum was founded in 1969, during a time of political upheaval, to emphasize Puerto_Rican cultural contributions. But it eventually embraced a broader mission to exhibit the work of Latino, Caribbean and Latin American artists from all backgrounds.
“El Museo was founded by New York Puerto_Rican activists, educators and artists whose community had been excluded from elite institutions,” Ms. Dopico wrote in an email message. “What values does the Museum honor in honoring Von Thurn und Taxis? How is this honor connected to el Museo’s past or its future?”"

Do We Need Another ‘Ugly’ Betty?
By Concepción de León

In the 1999 Colombian telenovela “Yo Soy Betty, la Fea,” viewers were introduced to the character of Beatriz “Betty” Pinzón Solano: a brilliant, accomplished woman in her mid-20s who is held back professionally because of her looks. Betty, played by the actress Ana María Orozco, had a unibrow, braces and blunt bangs. She wore oversized red framed glasses and unflattering clothes, and her voice was raspy in a swallowed-a-frog kind of way. In the telenovela, Betty struggles to find employment, despite her graduate degree in economics, so she ends up accepting a position as a secretary at a fashion company. There, she falls in love with her handsome boss, Armando, who, despite his initial revulsion, falls for her too.
Betty’s story struck a chord with viewers, in Colombia and elsewhere. “Betty, la Fea” has spawned remakes all over the world: In Mexico, there was “La Fea Más Bella,” starring Angélica Vale. In the United States, America Ferrera won an Emmy for her starring role in “Ugly Betty,” which ran on ABC for four seasons. Production companies in Spain, Greece, the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand have all released their own versions. And last week, Telemundo premiered its own reboot, “Betty en NY.”
I’m a huge fan of the original. So huge that I refused to watch “Ugly Betty” when it aired on ABC. It could never match up, I thought. Betty was different from other female novela protagonists of the ’90s and early aughts, because she was distinguished by her intellect rather than her looks. And despite the social barriers she faced as a result of others’ superficiality, she never felt bad for herself. Instead, she and her friend Nicolás Mora even made light of their circumstances. In the very first episode of the Colombian original, Nicolás, joking about the challenges of finding a job, says they should try out for the circus. Betty, in a fit of laughter, adds that they could be hired to scare the lions into behaving.
It reads harshly, I know, but I see it instead as radical acceptance. Betty and Nicolás acknowledge the reality of the society they live in, where résumés need to be accompanied by photographs. It’s true in real life, too, that appearance is heavily scrutinized, even if it is unspoken.
Recently, I gave in and watched Ferrera’s “Ugly Betty.” I was surprised to find that the story translated well. Like the original, this Betty does not lament her looks, and the story is pushed forward to be about existing in two different worlds. Betty is a Latina who lives in Queens with her family and finds it hard to fit in at her job in Manhattan at the fashion magazine, Mode. Ferrera’s Betty is funny and resilient; she doesn’t back down when others try to make her feel less than.
I expected a similarly modern approach from “Betty en NY,” which seems, so far, to be staying close to the Colombian original, with some minor updates: a reggaeton-version of the original theme song, a character who is a social media maven and another who is queer. Some of the scenes are close to identical, and many of the characters look like those in the Colombian version.
But because the show is meant to take place today, I felt more critical of the changes in society it isn’t accounting for. The #MeToo movement has resulted in increased scrutiny of the treatment of women in the workplace, and anti-bullying campaigns have received increased public attention over the last few years. The treatment of Betty in the new remake borders on cruel, and it is grating to watch. There is one scene in which the hiring manager tells Armando that he refused Betty the job because of her looks. “I can’t believe that the director of human resources of my company is saying this nonsense,” responds Armando. But he quickly follows up with, “How ugly can she be?”
“Betty en NY” was smart to take the word “ugly” out of its title, because women shouldn’t have to contend with it, in their professional lives or elsewhere. Both Ferrera and Orozco’s Bettys were defined by more than their appearance. As “Betty en NY” progresses, I hope Telemundo’s new Betty develops a similar complexity.

How to Discuss Your Mental Health With Family Members Who Don’t Get It
By Concepción de León

Let me know if any of these sound familiar: Boys don’t cry. We don’t air family business. You have to be strong. Turn to God.
These refrains (all of which I’ve heard at least once, some in the last month) are just some of the responses that people dealing with mental health challenges in Latino communities have come to know well. Going to therapy or struggling with mental illness can be viewed as a sign of weakness or that you’re “crazy.” Combine this with unequal access to mental health services and quality health insurance, and it’s no wonder that Latinos, who are just as likely to suffer from a mental illness as whites, are half as likely to seek treatment.
When Adriana Alejandre, a therapist in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, started her practice in 2017, she tried to find accessible information for her predominantly Latino patients — the kind of resources that would apply directly to their lives. “I was super frustrated, because I couldn’t find any resources for my clients that were relevant, that were modern, that weren’t so much clinical jargon,” she said.
So last year, she started a podcast to get the word out and help Latino patients see therapists as “more relatable.” Immediately she received dozens of responses asking for more information and, crucially, Spanish-language content. Alejandre started recording the episodes in Spanish as well as English. Now, Latinx Therapy is a full-fledged platform with a directory of therapists and free screening tests for depression, eating disorders and other common mental illnesses.
At speaking engagements, Alejandre said, people still tell her things like “I’m not crazy,” or “That stuff is not for us, for our family. Our problems, we solve it ourselves.” She explained that Latino communities tend to be collectivist, meaning that we value the group over the individual, sometimes to personal detriment. In other words, if family members are resistant to therapy or talking about mental health struggles, “breaking that is tough,” Alejandre said. “The downfall is that people suffer in silence.”
The mental health activist Dior Vargas, 31, was one of those people. “I didn’t talk about it with my family at all,” she said about her early struggles with anxiety and depression. “Everything really came to a head when I attempted to end my life when I was 18. That was an eye-opening experience for my family.”
“We were all thrust into this really traumatic experience,” she added. Her family “went from having no knowledge to having a lot of knowledge.”
One of the problems was that Vargas struggled with viewing her own experiences as valid. She grew up hearing about how many family members grew up poor in Ecuador, including her grandfather, who emigrated to the United States with only a third grade education.
“There’s so much trauma he went through that he didn’t deal with, that he didn’t talk about,” she said. Hearing about her grandfather’s struggles made her think: “Who am I to talk about feeling depressed? Ain’t nobody got time for that.”
But intergenerational trauma is a crucial reason for Latinos to go to therapy, said Alejandre. Not doing so “allows the cycle to continue — whether it’s trauma, whether it’s depression, anxiety, domestic violence,” she said.
She suggests explaining therapy to family members by comparing it to other common treatments: “When we have a cough, we take cough syrup, jarabe, to feel better. When our minds are sick, we go to therapy.” She also said it’s important to clarify that therapy is not only for moments of crisis. “Therapy is a space where you can learn to build skills, whether that’s communication, whether that’s understanding yourself, creating boundaries.”
For me, setting boundaries meant not telling anyone in my family that I was going to therapy for more than a year. It helped to have it be my own thing, to not have to answer to anyone or be questioned about what went on there. Vargas’s approach was to share “very general things so that they felt like they were part of it, but not to the extent that they knew too much, because that time between me and my therapist was my time.”
Alejandre said: “It is tough when family sees you as ungrateful for healthy behaviors like boundary setting. But the system will not change if someone does not initiate the change.”
And early conversations about therapy are like planting seeds in our communities, she added. Those seeds will grow into an understanding “whenever they’re ready.”"

El Museo del Barrio Appoints Chief Curator
By Sara Aridi

El Museo del Barrio has appointed Rodrigo Moura, formerly the adjunct curator of Brazilian art at the São Paulo Museum of Art, as its chief curator.
Patrick Charpenel, the executive director of the museum, said Mr. Moura’s community-driven, socially-oriented vision “totally aligns” with El Museo’s values and mission.
An institution like El Museo “obviously is very sensitive about diversity, very sensitive about immigration, very sensitive about marginality,” Mr. Charpenel said. He added that those issues are at the heart of Mr. Moura’s work.
Before his time at the São Paulo Museum of Art, Mr. Moura spent 12 years at the Inhotim Institute, an outdoor contemporary art museum in central Brazil, where he served as curator and artistic director. He joins El Museo as it works to restructure and expand its curatorial staff after facing several setbacks.
Years ago, the department consisted of nearly 10 employees, Mr. Charpenel said. But after financial problems forced staff cuts and reduced operating hours, that number dwindled to one.
When Mr. Charpenel was hired in late 2017, he had become El Museo’s fourth leader in seven years. And he was tasked with maintaining the museum’s relevance during a 10-month renovation that wrapped up last September.
In addition to multiple personnel changes, El Museo has faced somewhat of an identity crisis. The museum was founded in 1969 by a group of Puerto_Rican educators, artists and activists in East Harlem. After relocating to its current space on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street in 1977, the question arose: Should El Museo remain a community-based institution for the Barrio or should it broaden its reach to represent Latino and Latin-American art?
“I think it has to reflect, in a very large and diverse way, the connections with the different Latinx communities, the connection with the Puerto_Rican community and the connection also with Latin America,” Mr. Charpenel said. (Latinx is a gender neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.)
That’s why, he added, “we’re in the process of restructuring and growing.”"

Waiting for a Bus? Time to Enjoy a Taste of Art
By Sophie Haigney

This summer, 100 city bus shelters will be transformed into platforms for an exhibition of work by a New York-based photographer, Elle Pérez.
Pérez’s “from sun to sun,” which opens on Aug. 13, is the first exhibition in a collaboration between the nonprofit Public Art Fund and the advertising firm JCDecaux, which controls the ad space for about 3,400 bus shelters in New York City. The Public Art Fund will use this unconventional canvas to present two solo photography exhibitions annually; each exhibition will run for 14 weeks on 100 bus shelters.
Mx. Pérez, 29, has been photographing New York, and especially the Bronx, for years. Past work by Mx. Pérez, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns “they” and “them,” has explored the punk community in the Bronx, underground night life culture, gender identity and Latinx communities. (Latinx is a gender neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.) For “from sun to sun,” Mx. Pérez will shoot new work all over the city — mostly focused on portraiture, but also on revisiting locations that have personal significance.
“I grew up all over the city,” Mx. Pérez said, recalling long rides on the No. 6 train from Lower Manhattan to the Bronx, “certain spots in Harlem” and the Puerto_Rican neighborhood in Bushwick where they now live. “I’ve been hanging out in bus stops for research,” they said.
Katerina Stathopoulou, assistant curator at the Public Art Fund, said the broad reach of the exhibition was part of the goal. “We really want to reach all five boroughs,” she said.
Ms. Stathopoulou said there are visual advantages to bus shelters-as-exhibition-spaces. “The work will be at street level, and at eye level,” she said. “When you look at something in a bus shelter, it’s often at life scale. Especially because in the first iterations of the series we’re primarily focusing on portraiture, to be able to look at a full-sized portrait eye-to-eye will be a really powerful experience.”
Mx. Pérez is also excited about the bus stop as a platform. “What’s really exciting to me about this project is the potential for having something on the street available and accessible to the people I grew up with and grew up around,” they said, noting that people might have extra time at bus stops. “When someone is sitting on a bench on the way to work, knowing the bus is coming, they may have to wait a long time,” Mx. Pérez said. “That may be time that they don’t actually spend with one image in museums and galleries, but while they’re waiting for the bus, they can.”"

A Lost Latino Hotspot Is Reborn on a Chicago Stage
By Kris Vire

At the intersection of Belmont and Sheffield Avenues in the Lakeview neighborhood here, a few blocks south of Wrigley Field, once stood a Latin supper club known as La Havana Madrid. A social hub for Spanish-speaking immigrants — many from Cuba, Puerto_Rico and Colombia — the club played host to some of the most famous musical acts of the Latin big-band and salsa eras, as well as local favorites.
“Cheo Feliciano, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Fania All-Stars,” recalled Myrna Salazar, who began visiting the club as a teenager in the 1960s. “The big-name recording artists, they all went to La Havana Madrid.”
The building that housed the club still stands, butting up against the southbound tracks of the Belmont L station. But you won’t find any trace of La Havana Madrid there; the second floor, which housed the club, is now divided into a punky hair salon and a women’s fitness studio.
“It’s like everything — gentrification,” Ms. Salazar said. “History is lost. The leadership moves or dies, and we don’t have records of those things.”
Ms. Salazar spent nearly a quarter of a century as a talent agent before retiring in 2006. She’s now the executive director and primary force behind the Chicago Latino Theater Alliance, which organizes Destinos, an international Latino theater festival that will stage its third edition this fall.
She has also become a character in the play “La Havana Madrid,” inspired by the forgotten nightclub, which begins performances at the Den Theater here on May 11. The production is reopening two years after the Latino-focused company Teatro Vista first staged it in an 80-seat space at Steppenwolf Theater Company.
The play is the brainchild of Sandra Delgado, a Chicago native and longtime stage actor with extensive credits at Steppenwolf and other important local theaters. (New York audiences may have seen her at the Public Theater in 2017 as Jocasta in Luis Alfaro’s “Oedipus El Rey.”)
“La Havana Madrid” began its life as a piece about her parents, who came here from Colombia in the mid-1960s. Then she heard her father talk about the Lakeview club where they spent many nights out dancing.
“It was this immediate moment of like, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s not the play. This is the play,’” she said. “What was this place?”
Despite having grown up less than a mile west of where the club had been, Ms. Delgado said, she had never heard of it before then. And in the earliest stages of her research, she found herself frustrated, “going to libraries, going online and finding absolutely nothing.”
If you search the Chicago Tribune archive for coverage of La Havana Madrid, all you’ll find are classified ads for cocktail waitresses and one passing mention in a story on police cracking down on a numbers game. Nothing on its programming.
“It really just speaks to the larger issue,” Ms. Delgado said. “Where do Latinx people” — people of Latin American heritage — “fit in the history of this country? Especially in this city that’s so black and white.”
Further research did lead her to learn about the city’s first Puerto_Rican Day Parade, in 1966: “I’m reading something online, and it says, ‘The queen of the first Puertorriqueños parade, Myrna Salazar.’ I’m like, Myrna? She was my first talent agent! Any Latinx actor who’s been around since the ’90s, that’s who represented us.”
Ms. Delgado called Ms. Salazar to ask if she had any information to share about La Havana Madrid. The details flooded out. The club was where Ms. Salazar had her bachelorette party. Its owner was the best man at her wedding to her now ex-husband.
“Yes,” Ms. Salazar recalled telling her, “I can give you some history.”
Ms. Salazar put Ms. Delgado in touch with the best man, Tony Quintana, who had been La Havana Madrid’s second owner, in the latter half of the 1960s. She found more former patrons through social media and other connections.
Many of their stories, including those of Ms. Delgado’s parents, are told in “La Havana Madrid,” a loose series of vignettes delivered to audience members who sit (and can drink) at cabaret tables. Under the direction of Cheryl Lynn Bruce, it was named one of Time Out Chicago’s Top 10 plays of 2017.
The leader of the onstage band, Carpacho y Su Súper Combo, is Roberto “Carpacho” Marin, who has been friends with Ms. Delgado’s father dating back to Medellín, Colombia; his story, of coming to America on a musician’s visa and deciding to stay, undocumented, when he was offered a steady gig, is included, too.
A preview feature in the Chicago Sun-Times led to Ms. Delgado receiving a Facebook message from the daughter of the club’s original owner, a Cuban baseball player named Luis “Witto” Aloma, who had retired in Chicago after playing for the White Sox in the early 1950s.
“She’s telling me how the dinner menu was half-Cuban, half-Spanish, about the beautiful china that had green edging with gold flecks,” Ms. Delgado said. “We’re already in rehearsal, and all of a sudden I have these really concrete details — what the steps looked like, what the room looked like.”
Carlos Flores, an amateur historian of Puerto_Rican Chicago and a longtime street photographer, provided many of the images that illustrate the show in projections.
“La Havana Madrid” sold out its initial six-week run at Steppenwolf. The Goodman, finding itself with an empty studio space when the actor Stacy Keach’s illness forced the postponement of his solo show, offered to bring the show downtown.
Reconfigured for a space with more than twice as many seats, it sold out another month, finding repeat customers and even former Chicagoans returning for a taste of their past.
“Someone my age would come once, and then they would come back with their parents, and then they would come back with their kids,” Ms. Delgado said.
She hopes “La Havana Madrid” can recapture that energy for another six weeks at the Den — then, perhaps, beyond.
“I think specifically about New York, because it’s super Puerto_Rican, very Colombian,” Ms. Delgado said. “There’s a very strong Caribbean Latinx presence there. I think it would resonate.”"

Frieze New York Addresses the Heat and Expands the Kitchen
By Ted Loos

Frieze New York, the eighth edition of which takes place Thursday through Sunday in Randalls Island Park, has distinguished itself as a thoughtful entry in the global art fair derby, offering copious curated sections and special projects in addition to serving as a commercial hub.
But the lesson learned from the 2018 New York fair is that the practical details of putting on an event are tricky and must be attended to.
Last May, an unexpected heat wave sent temperatures in the Frieze tents soaring to uncomfortable levels, and organizers were unprepared for it.
Art world denizens — never known for being stoic — made it clear that a repeat would not be welcome.
“The climate issues really posed a problem,” said Jane Cohan of James Cohan Gallery, who exhibited last year.
For this year’s fair, featuring about 191 dealers, an engineering consultant was hired to ensure temperate conditions. Victoria Siddall, the director of Frieze Fairs, said that all the 2018 participants had been offered a partial rebate on their booth fees. (Frieze puts on two fairs in London each fall, and the Los Angeles iteration had its debut in February.)
Dealers like Ms. Cohan were confident enough that the issue wouldn’t pose a problem again that she and her gallery have returned with not one but two booths this time.
“We do really well there,” said Ms. Cohan, who has two spaces in New York already and is effectively tripling down on her local presence by participating in the fair. “We can’t give it up.”
Having addressed the heat, Loring Randolph, the artistic director of Frieze Americas, is hoping that the galleries on hand will generate buzz among collectors. The sheer variety of offerings helps.
Asian dealer participation is up this year, with new additions from Taipei, Taiwan; Kolkata, India; and Seoul, South Korea. The number of Chinese galleries has increased to six this year from two last year with the addition of Tang Contemporary Art, MadeIn Gallery, Capsule Shanghai and Edouard Malingue Gallery.
“We’re always looking to make the fair more international,” Ms. Siddall said.
In the main galleries section, dual presentations are a popular option for the global powerhouse dealers.
Lisson Gallery (with branches in London, New York and Shanghai) will present the work of Leon Polk Smith alongside works by the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes that were created for the occasion. David Zwirner (with three branches in New York, as well as outposts in London and Hong Kong) will feature pieces by the artists Harold Ancart and Christopher Williams, also crafted for the fair.
Gagosian, with no less than 16 branches worldwide, continues the twinning trend by showing works by the sculptor John Chamberlain and the painter Steven Parrino.
By design, the curator-guided sections of the fair are likely to garner a lot of attention from visitors.
“We have more curated content than ever this year,” Ms. Randolph said.
She noted the start of a new public art initiative, Frieze Sculpture, which opened last weekend at Rockefeller Center; an homage to the pioneering 1970s and ’80s nonprofit arts center Just Above Midtown; and even an exhibition of virtual reality art.
The biggest curated section, Spotlight, is focused on overlooked 20th-century artists, and it was organized by Laura Hoptman, the director of the Drawing Center in New York. Thirty-three galleries will present solo booths, and the section has its own tent, one of four that make up the fair.
“Frieze New York has always differentiated itself by doing great solo booths,” Ms. Randolph said.
Though some of the artists in Spotlight worked in places far from Randalls Island, many of them were New Yorkers, including Louise Fishman, Mary Ann Unger, Knox Martin and Charles Hinman.
“It will broaden our ideas of what was going on in our own town,” Ms. Hoptman said. “It immerses the public in a series of stories they may not have known before.”
Prajit Dutta, a partner in New York’s Aicon Gallery, is showing the Algerian-born Rachid Koraichi as part of Spotlight. Discovering Mr. Koraichi’s work was love at first sight, he said, but it took a while to develop a business relationship.
“I first saw him at 2006 in a MoMA show,” Mr. Dutta said. “It was a discovery for me.”
Mr. Koraichi uses Arabic semiotics and calligraphy as the basis of his work, and the booth will feature engravings, banners, tapestries and a sculpture.
“He works with a rich context and background of ancient art, but he puts it into a clean, sharp, modern setting,” Mr. Dutta said. “It’s a marvelous combination.”
And Mr. Dutta sees another advantage in showing Mr. Koraichi’s art.
“Frieze is a tough market to penetrate,” he said of the battle for attention amid thousands of artworks. “But no one else is going to be showing anything remotely like this.”
Diálogos, a new section focused on Latino and Latinx art, will help mark the 50th anniversary of El Museo del Barrio, the institution in East Harlem. It was organized by El Museo’s director, Patrick Charpenel, and one of its curators, Susanna V. Temkin.
Mr. Charpenel was blunt about the necessity of Diálogos. “Latinx and Latin American representation is always really low at art fairs,” he said. “This gives us visibility.”
The prominence of the presentations, including the artists Marta Chilindron, Ana Mendieta and Freddy Rodríguez, is part of the “decolonization of culture,” Ms. Temkin said.
“I’m really excited about the Freddy Rodríguez work,” she added, noting that the painter is a New Yorker of Dominican descent. “Sometimes acclaim for Latin American artists is easier than for the Latinx, who don’t always fit into geographical categories.”
James Cohan Gallery and the dealer Kavi Gupta of Chicago are presenting Firelei Báez, a Bronx-based artist who does everything from painting to making immersive installations.
The works will probably benefit from being in Frieze’s light-filled tents, regardless of the weather outside — or inside, for that matter.
Ms. Randolph said that based on last year’s heat wave, she had one request having nothing to do with art: “I hope it’s going to snow.”"

‘Vida’: Tanya Saracho on Colorism and the ‘Authenticity Police’
By Vanessa Erazo

Starz’s splashy half-hour drama “Vida” begins with two Mexican-American sisters, Lyn (Melissa Barrera) and Emma (Mishel Prada) Hernandez, returning home to a gentrifying Eastside Los Angeles after the death of their mother. While dealing with their loss and the reality of the large debt their mother left behind, they encounter homophobia, wrestle with sexual identity and wade through the heavy emotional baggage that comes with complicated family relationships. And then there’s the secret wife their mom never told them about.
In its short six-episode first season, “Vida” deftly covered a lot of ground — the show is an intimate look at the experiences of the grandchildren of immigrants and the struggle to balance being both Mexican and American. Season 2, premiering Thursday, delves even deeper into the sisters' performative bicultural identity.
Tanya Saracho, the showrunner, said most of the writers — herself included — have encountered what she’s dubbed the “authenticity police.”
“You’re not brown enough, you’re not light enough, you’re not Mexican enough. Your Spanish is not good enough,” she explained.
On the flip side, “We are steeped in the dominant culture. It reminds us of our otherness every day.”
In a recent phone interview, Saracho discussed being a first-time showrunner, tackling colorism in the new episodes and making her television directing debut. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.
During Season 1, you posted on social media about the uneasiness you felt being a new showrunner. Did you have mentors for that process?
I didn’t have mentors, but I did have people who held my hand. There were technical things, like — what kind of camera [to use]? Those kinds of things that I didn’t know about, I felt that it was O.K. to ask. Even though I’d done a showrunner training program and learned about budgets from John Wells in a one-day workshop, that’s not enough [time]. Everybody around me was a woman and maybe there’s something to that, that I didn’t feel dumb asking my producer Robin Schwartz, “What does that mean?” or “How do we hire a line producer?”
[Starz] said, “Show us what you want it to look like.” I made a whole presentation, but mostly I said, “I want it to feel this way.” Some people, because they’ve been around cameras a long time, they know shorthand they can say on set. I don’t have training in this. Theater is my training.
They did give me a pilot presentation where it felt like a great crash course for showrunning because we had to do everything from top to bottom, hire all the same positions. Aesthetically, it was a time where I could learn to communicate with a director. Because I had a specific way I wanted it to look.
What motivated those choices you made for the visual style?
I wanted it to feel [insidery]. A lot of times when we watch our communities represented on the screen, it feels like a museum piece. Like we’re coming to watch a safari. But that’s an outsider’s point of view.
Also our skin color — I find that TV whitewashes our different shades; they wash the diaspora out of us. Latinx [a gender-neutral term for Latinos] — we are all subtones and undertones, and they just wash it out with a blue, or something bright. Or they brownface us even more. They just saturate us. I wanted it to look like us, but also to give it that prestige of an indie film.
This season, you directed an episode for the first time. Why did you pick the finale?
At the end of the last season, Marta Fernandez, my executive at Starz was like, “You should direct next season.” I was like, “Yeah, I do want to direct like fourth or fifth season.” She was like, “No, just direct next season. You’ll be fine. You will have support.”
When we came to set up the season, the one that made the most sense to direct, so that I could finish my showrunning duties, was the last one. But I was just as scared because I was like, “Hold on, that’s the finale. I don’t want my finale to suck.”
It was like this looming thing at the end. It was a source of anxiety, but then it was the best experience. I’ve directed 16 plays in the theater. And I forgot, “Oh, that’s right. I’ve directed actors. I’ve done that part.” My favorite part was sitting and editing my own stuff. All the stuff I was scared about, like not knowing [camera] angles, running out of time for a scene — none of that happened. So I’ve got the bug now. I want to do it again and again. Only for my shows — I don’t want to mess up somebody else’s show — and maybe a movie. Now the possibilities are endless, and I have to thank Marta for making me do it.
Can you talk about the Spanglish that’s used on the show?
There are opinions on the type of Spanglish we use. It’s so complicated because it’s a made-up way of communicating and there’s not one uniform way. There’s no dictionary that you could look at. It’s how we communicate and if you hear us, the writers, like in our texts — the California Spanglish is just very different from the Tex-Mex stuff. Also, it’s generational.
But every character has had a cadence and a rhythm since the beginning. Eddy has a different kind of Spanglish than Mari; Eddy’s older. Eddy still says “carnal,” “firme” — words that Mari should not say.
And with marketing, too. The fact that we get the words desmadre and chingona on the key art and teaser art, to me it’s radical. It’s revolutionary because not even every Latino is going to know what desmadre is — it's something like a “hot mess.” Mexicans and Mexican-Americans haven’t gotten a chance to see themselves like that in key art.
On Latino TV shows, we rarely see Afro-Latinos. Is that something you thought about in regards to casting?
Not for this show. I’ve been very aware of this and I’m in full agreement with you. My next show I’m developing is called “Brujas” and it’s all Afro-Latinx leads. I just had a mini writers’ room for [the pilot] and it was all Afro-Latinx writers.
In the “Brujas” writers’ room, we talked about how proximity to whiteness becomes the goal. Our culture’s colonized. All of us.
Have you heard of the notion of “hay que mejorar la raza,” meaning “You have to better the race”? A lot of Afro-Latinx suffer from their mothers or fathers saying, “Marry lighter, marry white so we can better the race.” We have that in us, in our culture.
In this season of “Vida” I wanted to touch on the notion of being prieto, and how colorism is alive and well in the Latinx community. All that is our shame, our stuff that we haven’t aired out that much. And I love when we get to air it out."

Gay, Cuban and in Love
By Isvett Verde

On April 20, 1980, Fidel Castro, then the president of Cuba, proclaimed that any citizen who wanted to leave the island could depart from the nearby port of Mariel. In the six months that followed, nearly 125,000 Cubans journeyed across the Straits of Florida, including thousands of queer men and women fleeing persecution. Casimiro González and Manuel Rodríguez were among them.
Theirs is one of the many stories highlighted in Queer Miami: A History of L.G.B.T.Q Communities, a new exhibition at the HistoryMiami Museum tied to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion. Using archival footage, photographs and memorabilia, the curator Julio Capó Jr., an associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, traces Miami’s L.G.B.T.Q history (and struggles) from 1890 to the present, including how the city was shaped by Cuban immigrants.
The Mariel boatlift was, among other things, a “homophobic purge,” said Dr. Capó Jr. “Fidel Castro claimed that those who wanted to leave were the dregs of society who could never be productive to the Cuban revolution,” he added.
Mr. González and Mr. Rodríguez met in a movie theater in Havana when they were in their 20s. They arrived in the United States in 1980, and, after nearly half a century together, they married in 2015. When I spoke to them over the phone, they alternated between finishing each other’s sentences and cracking jokes at the other’s expense. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What was the Cuban government’s attitude toward gay people in the ’70s?
GONZÁLEZ: It wasn’t safe for us. Police officers would often raid movie theaters. The lights would come on, and they’d round up anyone they didn’t like the look of into buses, and haul them off to jail. They’d do that at cabarets, too.
RODRÍGUEZ: When Fidel Castro said people could leave, I went to the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, and told them I stole clotheslines, that I was a homosexual and was against the revolution. I really piled it on. Afterward I hid in my house for two days, afraid to even come near the window, while I waited for my exit permit. Mobs would throw eggs or worse at people like us. Casimiro would walk to my house to see me. On the third day a police officer in a motorcycle came by and called out my name, signaling that it was time for me to go. My mother had made me a steak sandwich, but I could barely get it down.
GONZÁLEZ: Enough talk about steak sandwiches, you’re making me hungry!
RODRÍGUEZ: It was almost 7 p.m. when I left Cuba on May 15, 1980. They piled 289 of us on a little shrimp boat. All but around 17 of us were prisoners the government had forced the boat owner to take with him. There was no space to sit or even puke if you got seasick.
GONZÁLEZ: After he left I stayed in bed, chain-smoked and drank coffee. I couldn’t eat anything. I finally got my exit permit 11 days later. Our boat ran out of gas and we drifted. Eventually we were rescued by an American military ship, a battleship. These doors opened up, and I was sure cannons would come out of them. Incredibly our boat went inside the belly of the ship. I thought, “This is the end! They’re going to make picadillo out of us and throw us back in the water!” But the Americans were nice to us. They gave us something to eat, and then I had the luxury of arriving in Miami in a helicopter.
RODRÍGUEZ: Llegó en estilo, but he didn’t have a penny in his pocket.
When you arrived, the United States was on the precipice of the AIDS crisis, and homophobia was rampant, yet you were free from the neighborhood watches back home. What was that like for you?
RODRÍGUEZ: I remember how free I felt. The first time we went dancing, we stood with our mouths agape. Men were dancing with men, women with women. We began adapting to all these things, which were new to us. Though back then the Latino community criticized people like us, so we were still very private. None of my co-workers ever knew.
GONZÁLEZ: He told them he was married in Cuba and that he left 40 kids behind! Things have changed so much since then. We lost so many friends to AIDS.
In the days before FaceTime and email, leaving home felt more permanent. Did you ever doubt your decision to leave? At this point you’ve lived in the United States longer than you did Cuba — do you feel American?
GONZÁLEZ: I didn’t know what would happen to us once we got here. I was scared. Then when we established ourselves, nostalgia set in. You longed for family, for Cuban things.
RODRÍGUEZ: Now I consider myself an American. This was the country I was destined to live in.
GONZÁLEZ: Yeah. You never forget your roots, but I feel American.

‘Pose’ Star Mj Rodriguez ‘Had to Teach Simply by Existing’
By Isabelia Herrera

In the world of “Pose,” the FX show that depicts the ascent of ballroom culture during the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic in late ’80s and early ’90s New York City, Mj Rodriguez is Blanca, the no-nonsense mother of the House of Evangelista who pushes her L.G.B.T.Q. children to surmount difficult but formative obstacles. The role is a full-circle moment for Rodriguez, who found her own chosen family when she was 14 and joined a ballroom house that became a haven for her as a queer teenager.
“I was always the kid who was very well aware of who I was,” Rodriguez said. But the ballroom community allowed her to grow into herself without people “policing me on how I acted or how I existed in the world.”
“Pose” made history when it announced its cast, which has the largest ensemble of trans actors ever to appear on a scripted television show as series regulars. The show’s creators — Ryan Murphy, Steven Canals, and Brad Falchuk — also recruited real-life legends to contribute to the show. These included the choreographer José Gutierrez-Xtravaganza, a ballroom luminary who was featured in the influential documentary “Paris Is Burning” and toured with Madonna after she released “Vogue.” Xtravaganza serves as a consultant on “Pose” and even appears in several episodes.
Rodriguez’s character arc has depicted many of the hardships of transgender people growing up in that era, most of which persist today, making the show feel profoundly relevant. In the first season, viewers learned that Blanca’s family had struggled to accept her after she decided to transition, a trauma that left her with scars still left to heal and that influences her tough-love approach. The second season of “Pose” unravels even more of Blanca’s journey — a major plotline involving a racist landlord evinces the long history of rental discrimination against trans women of color.
With the season finale of “Pose” approaching on Aug. 20, I sat down with Rodriguez to discuss the show, her personal growth and her views on queerness in Latinx communities. This article contains spoilers for season two of “Pose.”
This conversation has been edited and condensed.
I wanted to talk to you about how the ballroom community paved the way for your interest in acting and your personal journey. What do you think the ballroom community gave you?
Ballroom culture never really influenced my acting career. I always had that push from my mother and my father, and also just me being someone who loved it from birth. But the ballroom community did contribute to my dancing and to me being more comfortable in my body, moving and not being afraid to be judged. It helped me with my confidence as far as living in a world where — well, at that time — a lot of people weren’t as understanding or as accepting of people in the ballroom community, which was mainly made up of African-American gay men, Latino gay men and Latina and black trans women. And obviously African-American and Latina lesbians. If I hadn’t had that scene, I would never have been the person I am today.
In this last season, we really dive more into Blanca’s story. There’s the whole story line about how she was discriminated against by a white landlord named Frederica Norman for being a black Dominican trans woman. What do you think that story line tells us?
One, Patti LuPone, who plays Frederica, is extremely different from her character. Patti LuPone is an amazing actress. It’s kind of epic [laughs]. We’ve grown really close to each other.
But I think it’s great representation on FX’s end, because they’re showing what a lot of people of color, especially black people and, obviously, Latinx people, go through when it comes to not only their skin, but their cultural background. I’m glad that they showed that. It’s something that the world needs to see. As we all know, Blanca is multifaceted. She has five dimensions to her, versus one dimension. She’s a human. And I think that story line is just a representation of what goes on with people who are misinformed.
In the first season, there’s an episode in which Blanca has to reconnect with her conservative family. Among Latinos, we often have a difficult time accepting our L.G.B.T.Q. family members. What do you make of telling that story about the Latino community’s attitude toward queerness?
Not every parent gets a handbook when they’re raising their child. There were moments in my life where I had to teach simply by existing. That’s what Blanca did, as many Latina and black trans women do.
As far as the Latinx community, there is a lot we need to work on. There’s still a lot of aggression when it comes to men in the Latino community, because they don’t understand. Our exterior has evolved in ways that they never imagined, because they were raised in a different generation. We have to constantly teach them that the core of who we are is still the same and pass down that lesson to generations that come after us.
I feel like depicting trans experiences can be a lot of responsibility. What has it been like navigating that?
The responsibility has been quite easy. I’ve always led my life by simply existing and walking in my truth. I’ve made sure that I did a lot of work on me to know that I didn’t have to worry about anyone else’s thought process. Whether it be bigotry toward me or whether it be a derogatory slur toward me, I made sure that I worked hard on not worrying about those things.
And now that “Pose” has come into play, all I do is just live and tell the stories. “Pose” has put a lot of trans women of color on the map, and shown that we have much more to our lives than just the stigma. It shows that we have chapters to our lives. We’ve always known this about ourselves, but a lot of people haven’t. To be quite honest, I think it’s the people’s responsibility to really dive into our lives, the ones who don’t understand, who have probably never seen a trans woman. It’s their responsibility to learn and do the work. It’s also our responsibility to say, “Yes, that’s right,” or “No, let me help you with that.” It’s teamwork, not just one person doing it.
What has it been like working with so many legends from the ballroom scene?
It’s been an honor sitting in front of people who have paved the way for me. Hector Xtravaganza — God rest his soul — he was the one who cultivated a lot of things when it came to walking runway and fashion. Willi Ninja as well.
José Xtravaganza was the one who actually choreographed that whole dance sequence in the first episode of the second season. We all sat there and watched him. There were no words. There was just dancing and movement and vogue. It was beautiful. It was an homage to him, but not only was a light shed on him, he also became a beacon, a pillar for the people who have seen him in the years since.
These were people who were in Madonna’s “Vogue.” These were people who were choreographing for artists, and they’re actually getting their due being seen on a television show like “Pose.”
This year marks 50 years since the Stonewall uprising. Looking forward, what hopes do you have for the Latinx L.G.B.T.Q. community in the future? What would you like to see more of?
I would like to see more representation of Latinx L.G.B.T.Q. figures. There’s not enough. I feel like there’s a part of the industry that needs to shed a bit more light on us. Hopefully that’ll lead to a better understanding of us as human beings, and open minds up to actually focus on bigger things, like fixing this world that we’re living in.

The Trump Campaign Knows Why Obama Won. Do Democrats?
By Joy Cushman

Before Republicans send their organizers into early primary states, the organizers reportedly must read and pass a test on “Groundbreakers,” the story of how Barack Obama revolutionized campaigning by putting his faith in hundreds of thousands of volunteers.
I was a top organizer in his 2008 campaign and trained thousands of the campaign’s staff members. The book’s authors and I fear that the wealthy elites on the left have less respect than ever before for the strategies that got Mr. Obama elected. If Democrats want to win in 2020, they must get back to investing in the power of everyday people through organizing.
Republicans know how President Obama won, yet there is a contentious debate among progressives about how to run campaigns. One side says you engage your most excited supporters, organizing them into local leadership teams and helping them host trainings, house parties and voter registration drives so that they can build support and gather accurate data about their neighborhoods.
This creates the capacity for millions of authentic, person-to-person conversations about families’ experiences, and their hopes and fears — the kinds of conversations that can expand an electorate, energize a base and demobilize the opposition. Data and technology are tools to improve this work, not the machinery for controlling people.
The other side, louder and better funded, says that data, technology and analytics should drive campaign strategies and voter outreach programs. So campaigns hire tech companies to create lists of potential supporters based on algorithms and statistical modeling. And they develop apps through which supporters are meant to blast, but not actually engage, their social networks. Staff members and volunteers parachute into communities to knock on doors and recite poll-tested scripts.
Over the past decade, the party elites — consultants, strategists and donors — have caught the data-and-analytics fever and largely abandoned organizing. This has meant that entire neighborhoods have been politically redlined out of engagement in our most fundamental democratic practice.
Those of us who have spent our lives talking to regular folks on campaigns now walk around neighborhoods with lists created by someone at a computer far away. We have skipped many doors and missed entire families because the data experts didn’t have addresses or phone numbers for poor people, young people, people of color or people who moved a lot — many of those who carried Barack Obama to victory.
Going into 2020, Democrats cannot fall into the trap of being overly seduced by shiny tech-only tricks. They must get back to the hard work of pounding the pavement to organize the people who already want to vote for them. That’s how we’ll create the power to build a movement that attracts others. In fact, data from 2016 and 2018 show that organizing increases voter turnout more than any other single outreach method, including mail, TV and digital advertisements, and twice as much as contact from a stranger.
Part of the reason the debate has unfolded this way is because the story that took hold about how Barack Obama won, and has since permeated the voting industry, is that sophisticated data, technology and analytics twice won him the White House, not organizing or volunteers. That a few dozen tech nerds in the Chicago headquarters tipped the campaign to victory. This story, and the realignment of progressive interests and infrastructure around it, has baffled me and other top campaigners.
People won Mr. Obama’s campaigns. From the black beauticians in South Carolina to the white and black retirees in Pennsylvania to the Latinx supporters in Nevada, hundreds of thousands of volunteers knocked on doors and made calls from the primaries through the general elections. And Barack Obama saw them, spoke to them and loved them.
As the primary campaign heated up in 2007, my colleague Jeremy Bird and I trained and coached organizers in South Carolina to tell their own family stories and to identify community leaders by asking them to host meetings in their homes with their friends and family, to build and train volunteer leadership teams and to equip those teams to make strategic decisions about how to engage voters in their neighborhoods.
The strategy soon paid off. After an incredible win in the Iowa caucuses, the campaign lost in New Hampshire and Nevada. But on Jan. 26, 2008, the volunteers of South Carolina, who had organized block by block to cover the entire state, delivered the primary to Barack Obama with a 29 percent margin over the runner-up, Hillary Clinton, breathing oxygen into the campaign for the months ahead.
We replicated this experience in Pennsylvania. We registered more than 100,000 new voters in just over a month, shifting the electorate there and organizing an animated base that would deliver the state for Mr. Obama in the general election.
Then in the spring of 2008, the campaign leaders took an extraordinary risk. They allowed a few top organizers to hunker down in Chicago to design a field program that required paid staff to organize our base over the summer — predominantly black and young volunteer activists, as well as white and Latinx people who were proud to support a black candidate.
We decided to empower and animate our most excited supporters, rather than working around them, or even worse, betraying them in pursuit of the elusive white swing voter. Most other campaigns would have gone straight to paying staff members to knock on unfamiliar doors and make cold calls.
And we won.
So I was surprised when, after the election, I came bright-eyed into a project where I interviewed senior Democratic consultants to help train campaign managers for the midterms. Here’s what they told me: We’re going to have an extraordinary backlash to President Obama’s victories, so we have to double down on likely white voters. After two cycles of terrible midterm losses, this was, again, the narrative after the 2014 elections.
In the winter of 2015, I sat in a room of about 400 political operatives where Stan Greenberg, a pollster for Bill Clinton, made that very argument from the main stage. His polling data sliced and diced white people in myriad ways: rural/urban/exurban, married/unmarried, college educated/non-college educated, seeking the magic formula that would deliver victory in 2016. But a single spreadsheet column — “People of Color” — had lumped together black, Latinx, Asian-American, Pacific Islander and Native American voters.
This problematic love affair between the analytics masterminds and those on the left focused almost exclusively on white voters is suffocating the Democrats’ base from the top down. As we get closer to the 2020 election, this is the mantra of many progressive political elites and labor groups, epitomized most by Third Way, a centrist think tank, and by Catalist, the dominant data provider for the Democrats and the left’s independent sector.
We’re so afraid of the leadership required to shape a new future that we’re turning on our own base. This retreat is augmented by a hunger for technocratic control that has only delivered further failure. The programs that organize data have come to control the programs that organize people as we eke out marginal returns and obsess over “votes per $1,000 spent.” But remember that Donald Trump won with only a fraction of the resources of Hillary Clinton. He knew he had to animate his own base and was good at doing it.
We will keep losing elections if we continue to campaign this way. In the decade after the 2008 election, Democrats lost more than 1,000 legislative seats in Congress and statehouses using a flawed political formula that targets white suburban and exurban vote flippers with bland policies and a marketing approach to campaigning.
While the spirit of President Obama’s campaigns has withered inside the elite party establishment, it thrives in independent political groups because organizing has been the spirit of social movements for generations.
Young Latinx organizers with LUCHA and other groups in Arizona turned the backlash against a racist immigration law into an organizing infrastructure in 2010, registering hundreds of thousands of Latinos, who then ousted from office the legislator who sponsored that bill, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. They shifted the political terrain so that a Democrat won a Senate seat in 2018.
In Florida, independent organizing groups worked alongside Desmond Meade and the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition to win a landmark ballot measure last year that restored voting rights to as many as 1.5 million formerly incarcerated people.
Since 2014, black and Latinx organizers worked to elect progressive district attorneys in St. Louis, Philadelphia, Tampa and counties across the country, with the support of Faith in Action Fund and Color of Change PAC.
To win in 2020, we must flip the formula on how most strategists and consultants think campaigns are won and instead recognize that an organized and energized base is our most powerful resource, not a liability. That means investing now — not a few weeks before the election — in the development of black, Latinx and youth leaders, as well as hiring consultants and analysts who understand these communities.
We need to use data and analytics to learn why so many voters of color and young people stayed home in 2016 and to figure out what would persuade them and their networks to vote in 2020. Movement donors and campaigns should fund the organizing (not just the door knocking).
We must abandon flawed “voter propensity scores,” assigned before the election to predict a person’s likelihood to cast a ballot. These scores are like party invitations. If you weren’t invited to or didn’t show up to the last party, you don’t get invited again. Or if you have moved since the last party, so we don’t know whether you’ve ever attended parties, you won’t get one.
Each candidate ought to build organizing into the DNA of his or her campaign, and the Democratic Party and independent donors should support this effort. That means hiring and training organizing staff early on. And campaign headquarters should value their data and experiences from the field as much as those of analysts.
The kind of politics that puts people first, invests in organizing and delivers material change in people’s lives will always win. But “the Democrats had the playbook and walked away from it,” a Republican official told a reporter. We need to get back to the basics, before Republicans beat us at our own game."

The Beauty of Being Bilingual
By Natalia Sylvester

My parents refused to let my sister and me forget how to speak Spanish by pretending they didn’t understand when we spoke English. Spanish was the only language we were allowed to speak in our one-bedroom apartment in Miami in the late 1980s. We both graduated from English as a second language lessons in record time as kindergartners and first graders, and we longed to play and talk and live in English as if it were a shiny new toy.
“No te entiendo,” my mother would say, shaking her head and shrugging in feigned confusion anytime we slipped into English. My sister and I would let out exasperated sighs at having to repeat ourselves in Spanish, only to be interrupted by a correction of our grammar and vocabulary after every other word. One day you’ll thank me, my mother retorted.
That day has come to pass 30 years later in ordinary places like Goodwill, a Walmart parking lot, a Costco Tire Center.
I’m most thankful that I can speak Spanish because it has allowed me to help others. There was the young mother who wanted to know whether she could leave a cumbersome diaper bin aside at the register at Goodwill while she shopped. The cashier shook her head dismissively and said she didn’t understand. It wasn’t difficult to read the woman’s gestures — she was struggling to push her baby’s carriage while lugging the large box around the store. Even after I told the cashier what the woman was saying, her irritation was palpable.
The air of judgment is one I’ve come to recognize: How dare this woman not speak English, how dare this other woman speak both English and Spanish. It was a small moment, but it speaks to how easy it would have been for the cashier to ignore a young Latina mother struggling to care for her child had there not been someone around to interpret. “I don’t understand,” she kept saying, though the mother’s gestures transcended language. I choose not to understand is what she really meant.
Those of us who grew up bilingual understand the complexities of holding onto and embracing either language. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said on Twitter, “Growing up, Spanish was my first language — but like many 1st generation Latinx Americans, I have to continuously work at it & improve. It’s not perfect.”
In the Spanish spoken by the children of immigrants, you’ll hear the echoes of cousins laughing at our accents when we visited them in Latin America. If you go back one generation, you’ll hear stories of people like my in-laws, whose teachers in Florida beat them for speaking in school the language they spoke at home. Go back yet another generation and you’ll hear of the state-sanctioned racial terror inflicted on residents of Mexican descent in Texas in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
On videos circulating on social media you’ll hear Americans harassing Spanish-speakers at supermarkets and restaurants. This language of xenophobia and white supremacy is spoken fluently by our own president, and is at the root of why generations of Latinx Americans’ relationship with Spanish is laced with pain.
Those whose parents tried to shield them from discrimination by not passing it on are often expected to be fluent in a language they never had the chance to forget. Those of us who managed to hold on to it, despite the pressures to assimilate, know that our imperfect Spanish is a privilege we are often shamed for both inside and outside of our communities. And those of us who speak only Spanish are too often dismissed and worse, targeted — by women pushing shopping carts, by ICE raids, by gunmen with anti-immigrant manifestoes. Their terror makes victims of us all.
A few weeks before the election in 2016, a woman at a Walmart parking lot in Manor, Tex., ran to the tent where I was helping to register voters; she was in tears because her car had been stolen. In a town that’s nearly 50 percent Latinx, none of the police officers on site could understand her. As she filed her police report, with me as an interpreter, I noticed how they made almost no eye contact with her. I was the one they could understand, so they saw only me. She confided that her immigration papers were in the car.
How do you translate fear to those you cannot trust?
At a Costco Tire Center in Texas this week, a woman asked the man who had just helped me whether he spoke Spanish. He answered no, flatly. I volunteered to interpret. As she reached for her membership card, a familiar image in her wallet, her green card, caught my eye. I recognized it from the thick magnetic strip in the back, the way it gleamed bluish-black.
I found myself interpreting her words verbatim, forgetting to switch from the first person to the third. “The car is under my daughter’s name,” I said. In her face I saw my friends, my mother, my grandmother and me, each of us with different degrees of Spanish and English, all rooted in a desire to feel accepted and understood.
I used to think that being bilingual is what made me a writer, but more and more I see it’s deeper than that. It’s the constant act of interpreting. The journeying back and forth. The discovery that language, and the stories it carries, is not a straight path. Those of us who’ve served as interpreters in everyday life know it’s a bittersweet privilege. You find truths in the in-between spaces of language, but never the right words to express them. You hear the sound of someone being heard in your voice, and the sound of someone being unseen in the silence. You speak of simple things, hard things and joyous things, all diluted by the separation from their source. It will never seem fair that a person’s words are not enough."

The Quinceañera, Redefined
By Walter Thompson-Hernández

Jayla Sheffield, 15, looked to her left and right. She and six friends, all wearing black shorts, white Nikes and T-shirts with the words “Jayla’s Quince,” paused, ready to kick off a night of festivities with a dance routine they had practiced for months.
The occasion, which brought over 100 people together in Pomona, Calif., was what Jayla and her mother, Miranda Sheffield, were calling a “quincenegra” — a term they adopted to honor Jayla’s Afro-Latina background as well as the traditional coming-of-age customs of a classic quinceañera.
Jayla gave a final nod, and the girls flung out their arms and started a hip-hop dance medley. It featured fluid twists and turns, set to pop songs by Cardi B and Bruno Mars along with punta music from Honduras, where Jayla’s father was born.
Quinceañeras like Jayla’s are an integral part of the experiences of young women in Latin America and throughout the United States. They signal a celebratory moment in the lives of teenage girls and, in many families, are seen as a necessary rite of passage.
They are also events that tend to be steeped in generational layers of tradition. They have unspoken dress codes (white or brightly colored dresses for the birthday girl); set gender distinctions (the chambelán, whose job is to escort and dance with the quinceañera, is almost always a young man); and established rituals, both religious and secular (Mass before the party; waltzing at the party).
But there is a growing generation of Latinos and Latinas who are choosing to redefine what quinceañeras mean, eschewing some of the old rules and expanding the purpose of the event.
It is now more common to see quinces as celebrations of identity, including for queer and transgender individuals, and quinces that honor more than the transition to adulthood.
Why Those Moments of Care for Liza Minnelli and Joni Mitchell Felt Different
Double quinces, for example, which are held by those turning 30, are being celebrated by an increasing number of people who may not have been able to afford a quinceañera at age 15, or who would rather celebrate womanhood once they are firmly in it.
For Jayla, the quinceañera was an occasion to celebrate blackness and black womanhood. “Most of my family is black, and I’ve mostly only always been around them,” she said while getting her nails done with her friends a day before the big day. “I wanted all of that to come out in my party, and I also wanted drums and food that honored my Afro-Latina heritage.”
In Bakersfield, Calif., on the same day as Jayla’s quince, Amina Sherif Hamza, 14, had a quinceañera that honored her Muslim faith. Underneath her embroidered black dress she wore a long-sleeve shirt to cover her arms, and she ditched the tradition of having a chambelán and celebrating a Catholic Mass.
Amina, whose father is Egyptian and whose mother is of Guatemalan, Honduran and Native American descent, is part of a horse riding club that competes in escaramuza, a form of traditional Mexican riding and performance done only by women.
So she incorporated that too, appearing at the beginning of the ceremony astride her mother’s horse Chispa. “My dad speaks Arabic and my mom speaks to me in Spanish,” she said. “It’s a taste of both worlds.”
Amina’s mother, Leslie Henderson Oaxaca, converted to Islam in her early 20s, but she grew up in a Catholic family in Long Beach, Calif. She never had a quinceañera of her own, so she had a special devotion to Amina’s.
“This quince isn’t just about me. It’s about our three generations,” Ms. Oaxaca said. “My mom came here in the ’70s and she cleaned houses and went through hell for us, and now she gets to see her granddaughter’s quince. It’s really special.”
Ms. Oaxaca is a single mother, but the wishes of Amina’s father did weigh heavily on how the quince would look and feel. “Her father didn’t want her showing any skin, for religious reasons,” Ms. Oaxaca said. Still, the incorporation of a religion apart from Catholicism felt like a break from the norm.
“This generation is breaking down all of the tradition,” Ms. Oaxaca said. “They are doing their own traditions.”
Helly Toscano, 26, a family friend from Bakersfield who attended the quince, agreed. “My dad is Yemeni and my mom is Mexican, and I wasn’t able to celebrate both sides when I was younger,” she said, while taking photos of Amina on the horse. “I think more people like her are breaking the norm, and I respect her dress and the way she covered up.”
Amina’s generation is “more persistent,” Ms. Toscano said, and “their voices are louder and being heard.”
Quinceañeras are becoming a distinct way to create belonging in the United States, said Stephanie Canizales, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California Merced, who studies Latino immigration and youth.
“Quinceañeras, like other Latinx celebrations in the U.S., are important for a positive identity and space in a political moment where Latinxs are constantly portrayed as social deviants with no place to belong,” she said.
“In the U.S. context, quinceañeras are also a bridge to home country traditions and offer a way of connecting the U.S.-born second generation to the world parents left behind,” Professor Canizales said.
These quinces, both of them private affairs, were, in a larger context, products of shift and change within the Latino community in the United States.
“The changing nature of quinceañeras point to an exciting diversification of the Latinx landscape,” Professor Canizales said. “There is no one-size-fits-all quinceañera celebration. This means there is no one Latinx — and that’s a beautiful landscape.”"

A Whistle-Blower, a Collapsed Hotel, a Deportation
By Deniz Daser and Sarah Fouts

In early October, a worker posted a video of a building under construction that looked like it was about to collapse. It was slated to be a Hard Rock Hotel, just off the French Quarter, its temporary beams bent under the weight of the floors above.
“It’s the best engineering,” the worker said sarcastically in Spanish.
A few days later, parts of the upper floors of the  building crumbled, killing three workers and injuring more than 20 people. One of those injured was Delmer Joel Ramírez Palma, a metal worker who had repeatedly reported safety issues to supervisors.
But after talking to the media about the shoddy work conditions; filing a lawsuit with other workers seeking damages; and becoming a witness in a federal workplace safety investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported him to Honduras on Friday. This has become a pattern in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as across the country: I.C.E. is used as a tool to insulate private development projects from labor and safety regulations.
After the hurricane, much of New Orleans’s black population, historically the bulk of the city’s working class, was forced out of the city in part by failed policies like the Road Home program. So Latinx migrants, a majority of whom were undocumented, filled this void. They made up nearly half of the rebuilding work force and performed risky tasks in toxic conditions like gutting houses, repairing roofs and collecting trash.
To supposedly boost reconstruction efforts, the administration of George W. Bush temporarily suspended federal statutes that would have protected workers’ health and wages. Around the same time, deportation rates in Louisiana rose significantly and continued under the Obama administration. That’s partly because I.C.E. has retaliated against people who have exposed civil rights abuses.
That happened in August 2011, when Latinx employees of Louisiana Home Elevations gathered in the parking lot of an apartment complex to resolve a payment dispute with their contractor. Instead of receiving the thousands of dollars they were due, I.C.E. and local law enforcement detained the workers in a violent raid.
The company was eventually convicted of money laundering. But the migrant workers faced the harshest punishment. Some of the workers were eventually deported. None received any of the $10,000-plus they were collectively owed.
Around that time, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor in the Obama administration reached an agreement that each agency must enforce labor law regardless of a worker’s immigration status. The agreement also specified that I.C.E. would continue to take into account whether it received tips that were called in by someone wanting to retaliate against workers who voiced their labor rights.
But the Trump administration has defied these protections, instead putting in place draconian policies meant to target vulnerable migrant workers. An executive order in 2017 directed agencies to “make use of all available systems and resources” to enforce immigration policy and it ordered I.C.E. to hire 10,000 officers and agents. Meanwhile, federal worker protection agencies, like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, remained understaffed, even though worker deaths are at a 10-year high.
This was the lead-up to the collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel.
An exposé on the incident shows how collusion between developers and federal agencies exacerbated this disaster. The construction company in charge of the project made headlines in 2013 after a New Orleans-area home it was working on collapsed, injuring several immigrant workers. The company changed its name but faced no major repercussions and continued to take on structurally unsound construction projects.
Two days after the building fell, the whistle-blower, Delmer Joel Ramírez Palma, was fishing in a suburb of New Orleans when the Fish and Wildlife Service stopped him for not having a license and turned him over to the Border Patrol, which turned him over to I.C.E. This overreach echoes the demands of the Trump administration’s 2017 executive order. Mr. Ramírez’s lawyer claims his arrest was connected to the media interview and the lawsuit seeking damages. I.C.E. denies this.
It’s clear that prioritizing immigration enforcement over workplace safety enables risk and corruption. Washington must protect all workers regardless of immigration status. Developers should be regulated to ensure worker safety. And, in New Orleans, a city set to experience increasingly dangerous hurricanes and subsequent rebuilding under a climate in crisis, the government must protect the people who help rebuild it."

Denying a Professor Tenure, Harvard Sparks a Debate Over Ethnic Studies
By Kate Taylor

The news spread quickly, angering Latino students and others at Harvard: One of the few professors who specialized in Latino and Caribbean studies and devoted time to mentoring students of color had been denied tenure.
The students sprang into action, occupying an administration building last month and also disrupting a faculty meeting. They submitted a letter to administrators demanding transparency about the tenure process and the creation of an ethnic studies department. And on the day in December that early admissions decisions were to be released, black, Latino and Asian students protested in the admissions office, accusing the university of using them as tokens in its professed commitment to diversity, while failing to invest in academic areas critical to their lives.
It is an unsettled moment at Harvard. The university is still fighting a lawsuit challenging its use of race-based affirmative action in admissions; a district court judge ruled in Harvard’s favor in October, but the plaintiffs are appealing.
But at the very moment that Harvard is defending its use of race in admissions, citing diversity as a key component of the education it provides, students of color are saying that once they are on campus, Harvard devalues their history and experiences and fails to retain professors who support them.
Several students who testified during the legal challenge to Harvard’s admissions policies, saying it was important for the school to be able to consider race in admissions, are now among those criticizing the decision to deny tenure to the professor, Lorgia García Peña.
One of them, Catherine Ho, 20, a junior, took part in the December protest at the admissions office, where students held signs with messages like “After You Admit Us, Don’t Forget Us!” and “Want Diversity? Teach Our Histories!”
Ms. Ho, who is Vietnamese-American, accused Harvard of using her and other students who testified to burnish its image at the trial and afterward, while refusing to listen to what they said they needed in terms of resources once they got to campus.
“I am tired of Harvard using my story without giving me ethnic studies so I can fully understand what my story even means,” Ms. Ho said during the protest, to cheers from the other students. She added, “Harvard, stop using our stories when you won’t listen to us.”
Another student, Laura Veira-Ramirez, 21, a senior, was one of several who worked part-time in the admissions office, doing outreach to minority applicants or those who came from poor backgrounds or would be the first in their families to go to college.
Lately, she said, she and other students had felt uncomfortable about reassuring those prospective students that they would feel welcome at Harvard.
“We need more than just letting us in,” said Ms. Veira-Ramirez, who came to the United States from Colombia when she was 3 years old. Ms. Veira-Ramirez, who is undocumented, has protection from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants.
“We need resources once we get to campus,” she said, “and part of those resources is an ethnic studies program.”
The students have not been alone in voicing concern over the decision to deny tenure to Dr. García Peña. Scholars from around the country have written to Harvard’s president expressing dismay with the decision, and Harvard faculty have demanded a review of the tenure process, with an eye to whether it is undermining the university’s effort to diversify its faculty.
Dr. García Peña declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Harvard.
Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard’s president, has declined to discuss the reasons for denying Dr. García Peña tenure, citing the confidentiality of the process. The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gay, has said that she wants to increase offerings in ethnic studies but believes that hiring more faculty must come first, before creating a new major. Last June, she announced that Harvard would hire three to four new faculty working in ethnic studies; the search is still continuing. Dr. Gay also said in response to the faculty concerns that she would conduct a review of the tenure process.
Just 81 of Harvard’s 2,490 faculty members identify as Hispanic, according to Harvard’s Fact Book; the university would not say how many of those are tenured. According to a 2019 report on faculty diversity, 8 percent of the roughly 1,000 tenured faculty are underrepresented minorities, which includes people who are black, Latino and Native American. Of the tenure-track faculty, 12 percent are underrepresented minorities.
The controversy echoes recent conflicts at other schools. At Yale last March, 13 professors withdrew from the university’s Ethnicity, Race and Migration program, citing a lack of support; the professors later rejoined the program after the university agreed to increase its resources. At Dartmouth, an English professor who specialized in Asian-American studies was denied tenure in 2016, setting off an uproar among students and faculty about the college’s failure to attract and retain faculty of color and the treatment of faculty who specialized in the studies of race, gender and sexuality.
A spokeswoman for Dartmouth, Diana Lawrence, said, “Although we cannot comment on confidential tenure matters, Dartmouth is committed to inclusivity and diversity and has been steadily increasing its recruitment and retention of faculty and staff of color.”
Efforts to create an ethnic studies program at Harvard go back several decades. Undergraduates now have two ways to pursue ethnic studies: Students majoring in history and literature can focus on the subject, and students can minor in ethnicity, migration, rights. The ethnic studies track in history and literature was created in 2017, the minor in 2009. The students who are protesting now want a full-fledged department and the opportunity to major in ethnic studies.
Dr. García Peña has been involved in both of the existing programs, as well as the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures’ program in Latinx studies. (Latinx is a gender-neutral term for people of Latin American heritage, used commonly in academia.)
In an online article published last year, Dr. García Peña wrote that ethnic studies programs make universities “a little less racist, a little less white.”
“They provide students with spaces for thinking and writing about important questions,” she wrote. “They also provide support for students of color who are made to feel in every other course, like second class citizens who are reminded that they don’t belong.”
In December, a group of Harvard faculty and administrators who teach in Asian-American, Latino and Native American studies or run the existing programs that support ethnic studies released a letter about Dr. García Peña’s tenure denial that was suffused with a sense of frustration with what they said was the continual institutional resistance faced by their fields.
They said that the denial of tenure to Dr. García Peña had “severe repercussions” on their efforts to recruit and retain top faculty in their disciplines.
“While we understand that receiving tenure at Harvard is never assured,” they wrote, “questions about the fairness of the promotion process for faculty in fields long misunderstood and dismissed at the university will inevitably arise until they are afforded the respect and resources given to other areas of study.”
The tenure process at Harvard is shrouded in secrecy. Dr. García Peña’s colleagues in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures voted unanimously to recommend her for tenure. Mr. Bacow then consulted a committee of experts from within and outside Harvard who remain anonymous, before denying Dr. García Peña tenure.
In the 2018-19 school year, 69 percent of completed tenure reviews in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were successful. The previous year, the figure was 79 percent.
Faculty and students have questioned whether the process involving Dr. García Peña was fair, citing her academic accomplishments, which include a book about the construction of Dominican racial and national identity. Some argued that the decision reflects an institutional lack of respect for work in ethnic studies, as well as a failure to reward the work of mentoring and supporting students.
Robert Reid-Pharr, a professor in the departments of Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality and African and African American Studies, said, “We need to ask, not just in her but in all cases, how it is that certain faculty members — particularly people of color, particularly women — are being asked to do all sorts of extra work, but that work is not necessarily properly judged, or remunerated for that matter.”
Dr. García Peña’s supporters have also cited two troubling incidents from last year. In September, Dr. García Peña found a hateful note tacked to her office door that attacked her race and gender. And in October, several students of color in one of her classes were questioned by Harvard University police officers when they were putting up an art project in Harvard Yard, an activity for which Dr. García Peña had received permission.
Cornel R. West, who holds a joint appointment between Harvard Divinity School and the Department of African and African American Studies, said that many students believed that the decision to deny tenure for Dr. García Peña was driven by racism and sexism. He said he did not think that was the case, at least without clear evidence, but he did think that the decision was wrong.
“She belongs at Harvard, period,” he said.
Ms. Veira-Ramirez, the senior who participated in the admissions office protest, said that Dr. García Peña was focused on helping students like her feel at home at one of the country’s most elite universities.
“She wanted us to take up space at Harvard,” she said. She recalled that, last fall, she had gone to the first meeting of one of Dr. García Peña’s classes and found the room packed, with people sitting on the floor and standing against the walls.
Dr. García Peña’s response was telling, Ms. Veira-Ramirez said.
“She said, ‘This room is not big enough, because Harvard doesn’t think that we can fill a room for Latinx studies.’”"

J.Lo Was Robbed. Latinas Were Robbed.
By Carlos Aguilar

Jennifer Lopez was having a moment.
For her performance as an enterprising exotic dancer in Lorene Scafaria’s “Hustlers,” the Ms. Lopez earned some of the highest praise of her career. A strong awards season campaign was mounted, and she was honored with a string of nominations and wins among film critics’ circles at the end of last year. Momentum seemed to be building for her to earn a nod for a best supporting actress Oscar — with most awards season pundits deeming Ms. Lopez’s chances in the category a fairly sure bet.
Yet on Monday, Ms. Lopez’s name was not among those announced during the Oscar nominations unveiling. The extreme disappointment I feel is twofold.
While the track record of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a measurement of artistic excellence is debatable, its cultural cachet is undeniable. A nomination for Ms. Lopez would have burnished her legacy as an actress, more than 25 years after her breakout role in “Selena.”
Even more dispiriting is what Ms. Lopez’s snub means for Latinx representation more broadly — Ms. Lopez was the only Latinx performer with a real shot of recognition in the major categories this year and seemed to shoulder much of the burden of fending off another #OscarsSoWhite. (A kind reminder that the Spanish-born Antonio Banderas, who earned a deserved nomination for best actor for “Pain and Glory,” is not Latinx.)
The absence of Latinx representation is a longstanding issue for the academy. Had she been nominated, Ms. Lopez would have been the first American Latinx actress singled out by the academy since Rosie Perez, who earned a best supporting actress nod in 1994 for “Fearless.” The magnitude of this quarter-of-a-century gap might be difficult for some to understand at first — the entertainment industry tends to lump together American-born Latinxes, Latin Americans and Hispanics into a monolithic entity, inaccurately plumping numbers in otherwise well-intentioned studies about diversity.
Indeed, only a handful of American Latinx actors have ever been nominated for film’s highest acting honors: In addition to Ms. Perez, they include Rita Moreno (who won in 1962), José Ferrer (a winner in 1951), Edward James Olmos (nominated in 1989) and Benicio del Toro (a winner in 2001).
If only American-born Latinxes were considered in the data research focused on diversity in studio productions and what types of roles they are offered, calling the results dismal would be an understatement. And then there’s the fact that no American Latinx filmmaker has ever been nominated for the best director Academy Award, in part because they are rarely considered to helm the “prestige” films Oscar voters are usually attracted to.
It’s evident that an illusion of inclusion in relation to Latinx people has permeated Hollywood over the past decade. The heavily decorated Mexican directors Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro — collectively referred to as “the Three Amigos” — have served as a flimsy Band-Aid to an industry that heralds their accomplishments as proof that everyone who matches their idea of Latinx is being celebrated.
Mr. Cuarón’s “Roma,” a Latin American behemoth backed by Netflix, took home three awards at last year’s ceremony. This followed closely on the heels of Mr. Iñárritu’s “Birdman” and “The Revenant,” Mr. del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” and Mr. Cuarón’s “Gravity,” all awarded some of the highest honors by the academy. A narrative of substantial Latinx representation was constructed, one that doesn’t acknowledge how that representation hasn’t translated to the screen even in works by Latin American filmmakers. (Aside from “Roma,” which is set in Mexico with Spanish dialogue, those other films starred the likes of Sandra Bullock, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Keaton.) And stateside Latinx creators have been virtually erased both onscreen and behind the camera.
This year, without any of the men in the overachieving trio in the race, the mirage of collective advancement has vanished. While the Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto received his third nomination, for “The Irishman,” and the Brazilian filmmaker Petra Costa was nominated for her documentary “The Edge of Democracy,” they serve as little consolation. Ms. Lopez’s snub should show pundits and other observers how blatant the exclusion truly is, not only from the glitz of the red carpet, but more alarmingly, from the production pipeline as a whole.
A good start on the path to overhauling this outrageous reality is for more people in high places to become aware that Latin American and United States-born Latinx people aren’t granted the same opportunities, nor are their stories, while related, the same.
The few Latin American actresses who’ve been shortlisted for the acting categories in recent memory have delivered monumental performances playing characters exhibiting familiar tropes: Mexico’s Adriana Barraza in “Babel” as a nanny crossing the border who is eventually deported; Colombia’s Catalina Sandino Moreno in “Maria Full of Grace” as a drug mule; and more recently, Yalitza Aparicio in “Roma” as a housekeeper for an upper-middle-class family in 1970s Mexico City.
What’s noteworthy about Ms. Lopez’s turn is that it does not abide by preconceived and clichéd expectations of who a Latinx woman is, specifically one born and raised in the United States.
In a recent interview with Variety, Ms. Lopez recalled the limiting biases that affected the jobs she was offered early in her career: “Maybe 30 years ago, it was very ‘Oh, you’re the Latin girl,’ ” she said. “‘You’ll do Spanish roles; you’ll play maids; you’ll only be limited to this little box.’ ”
Characters that are unambiguously Latinx, but are depicted beyond their cultural identity, are a rarity — in several of Ms. Lopez’s earlier roles, she often portrayed women who could arguably be coded as white. But as Ramona in “Hustlers,” she doesn’t have to erase her ethnicity. Ramona isn’t a Latinx stereotype. There’s no use of Spanish-language dialogue or references to her abuela to make the point that she is a Nuyorican.
But the hints are there — her last name is Vega, and the actress Emma Batiz, who plays her daughter in the film, is also Latinx. And of course and above all, it’s J.Lo in a role she was meant to play, a role that shows off her strengths, while allowing her to become the force of nature she hasn’t always seen herself as.
“I’ve always been so much a romantic, so much about having a relationship, and this woman is the total opposite,” she told A.O. Scott in an interview for The New York Times Magazine. “And to play that, to live in those shoes, to walk in those very high heels, in that skin, made me realize I’m out here on my own. That’s what I need to teach my daughter, that aspect of it, that you can do it on your own.”
Ms. Lopez was Lorene Scafaria’s first choice for Ramona in “Hustlers,” and through Ms. Lopez’s company, Nuyorican Productions, the actress served as a producer of the film. But a couple of questions arise: If it has taken this long for a household name like Ms. Lopez to attain such a meaty and perfectly tailored part, what’s the fate of those emerging Latinx voices without such clout?
And what does it mean that this type of Latinx character — not a maid, not a drug mule, not a nanny — wasn’t acknowledged by the academy?
Ms. Lopez will be fine; her degree of superstardom and ability to produce her own projects should hopefully ensure even more great roles for her. But even if she had been nominated this year, no one person can or should shoulder all that responsibility. It’s imperative to have a wide array of Latinxes partaking in all disciplines.
Pioneers and symbols are important — needed even, as lighthouses in oceans where role models have been scarce — but more so is foundational change to an industry that continues to bet on our money as audiences, but not our talent and stories."

‘Very Male, Very White’: Let’s Talk About Those Oscar Nominations
By Spencer Bokat-Lindell


The academy’s choice not to nominate Ms. Lopez for “Hustlers” dispels the “illusion of inclusion in relation to Latinx people” that has recently permeated Hollywood, Carlos Aguilar writes in The Times. (In his review of “Hustlers,” A.O. Scott, The Times’s chief film critic, called Ms. Lopez’s performance a “finely calibrated,” “incandescent one-woman spectacle” that in some ways outshone the movie.)
But even more dispiriting than Ms. Lopez’s snub itself, Mr. Aguilar writes, are its implications for Latinx representation in the industry more broadly.
He notes that in the academy’s 92-year history, only a handful of American-born Latinx actors have ever been nominated for the highest acting honors.
Ms. Lopez would have been the first American Latina actress to get a nod since Rosie Perez in 1994.
The few Latin American actresses who have been shortlisted in recent memory played characters exhibiting “familiar tropes,” he adds. “What’s noteworthy about Ms. Lopez’s turn is that it does not abide by preconceived and clichéd expectations of who a Latinx woman is, specifically one born and raised in the United States,” he writes. “What does it mean that this type of Latinx character — not a maid, not a drug mule, not a nanny — wasn’t acknowledged by the academy?”
A version of that question has also been asked about Lupita Nyong’o, who won for best supporting actress in 2014 for her portrayal of Patsey in “12 Years a Slave,” but whose mirrored performance in Jordan Peele’s “Us” (“dazzling,” according to The Times; “virtuosic,” according to The New Yorker) went unrecognized this year.
“It legitimizes this idea that black stories must revolve around sorrow and loss in order to be seen as important,” says Angelica Jade Bastién at Vulture, who called Ms. Erivo’s “Harriet” performance “stunningly forgettable.”"

Pete Davidson’s ‘King of Staten Island’ Will Open South by Southwest 2020
By Mekado Murphy

The first high-profile leading role for the “Saturday Night Live” cast member Pete Davidson will be showcased at this year’s South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin.
“The King of Staten Island,” directed by Judd Apatow, will have its premiere on March 13, the festival announced on Wednesday. Apatow’s work has regularly appeared in the festival, but this is the first time one of his features will get the opening-night  slot.
Davidson plays a struggling young man living at home with his mother (Marisa Tomei). The movie is inspired by the star’s experiences growing up in the borough. The actor, who has been public about his bouts with mental health issues, co-wrote the screenplay with Apatow and Dave Sirus.
This is Apatow’s first narrative feature since his collaboration with Amy Schumer in 2015, “Trainwreck,” which also had its premiere at SXSW. “The King of Staten Island” will open nationwide June 19.
The festival also announced its features and episodics slate, which consists of more than 100 titles. Film highlights include “Beastie Boys Story,” a documentary on the band by Spike Jonze; “The Lovebirds,” a murder mystery comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani; “Critical Thinking,” John Leguizamo’s look at a group of black and Latinx teenagers who become national championship chess players; and “Clerk,” a documentary about the filmmaker Kevin Smith by Malcolm Ingram.
The festival, which runs March 13-22, will also premiere episodes of “Snowpiercer,” the TNT series based on the Oscar nominee Bong Joon Ho’s 2013 film, and “Central Park,” the animated musical comedy coming to Apple TV Plus."

‘American Dirt’ Is Proof the Publishing Industry Is Broken
By David Bowles

You’ve most likely caught wind of the controversy surrounding Jeanine Cummins’s newly published novel “American Dirt.” In it, Lydia Quixano Pérez, a Mexican bookseller, finds herself fleeing to the United States with her son Luca, pursued by an obsessed drug cartel boss. The telenovela plot is a pastiche of stereotypes and melodramatic tropes of the sort one might expect from an author who did not grow up within Mexican culture, from a massacre at a quinceañera to the inexplicable choice of a relatively wealthy woman to leap onto La Bestia, a gang-controlled train — rather than just take a plane to Canada.
Despite the multiple cultural inaccuracies and Spanish dialogue of Google Translate quality sprinkled throughout, the manuscript was acquired by Flatiron Books for seven figures in a nine-way bidding war. Hailed as a modern-day “The Grapes of Wrath” by the writer Don Winslow, it was heavily promoted for a year, poised to be the book on the immigrant crisis.
But “American Dirt” has now been largely rejected by the very Mexicans and Mexican Americans it was meant to foreground, the “faceless brown mass” Ms. Cummins — who has a Puerto_Rican grandmother and identifies as white — sought to humanize.
That “brown mass” includes the people in my Mexican-American community here in South Texas.
The white saviorism is tough for me to swallow, and not just because I’m a Chicano writer critical of “American Dirt.” My hometown library was chosen in late 2019 to be part of a pilot partnership between Oprah’s Book Club, the American Library Association and local library book groups. The libraries would receive several boxes of books to use with patrons in their book club, as well as other discussion and promotional materials.
Last week I was in touch with Kate Horan, the director of the McAllen Public Library here, via phone and email. She told me she felt “excited and honored” by the news, “proud that our library on the border with Mexico was recognized and selected to be part of a new initiative.”
No one at the library knew which book had been selected: Ms. Winfrey keeps titles a tightly guarded secret. But Ms. Horan was told that it would be “the most talked about book of the year.” Instructions were given: Upon arrival of the shipment, the library should film an “unboxing” video and submit it to Ms. Winfrey.
The boxes arrived on Jan. 17. Upon opening them, Ms. Horan said, her “heart sank,” and she immediately recoiled at this “deliberate assumption that libraries on the border, who were selected to receive the books, would be automatic endorsers, given the subject matter.”
She sent the unboxing video off, and after two agonizing days consulting with her predominantly Latinx staff and others, she decided to send the books back, and politely declined to participate in the pilot program.
What Ms. Horan did is a rare thing to see from a person in power within the literary world — a world where it’s much more likely that the gatekeepers and institutional systems in place will fashion books out of fraught manuscripts simply because they are practically guaranteed to stir up buzz.
Much of the problem lies with the publishing industry. For each of the biggest companies — including Macmillan and Simon & Schuster — a book is anointed each season or year as The One. The limelight is thrown upon it. The bulk of the promotional budget is funneled toward it. Reporters are marshaled to support it. The book is pushed hard with established chains and indie booksellers.
They make it a success. Ostensibly, this effort offsets the weaker sales of other titles. One or two big hits, such as Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” or Michelle Obama’s memoir “Becoming,” can subsidize a publishing house’s less trendy offerings. But look too hard at this model, and its flaws become clear. It costs a fortune to make a book a best seller. (Again, Ms. Cummins received a seven-figure deal for “American Dirt.”)
And there are other allied mechanisms applying pressure to the market, such as endorsements by celebrities, tastemakers and influencers. Early “American Dirt” blurbs from prominent writers, several of them Latinas (Sandra Cisneros, Erika Sánchez), have recently been underscored by book selfies from prominent Latina movie stars (Yalitza Aparicio, Salma Hayek, Gina Rodríguez).
Perhaps the most significant imprimatur a new release can get is selection by Oprah’s Book Club. Established in 1996, the initiative selects up to five books each year based on criteria known only to Ms. Winfrey. The list is mostly books by white and African-American authors, ranging from obscure literary fiction to pulpy popular thrillers. Uncomfortably, not one of the 82 books selected so far was written by a Mexican or Mexican-American. Only four are by Latinx or Latin American authors.
According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Oprah’s Book Club has proved to be the greatest outside influence on sales in the market. As you might imagine, there’s a downside to her ability to ensure a best seller: The economist Craig L. Garthwaite has found that for at least 12 weeks after the club’s announcement, sales of other adult books decline.
In turning down the offer with Oprah’s Book Club, Ms. Horan was willing to put her reputation and job on the line. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this act. Ms. Horan runs what is believed to be one of the largest single-story libraries in the country. She holds leadership positions in multiple organizations. She’s a powerful figure in literacy on the state and national level.
And she was a collaborator, standing with us. The underrepresented. The less powerful. The A.L.A. knew from the beginning what title had been selected. That’s why they suggested the McAllen Public Library as the best venue for promoting this atrocious piece of cultural appropriation.
Pantalla, we say in Mexican Spanish. A smoke screen. Just like the book selfies. A mechanism for ensuring the greatest profit and least amount of criticism.
The clumsy, ill-conceived rollout of “American Dirt” illustrates how broken the system is, how myopic it is to hype one book at the expense of others and how unethical it is to allow a gatekeeper like Oprah’s Book Club to wield such power.
Imagine a publishing industry that dispensed with hit-making, that used the millions of dollars poured into “American Dirt” to invest more into promoting a greater number and panoply of authors. Even Ms. Cummins recognizes the unfairness of the system: “That’s not a problem that I can fix, nor is it a problem that I’m responsible for,” she recently told NPR.
The A.L.A. likely would have preferred that Ms. Horan quietly decline rather than make a public statement. Ms. Cummins and Flatiron Books probably would have preferred that Latinx writers and critics like Myriam Gurba and I just kept our mouths shut and let this book go unchecked.
To her credit, Ms. Winfrey has publicly acknowledged the critiques from Latinx people. In an Instagram video on Sunday, she said that the book warrants a “deeper, more substantive discussion” and announced plans for a special set to stream on Apple TV Plus in March.
Perhaps, if it weren’t for all of the promotional hype, it would have been easy to dismiss as a poorly executed work not worth paying attention to.
But the industry as it exists forced us to pay attention to it. And we — Mexican Americans and collaborators alike — refuse to be silent. We’ll never meekly submit our stories, our pain, our dignity to the ever-grinding wheels of the hit-making machine."

‘American Dirt’ Publisher Cancels Book Tour
By Concepción de León and Alexandra Alter

Flatiron Books, the publisher of “American Dirt,” said Wednesday that it was canceling the author’s book tour because of safety concerns.
In a statement, Bob Miller, Flatiron’s president and publisher, said, “Based on specific threats to booksellers and the author, we believe there exists real peril to their safety.”
“American Dirt,” a novel by Jeanine Cummins about a Mexican woman and her son fleeing to the United States to escape cartel violence, came out last week and seemed poised to become one of the year’s biggest books. It made its debut at No. 1 on The New York Times’s best-seller list for hardcover and for combined print and e-book fiction this week. But the book has also encountered a backlash, with Latinx writers and community members criticizing Cummins’s depiction of the migrant experience and accusing her of appropriating it for profit.
Miller acknowledged some of the criticism in his statement, saying that “we made serious mistakes in the way we rolled out this book.” He added: “The discussion around this book has exposed deep inadequacies in how we at Flatiron Books address issues of representation, both in the books we publish and in the teams that work on them.”
He said “there have been threats of physical violence,” which prompted the cancellation. Instead, the publisher plans to organize town-hall-style meetings featuring Cummins and “some of the groups who have raised objections to the book.”
Some of the book’s critics, however, expressed skepticism about the threats. “We have no knowledge or involvement in these safety concerns,” said Roberto Lovato, a writer involved in the media campaign #DignidadLiteraria, which has encouraged debate over “American Dirt” and sought to highlight the works of other Latinx writers.
Cummins “has a right to come out and share her book like any other author,” Lovato said. “We have a right to be critical of what we consider bad literature that doesn’t represent the serious issues that we deal with every day.”
The controversy surrounding “American Dirt” “has sparked an overdue public conversation,” the free-speech nonprofit PEN America said in a statement.
“As defenders of freedom of expression, we categorically reject rigid rules about who has the right to tell which stories. We see no contradiction between that position and the need for the publishing industry to urgently address its own chronic shortcomings,” it added. “If the fury over this book can catalyze concrete change in how books are sourced, edited, and promoted, it will have achieved something important.”
PEN also condemned overheated online rhetoric and “vitriol aimed to shut down discussion and enforce silence.”
Another free speech organization, the American Booksellers for Free Expression, echoed those views in a statement on Wednesday, saying the group opposes “any actions expressly intended to cancel author or book events regarding ‘American Dirt’ or any title,” and advocating for the right of booksellers “to curate their stores and to schedule events as they see fit, in light of their communities and the staff.”
Flatiron originally planned an elaborate book tour for “American Dirt,” with appearances in 40 cities across the country. Some bookstores found themselves under pressure to pull the plug on their events even before the publisher’s announcement.
Valerie Koehler, the owner of Blue Willow Bookshop in Houston, canceled a signing this week for “American Dirt” after receiving multiple emails and phone calls from people who threatened to organize a boycott of the store and to protest during the signing. Blue Willow is still selling the book.
“The vitriol level on this has been high and pretty disturbing to me,” she said. “We felt like it was best we not subject our customers to that.”
Left Bank Books, an independent store in St. Louis, also called off an event with Cummins after receiving numerous messages urging the store to cancel her appearance. “We sincerely believed it would be an opportunity to have an overdue public conversation about the deplorable actions of our country towards people at the border,” a note on the store’s website says. The store said the criticisms “felt like a challenge to do better.”
“Everything was so escalated, we wanted to slow down, stop and back away,” said Kris Kleindienst, co-owner of Left Bank. “We are carrying the book and are happy to talk about it anytime.”
Oprah Winfrey, who selected “American Dirt” as her January book club pick, has also attracted criticism for her choice. She later said that she would “bring people together from all sides to talk about this book and who gets to publish what stories” and would stream the conversation on her Apple TV Plus show in March.
Members of #DignidadLiteraria said in a statement on Tuesday that they “have no interest in a dialogue with Jeanine Cummins” but would rather focus on systemic issues of inclusion within Oprah’s book club and the publishing industry.
On Wednesday, more than 80 writers, many of them award-winning novelists of color such as Carmen Maria Machado, Viet Thanh Nguyen and Luis Alberto Urrea, signed a letter asking Winfrey to reconsider her selection of “American Dirt.”
“The book club provides a seal of approval that can still, we hope, be changed,” read the letter that was published on Literary Hub. “The book is widely and strongly believed to be exploitative, oversimplified, and ill-informed, too often erring on the side of trauma fetishization and sensationalization of migration and of Mexican life and culture.”
Some booksellers said it was unfortunate that independent stores had been mired in the controversy.
“I really feel for these bookstores that are under pressure to cancel events that they were trying to host to engage the public in a broader discussion,” said Lissa Muscatine, the co-owner of Politics & Prose in Washington, D.C., which hosted an event with Cummins last week. “The public may have a right to be critical of the author, and our events make room for that.”
She added that the store hadn’t received any complaints from customers about the event for “American Dirt,” and that the conversation around the novel had been “very lively and very engaged.”"

Barnes & Noble, Criticized for Book Covers, Pulls Plug on Diverse Editions Project
By  Concepción de León

Barnes & Noble said Wednesday that it would cancel its plans to promote classic novels featuring covers with people of color, after criticism from writers and others in publishing that it was a misguided attempt at diversifying its shelves.
For the project, called Diverse Editions and intended “to raise awareness and discussion during Black History Month,” the bookseller worked with Penguin Random House and used artificial intelligence to look through 100 books — including “The Secret Garden,” “Romeo and Juliet” and “Moby-Dick” — that it said made no reference to the race of their characters. Artists then created limited-edition covers for 12, reimagining the characters as people of color.
Each book received five different covers depicting ethnically diverse characters. The covers for “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” for instance, included one featuring an Asian Dorothy with a pink dress, as well as black and Native American versions of the character. Barnes & Noble planned to promote the redesigned books at one of its biggest stores, on New York City’s Fifth Avenue, and at a panel session on diversity Wednesday evening.
But the project quickly encountered criticism from writers who questioned why these books were promoted instead of ones written by or featuring African-Americans. The writer Rod T. Faulkner called the project “literary blackface” in a Medium essay. On Twitter, Angie Thomas, the author of the young-adult novel “The Hate U Give,” wrote that the company should instead: “Promote books by authors of color. Just a thought.”
“We acknowledge the voices who have expressed concerns about the Diverse Editions project at our Barnes & Noble Fifth Avenue store and have decided to suspend the initiative,” Barnes & Noble said in a statement. “The covers are not a substitute for black voices or writers of color, whose work and voices deserve to be heard.”
Penguin Random House didn’t respond to a request for comment, and Barnes & Noble canceled Wednesday’s panel session.
MK Asante, an author who was scheduled to participate in the panel, said he was critical of the project. “What I was going to do is talk about the history of black voices in literature,” he said, “the importance of black voices in literature, the importance of not changing the cover, but changing the content, changing the way that we think about a classic. What is a classic? Classic to whom?”
The backlash to Barnes & Noble’s initiative was the latest challenge the publishing and literary worlds have faced over how they approach race and diversity. The novel “American Dirt,” which came out last month, has been criticized as inaccurately depicting Mexican culture and immigrants and benefiting from an industry that doesn’t recognize Latinx writers.
Late last year, the Romance Writers of America, a trade organization, was roiled by disputes over how it handled a racism complaint by one of its members and for what many romance writers considered the longstanding marginalization of writers of color within the genre.
Earlier this week, several Latinx writers — including Roberto Lovato, Myriam Gurba and David Bowles — met with executives at Flatiron Books, the publisher of “American Dirt,” and its parent company, Macmillan. Flatiron subsequently said it would “substantially increase Latinx representation across Macmillan, including authors, titles, staff and our overall literary ecosystem.”
Barnes & Noble, in its statement, said its stores nationally would “continue to highlight a wide selection of books to celebrate black history and great literature from writers of color.”"

What I Wanted to Say in ‘The Inheritance.’ And What I Didn’t
By Matthew Lopez

Theatergoers of different generations have had passionate responses to “The Inheritance,” Matthew Lopez’s two-part play about gay culture and the legacy of AIDS. The show was celebrated in its original runs in London, but the reception has been more divided on Broadway, both among professional critics and regular attendees. While many have found the show inordinately moving, others have criticized a lack of diversity in the central cast and narrow representation of contemporary gay life. We asked Lopez to write about what inspired the play and to reflect on why some audience members don’t like what they see.
In March 2018, my play “The Inheritance” began performances in London. Until its first preview, it was anyone’s guess how it would be received. A reimagining of E.M. Forster’s “Howards End” — using three generations of gay New Yorkers to explore class, community and the legacy of H.I.V. — hardly bears the makings of an obvious hit. And yet audiences, then critics, embraced the play.
Since then, over 200,000 ticket-buyers have seen the play in its three productions, two in London and now on Broadway. Almost every one of those people, whether belonging to or allied with the L.G.B.T.Q. community, has a story to share relating to its themes. I have heard from many of them — people who, after seeing the play, have healed broken relationships with their queer children, have decided to save their lives by seeking help for addiction, have finally put away their grief over those they lost during the epidemic.
My journey to writing it began when I was 15 years old, watching the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of “Howards End.” Somehow a gay Puerto_Rican kid from the Florida panhandle was able to see some part of his experience reflected back in the story of the Schlegel sisters. He could identify with scenes of Londoners making sense of life at the turn of the last century, and even find a version of his abuela in the character of Ruth Wilcox.
I fell madly in love with Forster that day. We are an unlikely couple. But, besides my marriage, it has been the happiest union of my life. At least Forster doesn’t make me go buy eggs at 7 in the morning.
In writing “The Inheritance,” I wanted to take my favorite novel and retell it in a way that its closeted author never felt free to do in his lifetime. I wanted to write a play that was true to my experience, my philosophy, my heart as a gay man who has enjoyed opportunities that were denied Forster. It was my attempt to explain myself to the world as a gay man of my particular generation.
I wasn’t attempting to create a generationally defining work of theater that spoke for the entire queer experience. I think that if I had started with that intention, I never would have finished. There are some who feel the play should have done just that, and who fault me for not painting on a broader canvas.
Those responses led me to wonder: What do we expect from art, particularly when it is made by members of our own community? And, conversely, what are the responsibilities of artists to the communities to which they belong?
Art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. Even with its long running time, there is a lot “The Inheritance” does not and cannot cover.
No one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for “The Inheritance” and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.
“The Inheritance” was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.
I wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.
Such examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don’t understand the cause of the injury.
And while I examine race in “The Inheritance,” it is not one of its central themes. This is a decision for which I have been criticized, but it is a decision that I made consciously as a person of color. It is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.
Responsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. I believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, I have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a Puerto_Rican man.
I have been asked by some why I didn’t write “The Inheritance” from a Latinx perspective. It is a question that reveals to me just how far we have to go in understanding the true nature of diversity of expression. I answer: Can you not see how, by virtue of the fact that I have written it, “The Inheritance” is a reflection of a Latinx perspective?
It reminds me of Sonia Sotomayor’s formulation that “a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would, more often than not, reach a better conclusion” than her white colleagues. Justice Sotomayor is not given only the Puerto_Rican cases to decide; she helps decide all the cases. And her decisions are based just as much on her knowledge of the law as it is by her experiences as a Puerto_Rican woman.
The same is true for “The Inheritance” and me. It is because I am Puerto_Rican that “The Inheritance” is the play it is, not in spite of it. Eric Glass, my central character, may be a white man, but he is a white man who was created by a Puerto_Rican one. That has fundamentally informed his journey through the play.
Others have questioned why there isn’t more representation of the younger generation in the play. It is true that most of the characters are near or close to my age. That is partly due to the function of adaptation — the Schlegel sisters (who became the mid-30s boyfriends Eric Glass and Toby Darling) are, after all, the central characters in “Howards End.” It is also a function of my own perspective. I wrote mostly about people in their 30s because that’s the experience I was living as I wrote the play.
There is a reason, however, that I chose to end the play in the future, focusing on the creative output of the youngest and most marginalized character in the play. I end “The Inheritance” with the acknowledgment that the future has yet to be written — and when it is, it will be written by the youngest among us.
My hope is that, while not presuming to speak for the younger generation, I have spoken to it, and that its members might come to the play in an attempt to understand the life of someone who came before them, and who, for better or worse, through his words and actions helped shape the world that they will inherit."

Let ‘West Side Story’ and Its Stereotypes Die
By Carina del Valle Schorske

For many years I’ve avoided writing about “West Side Story.” As a Puerto_Rican critic, I resent the expectation that I have something to say about a musty old musical from 1957.
Just as the U.S. government bestowed second-class American citizenship upon islanders in 1917 without popular consent, “West Side Story” continues to recruit us as extras even when we never intended to audition for the show. The Puerto_Rican writer Nelson Rivera once recalled studying abroad in Paris, where he was greeted by “Oui, ‘West Side Story’!” at every turn, as if collecting stamps in the passport of an imaginary nation everyone else thought was real.
But the show remains one of the most enduring representations of Puerto_Rican life in American pop culture, and the entertainment industry won’t leave it alone. A new movie adaptation from Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner is coming to theaters this year, and a modernized production by the Belgian director Ivo van Hove is the latest Broadway revival.
So when my literary agent reached out with free tickets for a dress rehearsal in December — the show officially opened on Thursday — it felt like my long-delayed civic responsibility to bear witness. I clipped on my gold hoops and painted my lips red, as if for battle, tweeting a selfie before I left for the theater: “Always Anita, never Maria.”
My mother taught me to resist the cartoonish stereotypes of macho teenage gangsters and hysterical lovers in “West Side Story.” But I also know that when the 1961 movie version came out, she and her friends went to see it twice at the local theater in Washington Heights and cheered when the Sharks came onscreen. If this musical is still our narrative ghetto, then the least we can do is make noise about what it feels like to live in it.
In 2020, it feels exhausting.
There’s no doubt that “West Side Story” has long functioned as a vehicle for great performances by Latinx artists, despite the fact that the lead Puerto_Rican roles of Maria and Bernardo in major productions have most often gone to white actors in brownface. Rita Moreno’s best supporting actress Oscar for her brilliant turn as Anita in the 1961 film remains, to this day, one of only two Latinas to win an Oscar for acting. Though this distinction has grown bitter with time, it’s still a thrill to watch her “sing of assimilation while dancing its undoing,” in the words of the performance studies scholar Deborah Paredez. But whatever pleasure and power Puerto_Ricans have extracted from “West Side Story” have been extracted against the odds.
The show’s creators didn’t know, or didn’t seem to care to know, much about their own material. The lyricist Stephen Sondheim at first expressed doubts about his fitness for the project: “I’ve never been that poor and I’ve never even met a Puerto_Rican.” The initial concept, an adaptation of “Romeo and Juliet” recast with teenage street gangs, didn’t involve Puerto_Ricans at all. The artists toyed with a number of ethnic possibilities — Jewish people? Mexicans? — before settling on the version we know now.
In the words of Leonard Bernstein, the show’s composer, “the Puerto_Rican thing had just begun to explode.” For Mr. Bernstein, that “thing” was a fortuitous coincidence for his formal experiment, but in the real world, it was an enormous postwar migration from the island that had “nearly doubled” New York City’s Puerto_Rican population in just two years, as the scholar Lorrin Thomas notes in her book “Puerto_Rican Citizen.”
Right from the beginning, these recent arrivals didn’t like what they saw on Broadway. New York’s most widely circulated Spanish-language newspaper at the time, La Prensa, called for a picket at the premiere, and the Puerto_Rican journalist and labor organizer Jesús Colón lamented that the show was “superficial and sentimental” and “always out of context with the real history, culture, and traditions of my people.” In subsequent decades, this tradition of protest and critique has only grown richer and more collectively exasperated.
Mr. Bernstein’s music and Jerome Robbins’s choreography are often cited as the musical’s redeeming features by its liberal defenders; a critical Los Angeles Times review of the 2009 Broadway revival nonetheless praised the “extraordinary variety and operatic fullness” of the score and the “ecstasy” of the dance numbers. But I’ve always been baffled by how the musical’s creators squandered the opportunity to engage the genius of Afro-Caribbean polyrhythms. The gym scene “mambo” is not, rhythmically, a mambo, and the famous rooftop number “America” has the Sharks dancing a Spanish-from-Spain paso doble mishmashed with whitewashed showbiz jazz.
When performers like Ms. Moreno succeed in conveying distinctively Nuyorican ways of moving, they seem to strain to do so under inhospitable conditions. In theory, “West Side Story” should have something to say about the experience of assimilation. But in practice, the musical demands assimilation from its Puerto_Rican performers, then capitalizes on the glorious virtuosity of their capacity to resist it.
Directors of more recent productions have made an effort to adapt “West Side Story” into something culturally relevant and a bit more politically correct. The 1980 revival was the first to cast a Puerto_Rican performer as Maria, and the 2009 revival enlisted Lin-Manuel Miranda to render some of the dialogue bilingually. In the latest Broadway staging, Mr. van Hove dutifully follows their lead: The Sharks are played by Latinx performers, and there are snatches of urban Spanish patter between songs. The bodega looks like a real bodega.
And notably, the choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker leaves behind the soaring lines of Jerome Robbins’s original numbers in favor of loose, feral syncopations developed in collaboration with the dancers themselves. Of course, there’s only so much Latin rhythm they can bring to the musical while maintaining a working relationship with Leonard Bernstein’s score — perhaps an object lesson in the limits of reform, whether aesthetic or political.
Where Mr. van Hove diverges from previous stagings is in doubling down on the plot’s brutality. I still can’t shake the chill I felt watching the Jets attempt to gang-rape Anita in the show’s third act. It’s magnified on a giant screen onstage, captured by one of the Jets on his cellphone camera. The omnipresence of screens in this production should remind us how easy it has always been to reproduce, revive and restage scenes of spectacular violence. Yet I’m not sure how deeply Mr. van Hove understands the implications of his own choices here.
According to Scott Rudin, one of the show’s producers, Mr. van Hove “doesn’t direct revivals like they’re revivals, because to him, they’re not.” Mr. van Hove may have “no iconic relationship” to “West Side Story,” so he may not feel the oppressive repetitions of the history of violence against brown women bearing down on his body. But for many of us, it’s the umpteenth time we’ve seen Anita assaulted for dramatic effect, each time under the guise of greater authenticity.
This production also renders the Jets as a multiracial gang, concocting a fantasy world in which bigoted whites form an alliance with African-Americans against Puerto_Rican migrants — a bid, in Ms. De Keersmaeker’s words, “for inclusion of the American population today.” But it’s unlikely black New Yorkers would seek (or find) security among white Americans rather than among their Caribbean, Middle Eastern and Central American neighbors. Mr. van Hove’s casting misrepresents the real solidarities that form at the margins of U.S. citizenship — and perhaps more dangerously, shifts our focus away from the enduring problem of white supremacist violence. “Inclusion” here is code for willful colorblindness.
Mr. van Hove and Ms. De Keersmaeker are Belgian; we’ll give them that excuse. But in 2020, most Americans — and certainly all New Yorkers — in the audience have “met a Puerto_Rican” and should theoretically know more about our relationship to one another than “West Side Story” can reveal.
The United States has a compulsion when it comes to “West Side Story,” restaging, again and again, the primal scene of the colony’s incursion into American consciousness, the midcentury’s “gran migración” of Puerto_Ricans to New York City. Never mind all that has transpired since then: salsa, hip-hop, the Young Lords, the movement to demilitarize Vieques, Hurricane Maria, #RickyRenuncia, the new “gran migración” not to New York but to points south — especially Orlando, Fla., where the Pulse club massacre happened on Latin Night.
Mr. Bernstein’s daughter, Jamie, celebrated this latest Broadway revival as “more timely now than ever” given “the story line involving the mistreatment” of Puerto_Rican migrants. But the numbing persistence of such “mistreatment” — which has as much to do with colonial geopolitics as with garden-variety anti-black and anti-immigrant racism — is not necessarily a testament to the musical’s insight. And these continuous revivals reinforce America’s colonizing power to determine who Puerto_Ricans get to be.
It might be nice for some to think that culture is not a zero-sum game, that we can sustain an outdated musical as a nostalgic artifact without precluding new narratives, which ultimately require new distributions of power. In a feature for The New York Times Magazine, Sasha Weiss wondered whether this current generation of Latinx dancers “will one day insist on staging ‘West Side Story’ for themselves.”
I think of them when I go to my dance class at La Goyco, a school in Santurce, San Juan, that was abandoned because of recent austerity cuts but reclaimed by activists as a community center — the only place I could charge my laptop to write this Op-Ed in the blackouts after the island’s recent earthquakes. In the Afro-Puerto_Rican musical tradition known as bomba, the dancers are the ones who tell the drum what to do. They are the directors of their own performance.
Maybe the next generation of dancers won’t want to adapt “West Side Story” anymore. Maybe what we want is independence, to shine within a tradition we’ve authored ourselves. I’m not above quoting Anita in my advice to the American entertainment industry and its many captive audiences: “Forget that boy, and find another.”"

On ‘Oprah’s Book Club,’ ‘American Dirt’ Author Faces Criticism
By Concepción de León

When Oprah Winfrey selected “American Dirt” by Jeanine Cummins as her January book club pick, the novel seemed poised to be one of the year’s major releases. It follows a mother and son fleeing Mexico for the United States to escape cartel violence and was described by its publisher as a modern-day version of “The Grapes of Wrath.”
But the conversation surrounding the book quickly turned sour. After a scathing review by the writer Myriam Gurba, who said it relied on racist stereotypes, other Latinx writers and community members expressed similar criticism. “American Dirt” became a best seller, but its publisher, Flatiron, canceled a planned book tour and more than 100 writers signed an open letter asking Winfrey to reconsider her pick.
Winfrey decided instead to “lean in” to the conversation, she said. In an episode of her Apple TV Plus series, “Oprah’s Book Club,” that became available on Friday, she addressed the book, her decision to feature it and the backlash to both.
The two-part episode features Cummins in conversation with Winfrey, but in a departure from most “Oprah’s Book Club” episodes, it includes three Latina writers critical of the book: Julissa Arce, an activist and author of “My (Underground) American Dream”; Esther Cepeda, a syndicated Washington Post columnist; and Reyna Grande, who has written several books about her experience crossing the border, including the memoir “The Distance Between Us.”
Opening the show, Winfrey explained why she chose the book and defended the right of Cummins, who isn’t Mexican, to write it. “I fundamentally, fundamentally believe in the right of anyone to use their imagination and their skills to tell stories and to empathize with another story,” Winfrey said.
When asked whether she anticipated the negative reaction to it, Cummins said, “I definitely worried about this moment, about being called to account for having written the book.”
She said she regretted a widely criticized line in the book’s author’s note, in which she wrote that she wished someone “slightly browner” had written the story. Talking with Winfrey, Cummins called it a “clumsy phrase,” adding that it was “indicative of my own sort of grappling with my identity in these pages.”
Cummins also drew criticism for writing about her husband’s immigration to the U.S. from Ireland without noting his ethnicity. During the episode, she said his background was “absolutely relevant in why I was drawn to writing about immigration issues, and I felt like it was a thing that I wanted to mention,” but said she regretted conflating her husband’s experience with that of asylum seekers at the Mexico-U.S. border.
When Arce, Cepeda and Grande joined the discussion, they criticized the book as well as the broader publishing industry and its treatment of Latinx writers.
Reading “American Dirt,” “I felt hurt and I felt undervalued,” Grande said, “because the publishing industry does not have the same attitude with our immigrant stories as they did with your story.” The books by Latinx writers that are published, she said, are “to little fanfare.”
Cepeda said that writers of color are often expected to write solely about issues such as race and immigration, while white writers have much more liberty. “We have lots of other stories to tell than immigration stories,” she said.
Don Weisberg, the president of Macmillan, which operates Flatiron, and Amy Einhorn, the editor who acquired “American Dirt,” were in the audience. Weisberg said that increasing diversity in the company was a priority and that it had hired strategists to help. “Did those people suggest you hire more Latinos?” asked Cepeda.
“It sounds simple, but it’s not simple,” Weisberg said, adding that change was required on all levels at the company.
Despite the criticism of “American Dirt,” the book has been a commercial success, spending six weeks on the New York Times best-seller list for combined print and e-book fiction and selling nearly 200,000 copies, according to NPD Book Scan. Being named a book club pick by Winfrey continues to be a boon for writers and typically all but ensures their work will land on the best-seller list.
But after the backlash to her selection of “American Dirt,” Winfrey recently dropped her March pick, “My Dark Vanessa.” Winfrey, through a spokeswoman, declined to say why, but after the taping of the “Oprah's Book Club” episode she told The Associated Press, “I’m not going to play it safer, but I’m not going to wade into water if I don’t have to.”
Missing from the conversation released Friday was Gurba, one of the first critics of “American Dirt.” Arce pointed out her absence at one point, saying she wished Gurba was there to speak for herself.
In a phone interview on Friday, Gurba said she was disappointed that Winfrey kept the book as her pick. “The book didn’t become problematic when the criticism was communicated to her, the book was problematic when she read it,” Gurba said. “I’m disappointed that she doesn’t want to engage privately regarding the issues raised by critics.”
She, along with the writers Roberto Lovato and David Bowles, founded the media campaign #DignidadLiteraria amid the fallout over “American Dirt” and met with Flatiron and Macmillan last month to discuss diversity at the company.
“We’re cautiously optimistic,” Lovato said. But to Gurba, “the commitment that they made is very vague,” she said, “and until they put real meat in that commitment, I’m not going to put much stock in it.”
In a report released this week, Flatiron’s president, Bob Miller, said the company had taken steps to address its lack of diversity, including hiring a new H.R. employee focused on recruitment from underrepresented groups and creating a database of “authenticity readers” for use on future titles. Miller also said that Flatiron is considering fellowships and mentoring programs for Latinx writers, adding, “Our hope is to continue to expand our outreach efforts in other underrepresented communities as well.”"

Why Young Latinx Voters Rallied Behind Sanders
By Arthur D. Soto-Vásquez

Bernie Sanders’s message has resonated among young people, particularly younger Latinx voters. In California, where they make up about a third of the constituency, Latinx voters under 30 overwhelmingly supported Mr. Sanders. That electorate helped his campaign carry enough delegates in California and Texas to keep the nomination contest within 100 delegates after the Super Tuesday contests. Though he didn’t win Michigan, they also backed him there. So why are young Latinx voters rallying behind Mr. Sanders?
The answer is not very complicated: His campaign organized and prioritized outreach to Latinx communities.
In the past, the Democratic Party believed immigration to be the central issue that mobilized Latinx voters. And yet, a poll conducted in March by Univision and the Latino Community Foundation found that like most Americans, Latinx voters in California considered health care and the economy to be top policy issues. While Mr. Sanders has a comprehensive and progressive immigration plan, he has not made it the focal point of his campaign. Instead he has centered his debates and messaging on issues like health care, the economy and jobs.
Campaigns that have historically tried to target Latinx voters have usually relied on Spanish-language media, including some comically translated campaign websites. But audiences are usually older and nonvoters. The Latinx population in the United States is characterized by its youth — 30 years old on average. The Sanders campaign has figured out that to mobilize a mass of Latinx voters, they needed to target the youth. Older Latinx voters may come along anyway after their children persuade them — there is empirical research that Latinx youth often serve as “news interpreters” and information brokers for their parents.
In the book “Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials,” Malcolm Harris laid out how millennials have come of age in an economy that requires a large accumulation of debt to earn a higher-education credential, to enter a job market concentrated in cities with high rent that is characterized by insecurity and low wages. These trends are even more pressing for younger Latinx voters, who have less family wealth to rely on than their white peers.
Mr. Sanders’s effective ground organization, led by the strategist Chuck Rocha, has taken a multimedia approach to engage with Latinx voters, including TV advertisements, digital media and mailers, along with canvassing. In Iowa, a state with a predominantly white population, the campaign sought the support of Latinx voters and those efforts paid off. Mr. Sanders won over 96 percent of their vote at four Spanish-language satellite caucus sites, earning crucial state delegates along the way that narrowed the close election. The victory was a product of effective organizing.
In Laredo, Texas, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border typical of places where Mr. Sanders has high support, I saw only two presidential campaigns on the ground — those of Michael Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders. While the Bloomberg campaign mostly relied on paid canvassers, the Sanders campaign held a community canvass of volunteers on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. In Laredo, Mr. Sanders won with 35 percent of the vote, while Mr. Bloomberg came in second. Mr. Sanders also carried El Paso, the Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio and Austin — all cities in Texas with large Latinx populations.
The Latinx electorate does not vote as a bloc, despite the hopes of marketers and political parties. National-origin, regional, age and class differences matter. The Latinx voters in California and Texas who back Mr. Sanders are mostly Mexican-American. His message will probably not translate in places like Florida, which has a significant Cuban and Venezuelan population.
But his campaign’s ability to rally Latinx voters is noteworthy. As I write in my book “Mobilizing the U.S. Latinx Vote,: Media, Identity, and Politics,” the center-left has viewed the Latinx vote as the key to an electoral majority and struggled to get it out to vote since at least 2000. Regardless of who the Democratic nominee will be, mobilizing these voters will be a key to victory in 2020. Democrats should avoid the flawed assumption that running against Mr. Trump will be enough to get them out. The Trump campaign is even making inroads among Latinx voters — especially evangelicals in states like Florida and Georgia.
A young and Latinx voter surge in the general election campaign could be vital to turning states like Arizona and Texas into competitive states. The 2020 Democratic nominee should take note of what worked in turning out Latinx voters in the primary and aim to replicate that success in the general election."

How Did Biden and Sanders Do in the Debate? Experts Weigh In

“Joe Biden’s answer to the question on how he will get the support of Latinx voters, who have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders, was inadequate. Was it me or did it sound like he didn’t care that Latinx voters aren’t voting for him?” — Cristina Jiménez, co-founder and executive director of United We Dream"

For Many Immigrants, an Even Greater Risk
By Ayendy Bonifacio

I call my mother every afternoon to check in on her. She lives in a three-story Section 8 building in East New York, Brooklyn, in the apartment my siblings and I grew up in. Three of her neighbors died from Covid-19 in the last two weeks, and more than half of the families in her 12-unit building are sick. Through the walls she could hear the wails of the family who lost a loved one to the virus next door: “Don’t go! Please don’t leave us!” Another neighbor on the second floor, a middle-aged Ecuadorean man who lived with his elderly mother, died the day before Easter. The worst part, she said, is not being able to pay her respects in person, to say goodbye to the neighbors that over the years have become her family. I feel my stomach turn with guilt.
As a professor of English, I am among the New Yorkers who are able to work from home. But I am the exception in my family. My mother cleans apartments in Manhattan for a living. Her clients have all canceled, but she isn’t getting paid time off or a severance package. She is draining all of her savings, money she had hoped to put toward her first house, to pay rent and utilities.
She worries about my uncle, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn for 17 days; she worries about her church friends, many of whom have tested positive for the virus; she worries about our family in the Dominican_Republic, some of whom are also infected. Most of all, she worries about my younger brother, who works at a small family-owned grocery store in Harlem, restocking shelves, managing the deli counter and preparing sandwiches for customers.
My younger brother commutes to work every day from East New York, where he lives in a cramped two-bedroom apartment with his 3-year-old son, pregnant wife and in-laws. He and his co-workers wear masks and gloves to protect themselves and the customers. Still, he fears he could get sick or, worse, bring the virus home to his family. “People at my job are getting sick; they know what symptoms to look for — a fever and a cough — so they take time off,” he told me. Many of them are undocumented and won’t risk going to the doctor. They are afraid of being deported.
On March 18, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that they would temporarily halt deportation enforcement across the country, except for efforts to deport foreign nationals who have committed crimes or who pose a threat to public safety. But that same day, I.C.E. continued to make arrests in some of the regions hardest hit by the virus, including California and New York.
There are over two million Latinx people in New York City, many of them members of immigrant families like mine, who work in businesses considered “essential.” Grocery store workers, housekeepers, delivery workers, immigrant owners of small businesses, cabdrivers and undocumented workers worry not only about their immigration status but also a basic income to survive. For them, social distancing is a luxury they simply can’t afford.
Some 30 percent of Americans have jobs that allow them to work from home. This number shrinks dramatically for black and Latinx people, and, especially, immigrants. Among the U.S. work force, just 16 percent of Latinx workers and 18 percent of black Americans can work from home, while roughly 30 percent of whites and 37 percent of Asian-Americans can.
The telework gap is one way the pandemic underscores wealth and educational disparities in this country. My brother and thousands of other essential workers risk their well-being working in places where they regularly meet hundreds of potential carriers of the coronavirus. They face unprecedented legal, health and financial risks that will linger far longer than this pandemic.
I reflect on the socioeconomic divide within my own family. Immigrants like my brother and mother have no choice but to go to work and risk getting sick, or stay home without pay. To escape the clamor of bad news, my mother reads the Bible and plays her guitar. She was cleaning the hallways in the building, until I begged her to stop for her safety. But when we spoke last, she confessed that she’s been struggling to keep her spirits up. I can only say, Perdóname, mami. I wish there were more I could do."

Will We Face Depression-Era Job Losses? Let’s Not Find Out
By Angela Glover Blackwell and Darrick Hamilton

On Friday, the Labor Department announced that over 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7 percent. This level of devastation has not been reached since the Great Depression. With more than one in four companies shuttered to minimize the pandemic’s death toll and at least 30 million workers seeking unemployment benefits, we are in the throes of an unprecedented jobs crisis.
Just like the health crisis, economic fallout is hitting black and brown communities particularly hard. Far more black, Latinx, and Native American households are financially impacted or severely harmed by the coronavirus than white households. People of color make up an outsized share of the essential workers — grocery store clerks, bus drivers, janitors and home care workers — who risk exposure to the virus while earning low wages with few benefits.
While Congress has taken some important steps to provide relief, more must be done to keep people safe, prevent job losses and maintain incomes. We face a recession with the potential for Depression-era job losses, and we know from experience that black and brown workers bear the greatest risk of long-term economic setbacks. To ensure an inclusive recovery and a more resilient future, Congress needs to enact a federal job guarantee: a public option for a job with living wages and full benefits on projects that meet long-neglected community needs.
This idea is not new. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act — introduced in the 1970s by Senator Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Representative Augustus Hawkins, a Democrat from California — proposed employment guarantees. The original bill allowed citizens to sue the government if they couldn’t find a job. A version of federal job protections has been percolating for years. In 2018, three Democratic senators — Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont — approved of the idea. Hundreds of scholars, leaders and organizations working for racial, economic and environmental justice have signed on to a Jobs for All pledge calling for a federal guarantee.
The coronavirus exposes the extreme vulnerability of a system that actively produces inequality. A job guarantee is a powerful solution that would not only address urgent needs but also bend our economy toward racial and economic justice.
As Pavlina Tcherneva, an economist at Bard College, described, some of these guaranteed jobs could be in disaster preparation and monitoring. We could hire workers to conduct the community-based testing, monitoring and contract tracing necessary to contain the virus and safely reopen the economy. Workers would be equipped with proper personal protective equipment, and could have access to child care provided through the program. Employment (rather than unemployment) offices across the country could identify and fill shortages of ventilators and masks.
The program would be funded by the federal government and administered locally, with community input to identify projects that address long-term physical and care infrastructure needs. Communities could implement energy efficiency retrofits and environmental restoration efforts to fight climate change. They could hire teacher’s assistants, child care providers and elder care aides to support our youth and seniors. And they could remediate brownfields and create new public art.
States and cities could also implement larger-scale projects, for example laying municipal broadband networks that plug disconnected communities into the modern economy — a divide made visible as public schools scrambled to implement distance learning.
By ensuring that everyone can have not just any job, but a good job with dignified wages, benefits, health care, safe working conditions and full worker rights, a job guarantee would deliver long-needed worker reforms. It would tackle poverty by providing a viable alternative for the 40 percent of workers who earn less than $15 per hour. And it would reduce racial employment disparities by guaranteeing good jobs for everyone, including black, Latinx and Native American workers who face hiring discrimination and are disproportionately relegated to low-wage jobs.
A federal commitment to universal employment has deep roots in the New Deal and the civil rights movement. The Works Progress Administration employed 8.5 million people over eight years, building infrastructure that supported and powered the nation over the next century. In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for an Economic Bill of Rights, beginning with the right to employment. Martin Luther King, Jr., pushed for guaranteed jobs in his final years and Coretta Scott King led a grass-roots movement championing it.
An updated version of Roosevelt’s vision would increase bargaining power and expand the social safety net for all workers. By hiring workers at the beginning of a downturn, a permanent job guarantee would operate as an automatic stabilizer in perpetuity, maintaining consumer spending and protecting us from recessions — making our economy more resilient as well as more inclusive.
This time last year, no one would have predicted that a global pandemic would bring us to the brink of economic collapse. But we can predict with certainty that Covid-19 will not be our last economic shock. A job guarantee can mitigate this harm and usher in a more just and equitable economic future."

‘Finish the Fight’: A Special Digital Theater Performance Celebrates 100 Years of Women’s Right to Vote
By The New York Times

“Finish the Fight” premiered on Aug. 18, 2020 — the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment. A recording of the performance is available to stream for free.
They were tireless organizers. Tenacious fighters. And political geniuses. They were Black and Latinx. Indigenous and immigrant. Together, they helped women win the right to vote and laid the cornerstone for gender equality in the United States. Yet their stories are not as well known as they should be.
The New York Times commissioned and produced “Finish the Fight,” a digital play in which the acclaimed playwright Ming Peiffer (“Usual Girls”), the 2020 Obie-winning director Whitney White (“Our Dear Dead Drug Lord,” “What to Send Up When It Goes Down”) and a cast of celebrated actresses bring to theatrical life the biographies of lesser-known activists who helped to win voting rights for women. The play adapts the book “Finish the Fight!: The Brave and Revolutionary Women Who Fought for the Right to Vote,” written by Veronica Chambers, a Times senior editor, and the Times journalists Jennifer Schuessler, Amisha Padnani, Jennifer Harlan, Sandra E. Garcia and Vivian Wang.
This theatrical retelling goes beyond familiar figures like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to shine light on the Black, Asian, Latinx, Native American and queer women who were at the forefront of the suffrage movement in the United States. Though the play includes invented scenes and imagined conversations among five women — the events of their lives, and their accomplishments, are real.
In this world premiere, Leah Lewis (“The Half of It,” “Nancy Drew”) plays Mabel Ping-Hua Lee, a Chinese suffragist; Q’orianka Kilcher (“The Alienist”) portrays Zitkála-Šá, a Yankton Sioux writer, artist, educator and activist; Chelsea Rendon (“Shameless,” “Vida”) plays Jovita Idár, a journalist and activist who fought on behalf of Mexican-Americans and women; and Zora Howard (“Premature”) plays Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, an abolitionist who helped to establish the National Association of Colored Women and was the first African-American to have a short story published in the United States. The Broadway actress Harriett D. Foy plays Mary McLeod Bethune, the influential activist for women’s rights and civil rights.
“The way we talk about suffrage needs attention,” Kate Clarke Lemay, a historian and curator at the National Portrait Gallery, has said. “It is so often described in a way that makes it seem kind of dowdy and dour — whereas in fact it is exciting and radical. Women staged one of the longest social reform movements in the history of the United States. This is not a boring history of nagging spinsters; it is a badass history of revolution staged by political geniuses. I think that because they were women, people have hesitated to credit them as such.”
“Finish the Fight” reminds us what powerhouses the women of the suffrage movement truly were."

The Voices Missing From the Convention

The Democratic National Convention featured not only a slate of the party’s heavyweights, but also several prominent Republicans. Missing from the lineup? Prominent progressive Latinos.
Julián Castro, the only Latino to run for president in 2020 and who delivered a keynote speech at the 2012 convention, wasn’t given any speaking time. And don’t tell me that giving Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising superstar and arguably the most effective political communicator, about 90 seconds of airtime was enough. She had less time to speak than a former Republican governor who got nearly 4 minutes. The two other Latino politicians who had major speaking slots — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada — were moderates with lower profiles.
Rather than growing the electorate, which is how Democrats will win in November and beyond, it seems as though they are reaching out to Republican voters. This sends a terrible message to the Latino voters they need to win in November.
There are a record-breaking 23 million naturalized citizens eligible to vote this November, 34 percent of whom are Latino. I became a citizen last year, and I will be voting for the first time in a presidential election this November after many years of being undocumented. Yet, Joe Biden continues to have an enthusiasm problem with Latinos. A PBS NewsHour-NPR-Marist poll showed Mr. Biden underperforming: Only 59 percent of Latinos said they’d vote for him over Donald Trump, compared with the 66 percent who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The Biden campaign has tried to close its Latino enthusiasm gap by releasing a policy plan to address economic inequality and empower Latinos. The plan includes a commitment to ensuring that immigrants have access to free Covid-19 testing, treatment and an eventual vaccine. It also includes a reinstatement of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and limiting the use of programs that force local law enforcement to take on the role of immigration enforcement.
But, there’s much that is lacking. One glaring omission is Medicare for All. The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fact that millions of immigrants live without health insurance and have suffered disproportionately in recent months. Access to affordable health care was a top issue for Latinx voters who sided with Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. Mr. Biden has refused to endorse Medicare for All — a popular solution to our nation’s health care catastrophe that would serve all people, including undocumented immigrants.
Mr. Biden isn’t doing enough to move the people he needs to persuade to vote for him. Just a few weeks ago, 90 field organizers for the Florida Democratic Party signed an internal letter saying the Biden campaign has no “fully actionable field plan,” and is “suppressing the Hispanic vote” in Central Florida. These are significant missteps that the Biden campaign should fix quickly.
Mr. Biden should be giving frequent speeches, releasing weekly ads on TV and radio and sharing regular social media content aimed at immigrants and Latinx communities. He must address our pain and suffering. We’ve had to endure Donald Trump throwing children in cages, trying to dismantle DACA, separating our families, terrorizing our communities with immigration enforcement agents and treating immigrant workers as disposable during the pandemic.
But we don’t want watered down deportation policies. We want him to stop deportations in his first 100 days and eliminate for-profit detention facilities. We want the Biden administration to push Congress to defund ICE and C.B.P. We want him to reunite families that have been separated by wrongful deportations and asylum denials. Protecting DACA is the floor, not the ceiling.
After all, the immigrant justice movement has turned public opinion against Donald Trump’s deportation force. More Americans today than ever before dislike ICE. A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found ICE was the only agency asked about in the survey viewed more negatively (54 percent) than positively (42 percent). Only 19 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners view the agency favorably.
Electoral coalitions are about addition, not subtraction. The math is straightforward. Mr. Biden can persuade a larger number of voters by making it clear that, if elected, immigrants will have reason to be optimistic about the future, despite the horrors of the present.
This pro-immigrant version of Mr. Biden has yet to emerge. The best time for that version to arrive is right now. It would make Mr. Biden a much more compelling presidential candidate, one who could drive an enormous number of voters to the polls and defeat Donald Trump in a landslide — and enable us to rebuild the country from the ground up."

Protesting Her Own Employer
By Asthaa Chaturvedi, Stella Tan and Clare Toeniskoetter

“As a Black woman who works at Adidas, my experiences have never been business as usual.”
Julia Bond, an assistant apparel designer at the sportswear giant, says she had resigned herself to experiencing and witnessing racism at work — until she saw the George Floyd video.
Today, we speak to Ms. Bond, a woman who has brought the global racial reckoning to the company’s front door.
Wanting more than just policies and programs, she has been protesting in front of the company’s Portland headquarters every day since June, awaiting an apology from leadership and an admission that they have enabled racism and discrimination.

Adidas has made a number of pledges to diversify its work force. However, Black employees want more: an admission that the company’s leadership has enabled racism and an apology.
From Facebook’s pledge to double the number of Black and Latinx employees by 2023 to YouTube creating a $100 million fund for Black creators, organizations across the U.S. have committed to redressing racial imbalance."

Kristin Urquiza, whose father died of Covid-19, turned grief into activism at the convention
By Jennifer Medina

One of the most memorable speakers of the first night of the Democratic National Convention was a woman whom many voters had never heard of: Kristin Urquiza, whose father, a supporter of President Trump’s, died of the coronavirus in Phoenix in June, not long after Arizona lifted many of its stay-at-home restrictions.
“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,” she said during the convention. “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump — and for that he paid with his life.”
In May, Ms. Urquiza, 39, graduated with a master’s degree in public policy from the University of California, Berkeley, and had planned to continue her work with international environmental policy. But the death of her father, Mark Anthony Urquiza, has prompted her to turn her focus on the impact of the pandemic in the United States.
Already, her words are being featured in two political advertisements targeting voters in several swing states. The New York Times spoke with her about her family’s politics and what she planned to do in the weeks leading up to the presidential election.
The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
You spoke about your father’s vote for Mr. Trump — how much did the two of you discuss politics?
He was a Republican for most of his life. I just learned recently that when my parents got married, my mom was a registered Republican and he was a Democrat, but he said, “Well, I’ll be a Republican so we don’t cancel each other out.” I think my dad over time became very loyal to the party. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He liked that he was a businessman. He thought that he would bring a fresh perspective to his position.
When he was in this hospital, we ended up talking about politics. I asked him, “What do you think now?” He told me that he felt sideswiped and betrayed by what was happening. I didn’t have the heart to dig in further, but there was a part of me that wanted to. I didn’t want him to feel like he was doing something wrong. My dad was following what he was told by people who are supposed to be leaders.
How did you make the decision to turn grief into advocacy?
I saw people in the neighborhood I grew up in waiting in line for hours for [Covid] tests in 107-degree heat — predominantly immigrants, predominantly Latinx. If I didn’t speak out, I didn’t know who would.
Governor [Doug] Ducey was lock step with Trump on reopening quickly — that caused a spike across the country. I was not comfortable to have him with blood on his hands without being open about that.So by leaning into the advocacy, I couldn’t save my dad’s life, but I could potentially have that sort of higher purpose."

New Initiative Will Grant $156 Million to Arts Groups Run by People of Color
By Colin Moynihan

Some of the nation’s most prominent philanthropists and foundations announced plans on Thursday to donate more than $156 million to help arts organizations run by people of color recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The initiative, called America’s Cultural Treasures, includes national and regional components and was conceived by Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, and those who work for the foundation’s Creativity and Free Expression program.
It is meant to bring greater resources and recognition to what the foundation described as “Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous” organizations representing the heritage of people who “have been historically marginalized, underfunded and underrepresented in the narrative of American culture.”
News of the initiative was first reported by The Washington Post.
The national component includes $50 million from the Ford Foundation and additional money from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Abrams Foundation, the Alice L. Walton Foundation, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, and Tom and Lisa Blumenthal. It will provide $81 million in operational and general support funds to 20 organizations that are “significant national anchors for artistic and cultural diversity in America,” the Ford Foundation said.
National grants will range from $1 million to $6 million each. Recipients include the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage; the Apollo Theater in New York City; the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn, Mich.; the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles; and the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago.
“These organizations represent the very highest ideals of artistic excellence and are truly America’s cultural treasures,” Mr. Walker said in a statement. “We hope that other arts philanthropists and corporations will join in increasing support to the many cultural organizations that reflect our nation’s rich and diverse history.”
Cultural institutions across the country have suffered as a result of the pandemic, with some of the biggest and best known dismissing employees and slashing programming as revenue has plummeted. Economists and fund-raising experts believe that charitable giving will likely drop more than it did during the 2008 recession and that recovery will probably take longer, the Ford Foundation said.
Arts organizations led by and serving people of color, which have historically been underfunded, are at increased risk of having to permanently close, the foundation added.
The Ford Foundation also contributed $35 million to the regional initiative, in which multiyear grants will be issued to cultural groups of color with “exceptional regional or local significance.”
Other foundations, including the Getty Foundation, the Heinz Endowments, the William Penn Foundation and the John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation will provide matching funds for those grants. It is expected that those grant recipients will be announced in early 2021.
The $85 million contribution from the Ford Foundation to the initiative comes from an unusual source: a bond offering earlier this year, amid economic upheaval, in which Ford raised $1 billion so that the organization could substantially increase the amount of money it distributes."

Honoring Latinx Art, Personal and Political
By Holland Cotter

The marketing of modern and contemporary art from Latin America is one of the cultural success stories of the globalist decades. What was once a niche interest has gradually been gaining a solid, if still limited, presence in some of our big North American museums.
Exactly the opposite is true of Latino art, now often referred to by the gender-neutral name Latinx in the cultural world, and loosely defined as work made by artists of Latin American birth or descent but who live primarily in the United States. Apart from the work of a few stars — notably Jean-Michel Basquiat — Latinx art has scant institutional support or auction clout.
Such lack of attention is dictated by the politics of class, economics and race. And resistance to this reality is always percolating somewhere, which is the basic story told at El Museo del Barrio by the impassioned archival exhibition, “Taller Boricua: A Political Print Shop in New York.”
El Taller Boricua, which also officially called itself the Puerto_Rican Workshop, opened in the barrio of East Harlem 50 years ago, in 1970, a year after El Museo debuted in the same neighborhood. Both were artist-run, community-serving initiatives housed in low-rent quarters. With overlapping membership, and inspired by the example of the Black Power movement, both were responses to the experiences faced by brown-skinned, working-class immigrants to the United States.
The workshop’s original members — Marcos Dimas, Adrián García, Manuel “Neco” Otero, Martín Rubio and Armando Soto — were art-school-trained Puerto_Rican artists living in New York City.
Their goals in organizing the workshop were both idealistic and pragmatic. They wanted to establish a collectively run center for art production and teaching in a city that excluded artists of color from its elite institutions. And they wanted to make art shaped by the cultural traditions — including African, Hispanic, Indigenous Caribbean — that contributed to Latinx identities.
In short, they approached art as politically instrumental and found ways to put it into popular circulation. They took the role of artist and activist to be inseparable. Although the range of subjects Taller artists tackled was broad, revolution was the common theme.
That theme is detailed, loud and clear, at the start of the show in a 1973 painting by Carlos Osorio that embeds the word “Revolución” in a visual conflagration of red and yellow pigment. Mr. Osorio (1927-1984) was one of the earliest and oldest artists to join Taller Boricua and El Museo in their start-up years; Rafael Tufiño (1922-2008) was another.
Born in Brooklyn, he grew up in Puerto Rico and studied art in Mexico, returning to New York in the 1960s. Like Mr. Osorio, he was a painter, but it was his fine-grained, socialist realist-style prints of laborers and peasants that became influential within the East Harlem art community.
Prints were an ideal communicative tool. Cheap to produce in unlimited numbers, easy to distribute, and available to everyone in the form of posters, fliers and newsletters, they were adaptable to a wide range of ideological persuasion and promotion, as the show suggests.
Heroes are commemorated, as in Mr. Tufiño’s 1970 linocut portrait of Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965), the visionary president of the Puerto_Rican Nationalist Party, who served repeated prison terms battling United States control of the island. Mr. Dimas contributes a striking quadruple image of another independence fighter, Lolita Lebrón, who spent 25 years in a federal prison after participating in a 1954 armed attack on the Capitol building in Washington.
And from Fernando Salicrup (1946-2015) — an early Taller Boricua artist and eventually, with Mr. Dimas, the workshop’s director — comes a tender, luminous lithographic image of Julia de Burgos, a Puerto_Rican born poet and activist who died an alcoholic in an East Harlem hospital in 1953. (El Taller continues to maintain an exhibition gallery in Barrio art center named for her.)
If these prints package politics in a language of praise, others give a voice to protest. When, in 1970, Julio Roldan, a member of the militant Young Lords — the Latino equivalent of the Black Panthers — was found hanged in his cell in the Tombs, described by the police as a suicide, the Puerto_Rican community hit the streets and artists papered the city with accusatory broadsides. They would do so again four years later when a Taller Boricua artist, Martín Pérez, known as Tito, died in police custody, also allegedly by his own hand.
Prints were a way to call a community together for militant action, but also for festivities. And it is promised pleasures we find in a group of event posters designed by the New York-born artist Manuel Vega, known as Manny. Rich in color, rococo in detail, they advertise outdoor spectacles like the Three Kings Day parade, still presented annually by El Museo, and smaller, semipublic ones like the rooftop “under the stars” dances organized to benefit El Taller.
Interaction between the two institutions in the early years, though not without conflicts, was close, and this made practical sense. Few members of Taller Boricua were exclusively printmakers; most were primarily painters and sculptors. Even if they weren’t gearing their nonprint work to display in conventional museums, a museum was the logical place for it. The exhibition’s final gallery, with its installation of large-scale objects by three originating Taller members — Nitza Tufiño, Jorge Soto Sánchez, and Mr. Dimas — makes this clear.
Ms. Tufiño, the daughter of Rafael Tufiño, extends traditional printmaking in a beautiful 1979 series of abstract silk-screens sewn with panels of colored thread. She is also a painter and muralist who makes imaginative use of themes from ancient Indigenous Caribbean culture, as in a large 1972 picture done in acrylic and charcoal called “Pareja Taina” (“Taino Couple”).
This painting, like much of the work in the show, is now in El Museo’s permanent collection. So are several large-scale assemblage reliefs by Mr. Dimas and Mr. Soto Sánchez (1947-1987), objects that more or less reverse the trajectory of popular prints. Where prints were often made for display in the street, the reliefs brought the street — barrio street refuse, that is — into the studio, where the artists attached it to canvases. In both cases, in different ways, the divide between art and life was breached.
It was smart of the show’s organizers — Rodrigo Moura, El Museo’s chief curator, and Noel Valentin, its permanent collection manager — to have added these highly personal mix-media objects — Mr. Soto Sánchez calls one of his reliefs “Self-Portrait” — and take the show beyond its “political print shop” title.
No doubt one reason Latinx art remains, as a category, unalluring to the market is that it is perceived as being both too narrow and too broad. On the one hand it is identified with a specific politics, defined by “the street,” “the people,” in which the mainstream art world has little sustained interest.
But at the same time, Latinx art is hard to pin down. It crosses national borders, mixes social histories, and spans the color range, encompassing Black, brown, red, yellow, white, and mixtures of all of those. (A 2020 book, “Latinx Art: Artists, Markets, Politics” by the cultural anthropologist Arlene Dávila, lays out all these contradictions.) To an art world reliant on pitch-ready hooks and slots, it feels unexotically diffuse and ignorable.
This dismissive perspective is racist, and classist, and just plain wrong. It is the necessary job of El Museo del Barrio, a formative Latinx institution, to correct it. The museum has announced that the present show will be the first in a series of three, spread over as many years, to explore its own early history. That history is, of course, a quintessentially Latinx history, and the subject is immense. If El Museo did nothing more, from this time forward, than focus its attention on Latinx art and its complex past and electric present, it would have its hands, and its galleries, more than full."

Obituaries for the American Dream

We’ve been talking about “the American dream” since James Truslow Adams coined the phrase in his 1931 book, “The Epic of America.” But what’s a dream anyway? A brimming over of the day’s repressed desires? Just a flutter of the neurons? If the American dream was ever real, it isn’t now.
Lizania Cruz, a Dominican artist and curator, has been asking people to write obituaries for the American dream. When and how, she asks, did the American dream die for you? It died, they said, “when I became aware of the fact that my family was considered ‘illegal’”; “when I realized that after working 50 hours a week I was not able to save”; “when I realized just how many of my fellow Americans valued selfishness over community, power over justice, prejudice over fairness, greed over generosity, demagogy over science.”
We invited our readers to respond to the same question. More of this project can be found here. It was commissioned by El Museo del Barrio for “Estamos Bien: La Trienal 20/21,” a survey of Latinx contemporary art."

Georgia Recertifies Election Results, Affirming Biden’s Victory
By Richard Fausset and Nick Corasaniti

Georgia election officials on Monday recertified the results of the state’s presidential race after another recount reaffirmed Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory over President Trump, the third time that results showed that Mr. Trump had lost the state.
The announcement delivered the latest blow to Mr. Trump’s tumultuous attempts to subvert the outcome of the election in Georgia, an effort that has caused infighting and name-calling among some Republicans.
“We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,” Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said at a news conference.
Mr. Biden has prevailed in three separate counts of the ballots: the initial election tally; a hand recount ordered by the state; and the latest recount, which was requested by Mr. Trump’s campaign and completed by machines. The results of the machine recount on the secretary of state’s website show Mr. Biden with a lead of about 12,000 votes.
Mr. Raffensperger’s announcement came less than 48 hours after Mr. Trump appeared in the state at a rally intended to support the candidacies of Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are locked in high-stakes runoff races on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the Senate. The president, however, spent much of his appearance airing a long list of personal grievances over his loss to Mr. Biden in Georgia and elsewhere, claiming falsely that fraudulent voting had stolen the election from him.
Mr. Raffensperger on Monday chastised both Mr. Trump and Stacey Abrams, who acknowledged her loss in the race for governor in the state in 2018 but who claimed that race was rendered fundamentally unfair because of Republican-designed policies that Democrats have described as voter suppression efforts. Ms. Abrams has said that the 2018 election was “stolen from the voters.”
Mr. Raffensperger said, “All this talk of a stolen election, whether it’s Stacey Abrams or the president of the United States, is hurting our state.”
He also said that he would support legislation offering “a major reform of our election processes” in the coming state legislative session.
It was one of numerous signs that the future of elections in Georgia — a once reliably red state that has seen a Democratic resurgence in recent years — is likely to remain an emotional and litigious battleground over voting rights and access to the polls.
For the Senate runoff races, election officials in Cobb County, the state’s third most populous county, are planning to open fewer than half of the early voting locations that were available in the general election. Voting rights groups said on Monday that the changes would harm Black and Latino voters.
Mr. Biden won Cobb County, part of the Atlanta suburbs, by 14 percentage points, improving on Hillary Clinton’s two-point margin in 2016. But the county is planning to open only five early voting locations for the runoffs, down from 11, one of the largest such reductions in the state. Nearly 400,000 people voted in Cobb County in the general election, many through early in-person or mail-in voting.
Janine Eveler, the director of elections in Cobb County, said that the county was forced to cut back on polling locations because of severe staffing shortages. “It was not our desire to reduce the number of early voting locations for the runoff, but, unfortunately, it became a necessity,” she said in a statement.
But Georgia Democrats see partisan politics at play in a county that is currently controlled by Republicans. They noted that the locations that were closed were in largely Democratic neighborhoods, including places with large Black and Latino populations.
Voting rights and civil rights groups pleaded in a letter to Ms. Eveler and other officials to keep all 11 sites open.
“Georgia’s Black and Latinx residents are more likely to live in poverty than other residents and will have more difficulty traveling long distances to access advance voting locations, especially because of the limited public transportation options in Cobb County,” the letter said. “As a result, the elimination of advance voting locations will discourage or prevent many of Cobb County’s Black and Latinx voters from participating in the runoff election.”
Groups including the N.A.A.C.P. and Fair Fight Action, the voting rights organization led by Ms. Abrams, had offered to help recruit more election workers, but Ms. Eveler said there would not be enough time to train them.
On Sunday, Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, and Mr. Raffensperger both said in television interviews that it was clear that Mr. Biden had won the state. But in a debate that evening between Ms. Loeffler and her Democratic rival, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, Ms. Loeffler declined to say, when questioned, that Mr. Trump had lost the election.
Mr. Trump has been pushing Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, to order an audit of voters’ signatures on ballots. The governor has said that he would also like to see an audit, but he has argued that his office does not have the authority to order one.
The president had also urged the governor to order a special legislative session in which lawmakers might assign a new slate of Electoral College members who would favor him. But the governor repeatedly declined to call for a special session, and he said in a statement on Sunday that such a gambit was not allowed by state or federal law.
Yet Mr. Trump continued to pound away at Mr. Kemp on Monday. “The Republican Governor of Georgia refuses to do signature verification, which would give us an easy win,” he wrote on Twitter. “What’s wrong with this guy? What is he hiding?”
It was unclear how an audit of signatures might help Mr. Trump’s cause. When absentee ballots are processed by county elections officials, they come in envelopes with the voters’ signatures on the outside. These signatures are checked against the signatures in state databases. But the envelopes are then separated from the ballots to ensure voters’ anonymity. That means that individual ballots could not be questioned even if problems with the signature-matching process were to come to light.
A top official in Mr. Raffensperger’s office, Gabriel Sterling, also spoke at the news conference on Monday and addressed other misunderstandings and unfounded conspiracies, sarcastically referring to the presentation as “Disinformation Monday.”
Among other things, Mr. Sterling denounced as bogus a claim that suitcases of ballots were illegally brought into a Fulton County elections center, and a rumor circulating on the internet that two Democratic state senators had been involved in counting ballots.
Also on Monday, a federal judge in Atlanta tossed out a lawsuit alleging a vast conspiracy to hack into and manipulate voting machines in Georgia. The suit had been filed by Sidney Powell, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump whom his campaign has disavowed."

Latinos, Long Dismissed in Hollywood, Push to Make Voices Heard
By Nicole Sperling

Tanya Saracho landed her first television writing job on the Lifetime soap “Devious Maids” in 2012. She was a diversity hire.
It’s an official term for a practice meant to encourage inclusion. In an effort to make writers’ rooms — long the bastion of white males — more diverse, studios pay the salary of a minority writer so the show doesn’t have to. Ms. Saracho finds the idea noble but also inescapably problematic.
“You get otherized and marginalized and then you are expected to be the culture negotiator and ambassador and defender of every culture, not just yours,” Ms. Saracho, 44, said in a recent video interview. “It’s a big burden. I almost quit every day.”
Instead, Ms. Saracho persevered and achieved success in an industry that hasn’t always been welcoming to her: a queer writer interested in exploring her Mexican-American heritage on television. She wrote for HBO’s “Looking” and “Girls” and spent time on Shonda Rhimes’s “How to Get Away With Murder.” Her big break came when Marta Fernandez, then the senior vice president of original programming at Starz, invited her to create a show, “Vida,” about two estranged sisters returning to their East Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights to bury their mother. The show, which made its debut in 2018, tackled issues of gentrification and assimilation through the prism of family. It was well-reviewed and for three seasons served as an example of what’s possible when underrepresented voices are given a chance to succeed.
But “Vida” was canceled in March. That was followed by ABC ending the sole network TV show with a primarily Latino cast, “The Baker and the Beauty,” in June. And though CBS reran the truncated fourth season of the Latino-centric reboot of “One Day at a Time” in October, the fate of that show remains unclear. (Netflix first canceled it in 2019.)
To many Latinos working in Hollywood, it seems that every gain is soon followed by a loss, a continuous ebb and flow that never feels rectified.
“It’s great ‘Vida’ existed, but ‘Vida’ is now gone,” said Ms. Saracho, who began her career as a playwright in Chicago, where she co- founded a theater company and an alliance for Latino playwrights. “‘One Day at a Time’ is gone now, too. We haven’t arrived.”
According to a Writers Guild of America West study issued in June, while Hispanic-Latinos account for 18.3 percent of the population, they represent only 4.7 percent of feature film writers and 8.7 percent of television writers. The University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative called Hollywood’s treatment of Latinos both behind and in front of the camera “an erasure” in a 2019 study.
The grim stats, coupled with personal experiences, prompted Ms. Saracho, Gloria Calderón Kellett (“One Day at a Time”) and the 16 other Latina showrunners who make up the Untitled Latinx Project group to start promoting their own cause.
In the middle of October, on the final day of National Hispanic Heritage Month, the group delivered an open letter to Hollywood demanding change in an industry that has long overlooked them. It bore the names of 276 Latino creative people, including film screenwriters and well-known names like Lin Manuel-Miranda, John Leguizamo, Eva Longoria and the writer and producer Phil Lord (“Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse”). And it made specific demands: Stop telling our stories without us, start greenlighting more of our projects, reflect the diversity of our population and hire us for projects that aren’t about the Latino community.
The letter arrived in Hollywood’s inboxes shortly before the 2020 election, which shined a spotlight on the diversity of Latinos in the United States. Latinos make up the second-largest voting group in the country, but they defy blanket classification. For example, Latinos in Florida and Texas, including many of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, leaned toward President Trump, while young progressive Latinos in Arizona, including a number of Mexican descent, favored Joseph R. Biden Jr.
It was a stark reminder that grouping Puerto_Ricans, Cubans, Mexican-Americans and others into one monolithic racial group, as Hollywood has done for decades, diminishes their disparate experiences and concerns. Stacy L. Smith, the founder of U.S.C.’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in an interview that Latino characters in Hollywood movies are most often depicted as “criminals, as low income, as immigrants, as isolated, as hungry.”
Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, who leads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, went further, arguing that these depictions have real-world consequences. In a recent column in the Hollywood trade publication Variety, he wrote, “You can draw a clear line from the pervasive lack of positive Latino representation onscreen to the rise in hate crimes against our communities.”
The Untitled Latinx Project is one of the groups trying to change that. Last year, the women partnered with Franklin Leonard and his company, The Black List, which aims to promote the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood, to create the inaugural Latinx TV List. It showcases one-hour and half-hour original pilots written by at least one Latino writer and featuring a Latino or Latin American character in a prominent role. The top three finishers landed deals with the streaming service Hulu. Many secured agency representation.
“We found 10 great writers who just happen to be Latinx who are just as good as anybody else that is already as a professional working writer,” Mr. Leonard said.
Advocates say that findings like that demonstrate how Hollywood’s issue is not a lack of creative voices to choose from but a lack of executives willing to take a chance and nurture new talent.
“If people are as committed to diversity and inclusion as they say they are, then they would make different choices,” Ms. Calderón Kellett said. “That’s why Tanya and I are pretty loud about talking about the inequality that we see consistently and trying to call for some real change.”
Ms. Saracho, for one, recognizes that without Ms. Fernandez at Starz, “Vida” never would have happened. “Who knows how she championed me and what battles she had to fight that I never saw,” said Ms. Saracho, adding that Ms. Fernandez also encouraged her to direct. “That’s what happens when you have one of you in the castle.”
But Ms. Fernandez left Starz last year for a job running the television department at Macro, a production and finance company intended to bolster voices of color. In addition to developing new shows with writers of color, she is also grooming executives of color who she hopes will one day land decision-making spots at the studios.
Ms. Saracho and Ms. Calderón Kellett will continue following their own paths. Ms. Calderón Kellett signed an overall deal with Amazon Studios last year. Ms. Saracho signed one this August with NBCUniversal’s television studio, Universal Content Productions, which, in addition to making new shows, will create a talent incubator for Latino creators.
Ms. Saracho is now in London, collaborating with the indie musician Johnny Flynn on a new pilot for Universal Content Productions called “Love Story” that centers on one heart-wrenching love story a season. The debut will focus on two Mexican-American childhood friends living in London who fall in love with the same singer-songwriter. (Mr. Flynn is writing the music and helping Ms. Saracho navigate the world of the anti-folk British indie music scene.)
Ms. Saracho is energized by the project and encouraged by the response her group’s letter has received. But she knows there is a long way to go.
“I don’t understand why they don’t take a chance on us but they will take a chance on the most tepid refried-bean cop show,” she said. “I think it’s a side effect of how we are viewed in this country, in a stereotyped way, a limited way. Those winds waft to Hollywood and it sort of seeps in everywhere. It hurts.”"

Words of Gratitude From Utah
By Paisley Rekdal

These past months, I’ve seen something unusual: crowds in the canyons. The pandemic has forced people out of gyms and into our mountains and parks. It’s made our wild spaces more multiracial; I now get stopped regularly by Latinx and Pacific Islander families asking about the nearest trailhead. Children cluster on trails to exclaim over a tarantula or a coyote whisking into the brush. An influx of red squirrels has swelled the raptor population in Salt Lake, and now strangers collect at sunset to bird watch. We think of nature as escape, but now it’s a safe place to be together. Our mountains have become a respite from our solitude, and for that, I am grateful."

‘Giving Voice’ Review: August Wilson Is Uplifting a New Generation
By Robert Daniels

The everyday hopes and heartbreaks of African-Americans were dramatized in August Wilson’s 10-play American Century Cycle. And every year, since Wilson’s death in 2005, thousands of students from 12 different cities vie for the chance to perform a monologue from one of his plays in a competition’s final round on Broadway. James D. Stern and Fernando Villena’s uplifting documentary “Giving Voice” (streaming on Netflix) further explores this competition and explains how the playwright’s legacy is inspiring a new generation.
Interviews with the actors Viola Davis, who is one of the film’s executive producers, Denzel Washington and Stephen McKinley Henderson (all from the film adaptation of Wilson’s “Fences”) are interspersed between segments that follow teenagers advancing through the 2018 iteration of the competition.
This is a film that worships the ways acting can instill determination in young people. Gerardo Navarro, from South Central Los Angeles, says he was unaware a space for Latinx actors existed in theater, but feels seen by Wilson’s work. Callie Holley, hailing from Houston, sees her mother, who weathered cancer and the 2008 financial crisis, in the character of Berniece from “The Piano Lesson.” And the Chicago high schooler Cody Merridith, who performs from “King Hedley II,” innately feels the hurt present in Wilson’s work. Not only does Cody come from the Auburn Gresham neighborhood, where poverty is a daily struggle for many of its residents, but also his school is without an arts program of any kind.
In addition to hearing themselves in the voices of these characters, the kids hear their aunts, uncles, grandparents and neighbors, too. They hear the timeless struggle of Black America reaching across the generations. They heave the emotional weight of Ma Rainey, Cutler and Hedley with a maturity far beyond their years and come out empowered. And in capturing these moments, “Giving Voice” becomes as inspirational as Wilson’s words, as fulfilling as each teen’s declaration of self-worth."

A National Museum for Latinos
By Arlene Dávila

On Monday, Congress authorized the creation of a Latino museum as part of a $2.3-trillion year-end spending bill. This is long overdue. For decades, activists have been fighting to establish a Latino museum on the Washington Mall. Its creation is essential to documenting the community’s contribution and to the education and future of all Americans.
And yet, some have questioned whether Latinx people, the United States’ largest “minority,” really need a new museum of their own, arguing that museums that collect or exhibit objects related to a particular ethnic or cultural group are divisive. Indeed, earlier this month, Senator Mike Lee of Utah blocked bipartisan legislation to establish a national museum dedicated to our stories, citing fears that the museum would “drive wedges among Americans,” and “worsen societal divides.” Others have argued that such an institution would further marginalize our art and our history.
Ideally, Latinx history — and for that matter, the history of all marginalized groups that are part of this nation — should be a central part of all museums and cultural institutions. But we’re not there yet. Even worse, systemic racism has made it so that our art, and our stories, continue to be overlooked within these spaces, which remain overwhelmingly white.
On the heels of a summer of reckoning over race, cultural institutions are now facing calls to better represent people of color, underscoring the important work that culturally and ethnic-specific museums have historically played.
Ethnic art organizations emerged in the late 1960s as part of larger civil rights demands for representation. Among those established then were the Studio Museum in Harlem, El Museo del Barrio, Taller Boricua, Self Help Graphics & Art.
Many of these legacy cultural institutions still find themselves fulfilling the same foundational role they served when they were first established. They continue to work to elevate, document and support marginalized artists, in a context where mainstream museums’ leadership, curatorial staff and collections remain white dominated.
Multiple studies have shown the skewed racial makeup of most American museums. For instance, a 2015 Mellon Foundation report on museum demographics, the first comprehensive study of staff diversity ever conducted on museums, showed non-Hispanic whites made up 84 percent of curators, educators and directors.
A 1994 report of the Smithsonian Institution Task Force on Latino Issues, titled Willful Neglect, showed systematic exclusion of Latinx culture and history in the Smithsonian Institution, calling for the hiring of Latinx curators to help direct the Smithsonian’s priorities in research, collections and exhibitions.
Yet over the past three decades, the task of reworking a mostly white institutional history and collection at the Smithsonian remains slow and daunting. In fact, a 2018 study by U.C.L.A.’s Latino Policy & Politics Initiative and its Chicano Studies Research Center, evaluating what progress had been made in the 24 years since the initial 1994 study, found that the Smithsonian’s Latinx work force failed to keep pace with the growth of the Latinx population, which had doubled to almost 18 percent of the total population since the first report was issued. The 2018 report also found that Latinx people are still missing from executive positions.
Ethnic-specific art and culture institutions hire and exhibit artists of color, filling the void left by the nation’s largest and major museums. Indeed, Latinx-specific spaces were foundational to the career and development of many of our current “art stars,” from MacArthur “genius” grantees, such as artists Pepón Osorio and Amalia Mesa-Bains — both of whom exhibited at El Museo del Barrio, Galería de la Raza and the Mexican Museum of San Francisco at the start of their careers — to younger generations, such as artist Ramiro Gomez, who was “discovered” after his first exhibition at the Chicano Studies Research Center Library of U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles.
There are countless other examples of Latinx artists and creators that have been sustained by ethnic-specific museums decades before they are “seen” and recognized in mainstream spaces. Most important, as an educator I think of all the students who only learn about these artists and histories by visiting Latinx-specific spaces, because they are not visible elsewhere.
Still, there are some critics who deride the value of “ethnic-specific” spaces — as politically threatening, but also ghettoizing. Even within our community many bemoan the hyphenated space as less valuable, tokenizing and, ultimately, as a self-imposed silo — overlooking how they are the product of a history of racialization and exclusion that make them so politically necessary.
Undoubtedly, challenging racism demands a radical transformation of all of our institutions. But it’s worth noting that we depend on these spaces to explore in greater detail and depth the diversity within diversity that characterizes Latinx communities.
With approval from the House and the Senate, the bill now needs presidential approval. Once the act is signed into law, we will then embark on the most important part of the process: building and planning a museum that is inclusive and representative of our diverse communities."

El Museo Looks to Define ‘Latinx Art’ With a Major Survey
By Holland Cotter

For much of the past year, New York City’s museum clock has been running on Covid time. When lockdown hit last March, exhibitions in progress went dark. Some later reopened for a last-gasp run. Others never saw the light again. Still others, originally scheduled to debut during the past several months, have had to carve out new slots. “Estamos Bien — La Trienal 20/21” at El Museo del Barrio, is one of the late-landing arrivals.
The show is El Museo’s first national survey of what it calls Latinx art, using the much-debated gender-neutral and (the museum argues) culturally embracing alternative to Latino or Latina, to describe artists of Latin American descent working primarily in the United States or the Caribbean. The museum’s original plan was to have the show coincide with, and reflect, two defining 2020 political events, the United States census and the presidential election. It missed both, but still looks plenty newsy. Immigration, racial justice and assertions of identity, ethnic and otherwise, are undying features of the national story. And the show is very much about them.
Its title, “Estamos Bien” — “We’re fine” — was inspired by a work in the exhibition, a 2017 painting by the Chicago-based Cándida Álvarez done in the wake of Puerto_Rico’s devastation by Hurricane Maria. Tinged with irony, the words suggest both resilience and bitterness. And much of the work by the show’s 41 other artists is complicated in a similar way.
Organized by the El Museo curators Rodrigo Moura and Susanna V. Temkin, along with the artist Elia Alba, the Trienal begins in an introductory gallery installed with hard-copy versions of digital works commissioned by the museum. One — created by the San Diego duo Collective Magpie (Tae Hwang and M.R. Barnadas) and titled “Who Designs Your Race?” — is an interactive, census-style survey, but driven by personal feelings, not statistical facts. It’s geared to revealing the racial and ethnic biases in its participants.
A second piece, “Obituaries of the American Dream” by Lizania Cruz — born in the Dominican_Republic and now based in Brooklyn — takes the form of written, short-statement answers by dozens of people to a question posed by Cruz: When and how did you lose your faith in the dream? The entire archive of responses, once readable only online, has been printed in a takeaway publication available in the gallery, and it’s a keeper.
Finally, a third introductory work is a single large photograph by the Philadelphia artist Ada Trillo of a 2020 Black Lives Matter “die-in” that took place in her home city after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The image of a mass of prone bodies, male and female, light-skinned and dark-skinned, stretching out as far as the eye can see — and surrounding a civic monument to George Washington, the nation’s slave-owning first president — catches the spirit of history-revising, justice-demanding energy that served as a background for the exhibition.
And that spirit is in the show, though often obliquely, in modest gestures and at low volume. A fair percentage of the work takes popular culture as source material. Yvette Mayorga paints in an 18th-century European rococo style but does so using cake-decorating techniques familiar from the Mexican bakeries in her Chicago neighborhood. Still life paintings by the artist and gay activist Joey Terrill — born in Los Angeles in 1955, he is, with Alvarez, one of the show’s two senior entrants — combine images of grocery items, buff brown male bodies, and H.I.V. medications. Another, younger Angeleno painter, Patrick Martinez, incorporates LED signage advertising face masks, Lysol wipes and toilet paper into his panoramic riff on marked-up city walls.
And in a sweet, short 2016 video titled “Dinner as I Remember,” Francis Almendárez revisits the family meals of his working-class childhood, presenting each dish as a lovingly produced masterwork.
Acknowledgment of family, near and far, is a recurrent element. It is evident in Groana Melendez’s photographic portraits of relatives networked between the Dominican_Republic and Washington Heights, and in portraits — each gold-framed — by Xime Izquierdo Ugaz, of an extended family of queer friends widely scattered across the Americas.
And for anyone for whom migration is still-recent history, place — where you leave and where you come to — is a resonant subject. Eddie R. Aparicio makes curtain-like rubber casts of the surfaces of ficus trees — which grow fast and disappear faster — in Los Angeles neighborhoods with large populations of Central American immigrants. María Gaspar, a first-generation Mexican-American, photographs herself embedded, half-hidden by camouflage, in landscapes encountered on her travels.
Gaspar made a memorable contribution to the exhibition “Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration” at MoMA PS1 earlier in the season. Imprisonment is a dark part of the Latino story in America, and the show acknowledges this. Among the digital entries is a team-produced visual database called “Torn Apart/Separados,” which includes images mapping the United States in terms of its hundreds of immigrant detention centers, public and private. ICE facilities are indicated by bright orange dots, and it comes as a jolt to see them spreading like cancer cells up and across the country.
Only one other work in a declaredly political show, a wall-filling video animation by the Texas-based Michael Menchaca, delivers a comparable information punch. Titled “A Cage Without Borders” and commissioned by El Museo, it’s a video-game-style version of a history of oppression of Indigenous peoples going back to the earliest European arrivals in the Americas. Installed in the show’s final gallery, a space the museum is using for the first time, the piece is hyperactive, assaultive, nonstop and furious, all good.
It can also stand on its own outside the context of the show, which can be said of a few other works too.
Among these I would point to Luis Flores’s life-size crocheted double self-portrait; to Ektor Garcia’s openwork column of butterfly forms, also crocheted but in this case from copper wire; and to a monumental smokey-gray print piece by Simonette Quamina. I also recommend a survey within the larger survey of work from the permanent collection of the Museum of Pocket Art (MoPA), established in 2004 in El Paso, Texas, by the artist Robert Jackson Harrington, and represented here by a changing selection of small fine things.
And then there’s a video by the Puerto_Rican puppet-and-performance collective that calls itself Poncilí Creación and consists primarily of the twin brothers Pablo and Efrain Del Hierro, who live and work in San Juan. They were quarantined there in 2020 when they made the video, and by the look of it they had the town almost to themselves, as they paraded through its locked-down streets, one brother beating out a catchy tattoo on a drum, the other wearing, strapped to his body, a mobile assemblage of fantastical soft-sculpture creatures. The two-man theater troupe goes where it pleases — deserted schools and government buildings are not off limits — and at one point attracts a fellow performer who tags along, talking revolution. He knows radicals when he meets them.
El Museo itself began as a radical experiment, an attempt, in an unwelcoming time and environment, to both preserve Latino culture and, resisting assimilation, move it forward. This was, and is, a tricky balance. Today, nearly a half century after its founding, this museum is still the only one in New York — and one of the few in the country — that regularly exhibits, collects and documents Latino work. I’m very glad its first triennial, imperfect but stimulating, has successfully landed. But I’m also thinking: Three years is a very long time to wait for another iteration of it, when so much new Latinx work — to use the show’s preferred term — is being made and so little attention is still being paid. All this being so, I encourage El Museo to keep this art always, somehow, in front of us, to give us fresh updates on it often, and to make those updates bold and open-armed — in short, to continue to push the envelope, hard."

When Wokeness Becomes Weakness
By Ross Douthat

Recently, James Carville, the unfrozen Clintonite of Democratic politics, stirred a predictable controversy by complaining about “wokeness” in an interview with Sean Illing of Vox. Everyone has a different definition of the term, but Carville’s was one you hear a lot from strategically minded Democrats: Wokeness is “faculty lounge” rhetoric, the language of elite hyper-educated progressivism, entering into mass politics in a way that turns a lot of normal people off.
Framed this way, intra-Democratic debates about the new progressivism often boil down to word choice and emphasis. Do you sound inclusive or out-of-touch if you say “Latinx” instead of “Hispanic”? Do you win more support for antipoverty policies if you talk about racial redress or pan-racial redistribution? Are voters actually worried about cancel culture, or are figures like Carville mistaking the Fox News bubble for reality?
In those debates I’m on Carville’s side: Indeed, I once wrote an entire column called “Liberalism’s Latinx Problem,” on the political costs of the new progressive style of discourse.
But at the same time I think the problem he’s describing could be manageable for Democrats, because their primary voters already figured out a way to manage it: Don’t nominate Elizabeth Warren, nominate Joe Biden instead. Or to depersonalize the strategy: Don’t nominate a candidate who talks like a member of the Harvard faculty, nominate the candidate who can talk like an old-line Democrat and, once elected, shovels money out the door.
This approach doesn’t fully solve the problem of being seen as “an urban, coastal, arrogant party,” in Carville’s formulation, but it mitigates it — which is how the Democrats won both Congress and the White House in 2020 even as elite institutions were being pulled leftward by the Great Awokening. Maybe Biden’s successors won’t be able to pull it off, but his model is clear enough: If you don’t sound like a very-online liberal, voters won’t punish your party nationally just because the Poetry Foundation is self-immolating or New York prep schools are re-enacting scenes from St. Petersburg in 1917.
If the new progressivism becomes truly politically disastrous for Democrats, on the other hand, it will probably involve not just off-putting or elitist rhetoric, but a dramatic policy failure linked to social justice politics.
The two places where that seems most likely to happen are crime and education. Crime is the more urgent case: 2020 saw a major spike in the homicide rate, back to late-1990s levels, which so far is carrying over into 2021. Biden’s speech to Congress last Wednesday made a vague connection between ongoing “bloodshed” and the liberal-friendly debate over an assault weapons ban, but it isn’t AR-15s doing most of the damage in the current murder wave. Instead, police demoralization and withdrawal in the aftermath of protests and riots seem like a crucial factor — along with (more speculatively) coronavirus school closures, widespread masking, and the general Covid-era suspension of normality.
Maybe we’ll revert to pre-2020 trends as normality returns. If we don’t, though, the Democrats’ problem won’t be the off-putting rhetoric of police abolition; it will be the reality of a rising body count as liberal politicians struggle to negotiate between activists, protesters, progressive prosecutors and cops. And that kind of failure could take what is, for now, the modest trend of some conservative-leaning Asian, Hispanic and African-American voters drifting rightward and make it an existential problem like the white-ethnic abandonment of the Democrats under Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
In education the stakes aren’t as mortal, but the dynamics could be similar. In the best case scenario for Democrats, blue-state public schools reopen without incident this fall, and the anti-racist curriculums being promulgated by progressives become like religion class in a worldly parochial school: a pinch of incense for a faith that doesn’t make much difference in the educational day-to-day.
In the worst case, though, the reopening goes badly even as activists alienate Democratic-voting but not-particularly-woke parents by making gifted-and-talented schools and programs disappear in the name of anti-racist equity. In which case you could get both an institutional crisis, with more engaged parents abandoning public schools, and a political backlash, with more recent-immigrant parents in liberal cities and suburbs following their Italian-American antecedents rightward.
I have liberal friends who are anxious about these possibilities but reassure themselves by thinking of them as local challenges, internal to liberalism, concentrated in regions where there really aren’t any Republicans anymore.
This seems like wishful thinking. Crime rates might have seemed like a local problem in the early 1960s, too, but soon they became key to the emerging Republican majority, and issues go national even more easily today. Donald Trump increased his vote in a lot of unlikely areas in 2020; there’s no reason to assume other Republicans can’t do the same.
So the core question facing Democrats isn’t how faculty-lounge rhetoric plays with today’s swing voters. It’s how left-wing policymaking might create tomorrow’s swing voters, if the liberal city becomes ungovernable again."

Julia Alvarez: What We Believe About Identity
By Julia Alvarez

This personal reflection is part of a series called The Big Ideas, in which writers respond to a single question: What do we believe? You can read more essays by visiting The Big Ideas series page.
One of the baffling things that happened when my family arrived in the United States in 1960 was having to find a term for ourselves. No one seemed to know where the Dominican_Republic was. Back then there weren’t that many Dominicans in the United States — the dictatorship made it difficult to emigrate. So when my family was asked where we were from, we couldn’t just say, “We’re Dominican, you know, like Sammy Sosa or Alex Rodriguez.” Our classmates often mistook our country for the other Caribbean nation of Dominica. “Oh, you lucky dog! We went there for spring break!” At least Dominica was in the same neighborhood of islands.
The hyphenated nationality (Dominican-American, Chinese-American, even African-American) hadn’t yet been invented. If we had to check a box, the sorry options we were given (“Negro,” “Eskimo,” etc.) didn’t include us. We were vaguely of “Spanish origin,” which was better than the more deprecating slurs of the playground: “spic,” “wetback,” “greaser.”
I was born in Nueva York, but my parents returned to their homeland when I was a month old. They immigrated again when I was 10. I was American, but not American. I was an immigrant but not really. From the get-go, my identity wasn’t easy to untangle. I didn’t know how to talk about who I was, but I knew what made me uncomfortable. The two models of Spanish origin in popular culture were Miss Chiquita Banana and Ricky Ricardo — one, an over-the-top Latina “bombshell” touting her wares, both her bananas and her curvaceous self, and the other the butt of jokes, who brought on an outpouring of canned laughter whenever he opened his mouth. (Needless to say, I did not love “I Love Lucy.”) The whole idea that I could be in charge of the nuances and complexities of my identity never occurred to me. All I knew were the either/ors.
There was no vocabulary to light up the margins where my outlier selves were camped, waiting for the borders to open and let more of my selves in. “To thine own self be true,” we read in my Shakespeare class, a mantra of my hippie friends. But which self? I wondered. I was large; I contained multitudes, like Señor Whitman. How to say so? English was still a tongue I was trying to negotiate, and I had yet to find a term for myself that felt exactly right.
A term like “female,” which described one aspect of myself, didn’t allow for the differences, contingencies and modifications that came from being the Latina variety of female. “Intersectionality” wasn’t a word anyone used, though the place it maps was where I was living. Only when I started writing did I find the space to explore, qualify and give nuance to the many selves of my self, the stories of my story.
In the 1980s, like Columbus “discovering” America, editors suddenly discovered ethnic writers, though many of us had already been writing for several decades, our work published by regional magazines and small presses. But with our  literary green cards came new identity challenges and assumptions for us to contend with. Did my characters always have to be Latinx? Did my plots always have to circulate around Latinx issues? Why were most of the books sent to me to blurb by Latinx or other ethnic authors? (“You’ll love it,” editors promised.) It’s not that I didn’t want to claim my ethnicity; it’s that I didn’t want to take on others’ limiting assumptions and scripts.
On top of this was the ongoing quandary of what to call ourselves. “Spanish origin” had morphed into “Hispanic,” which became stigmatized as a census-driven colonized term, one that ignored our Indigenous and African selves. Many of us, uneasy with those erasures, shifted to “Latino/a” (although that term recalled no bigger colonizer than the Roman Empire); then came “Latin@,” a more inclusive, gender-neutral description; and more recently “Latinx,” each term an effort to define ourselves and assert control over our journeys. And so by trial and many errors, putting my foot in my boca any number of times, I struggled to articulate what it meant to be a lived identity, not a performed or assigned or co-opted one.
Recently, a fellow ethnic writer and I reflected on coming of age in a world before multiculturalism. “And yet we’re still writing!” she crowed. The undefeated. It was such a relief to let my hair down with someone who felt the same bemusement and weariness at having come through the fire to yet more fire.
I was left wondering what it meant to have survived all these changes in the zeitgeist and in myself? What core principle of being had come through the fires of rejection, neglect and erasure? The triumph I most want to claim as I move into old age is surviving with that core intact.
One of the gratifications of growing older is hearing from younger Latinas that reading my work and that of my fellow contemporary Latina writers helped them understand their lives in all their complexity and variety. We all needed vocabularies, stories and testimonials, and over the 50-year stretch of my writing and publishing life, I’ve increasingly seen those needs satisfied. The borders have opened, at least on paper, for many of us.
But now as I enter my 71st year, I find myself in a shifting relationship with the identities I’ve spent a lifetime fighting for, shaping and claiming. Call it old age — or the result of years of practicing meditation, where the focus has been on letting go of the ego and embracing emptiness — but these days I’m more interested in shedding selves. In returning to a core self, the mother root.
More and more I’m drawn to the aesthetic of Japanese haiku, in which the extraneous and unnecessary is stripped away, leaving behind something charged and vital. I’m in awe of short, poetic novels that reside in the borderlands and liminal spaces of genre. I ache for fictional companions, older characters, especially older Latinas, accurately portrayed, not airbrushed into clichés (the wise abuelita, the once-beautiful señora of the autumnal patriarch, the red-hat-purple-shawl viuda alegre, the cantankerous gruñona — all the lite inhabitants of crone lit). How to report accurately on this stage of the journey, on the selves left behind, on what identity looks and feels like at this later stage of life?
The struggles are still necessary to fight. The layers still have to be lived through. You can’t shed an identity you never had the chance to claim and live out. As the gentle and brilliant Ocean Vuong writes, “Sometimes you are erased before you are given the choice of stating who you are.” We have to go back and help those who cannot get out, as my veteran compañera Sandra Cisneros reminds us at the end of “The House on Mango Street.” Nobody gets to be excused from the transforming work of love.
In one of his later poems, “The Layers,” Stanley Kunitz writes of the many lives and layers he has lived and left behind. And yet, “some principle of being / abides, from which I struggle / not to stray.”
Being a member of an ethnic “minority” has meant living in and through the many definitions and layers that a new language and culture provided. How do we understand a core self that survives intact from these assaults to its full diversity? (Finally in older age, I understand Toni Morrison’s defiant statement that she was not writing for the white gaze, which starts with not living in the blinding light of that othering gaze.)
Near the end of “The Layers,” a voice directs the old poet, overwhelmed by the wreckage a life inevitably leaves behind, to “live in the layers, / not on the litter.” Why dwell on the grievances, on the litter of bitterness, the distortions of others, the restrictive boundaries of smaller selves? I want, instead, to live with an awareness and appreciation of all the layers. Doing so involves accepting my own diversity, forgiving myself, seeing myself with perspective, humor, generosity and tolerance, and extending all of the above to others and to their struggles, which have also been and continue to be my own.
That might be the core principle that guides me, what I believe: not content or credo, but a way of being in the world — a life lived in kindness and kindredness, in abiding love.
Meanwhile, there is work still to do. As Kunitz writes in the final line of his poem: “I am not done with my changes.” The territory of identity in later life needs to be explored and articulated. Just as our earlier stories helped younger Latinas and other readers understand themselves, our elder stories today may help them in later life. What does it mean to be an elder not only in the ongoing struggles of our communities of color but also in the hugest civil rights struggle facing us all, that of saving the planet? As I grow old, I might only be able to show up on the front lines in the lines I write.
That would be a satisfying close: to disappear, like Walt Whitman, under boot soles — to be the ground others can stand on."

Sophie Rivera, Photographer of Latin New York, Dies at 82
By Penelope Green

Sophie Rivera, a photographer who won acclaim making luminous portraits of Puerto_Rican New Yorkers and other city dwellers before turning the camera on herself, died on May 22 in the Bronx. She was 82.
Her husband, Dr. Martin Hurwitz, a psychiatrist, said the cause was a neurodegenerative disease. She lived in Upper Manhattan and had been in a hospice facility in the Bronx.
Ms. Rivera, who was of Puerto_Rican descent, began making portraits of her neighbors in the late 1970s, asking passers-by in front of her Morningside Heights apartment building if they were Puerto_Rican. If they said yes, she invited them to be photographed.
The images she made were majestic four-by-four-foot prints of everyday New Yorkers of all ages. They were time-stamped by their hair styles and clothing as citizens of the 1970s and ’80s, but they were made eternal by their direct gazes, formal poses and the nimbus of light with which Ms. Rivera surrounded them.
Vivien Raynor of The New York Times likened these Nuyorican Portraits, as they were known, to the portraits of Édouard Manet; The Times’s Holland Cotter described them as incandescent.
Ms. Rivera was part of a group of Puerto_Rican photographers, mostly men, who had set about documenting their community, seeking to wrest back their story from the wider society in which they were often stereotyped. It was a time when contemporary Latinx artists were nearly invisible in museums and galleries. Inspired by the social activism of the 1960s, the group formed a collective and nonprofit called En Foco — in focus.
“What struck me was that Sophie was always right there, she was just part of that scene, one of the few women,” said Elizabeth Ferrer, chief curator at BRIC, an arts organization in Brooklyn and the author of “Latinx Photography in the United States: A Visual History,” published this year.
“The photo world in general was very machismo,” Ms. Ferrer added, in a phone interview. “Sophie was small and quiet, but she made her presence known. She was making street photography when New York was really at its nadir. The camera made her fearless. It gave her a mission and a purpose.”
In the wild West that was much of New York City in the 1970s, there weren’t many positive images of Puerto_Ricans. Movies and books typically relegated them to minor roles as drug dealers, addicts and hustlers. Ms. Rivera worried about Puerto_Ricans’ representation, or lack of it, in American culture, she told Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, a former curator at El Museo del Barrio, the Manhattan museum devoted to Hispanic artists.
“Sophie wanted to record her people with dignity and tenderness,” Ms. Aranda-Alvarado said.
She was a constant, prolific street photographer who captured the denizens of her own neighborhood and beyond in lush images. (She was particularly drawn to the subway.) Ms. Ferrer likened them to those of Benedict J. Fernandez, a Puerto_Rican Italian photographer who died in March. Yet this work of Ms. Rivera’s is her least known.
Charles Biasiny-Rivera, a co-founder of En Foco, said in an interview: “She was a very independent soul, and she had her own way of seeing things and giving some order to it. Her series of frontal portraits were stupendous.”
He added, drawing a parallel to Richard Avedon: “Her photography was not in any kind of mode, though Avedon was also beginning to make portraits in a similar manner. It was simply a sort of facing what was before you. Her images didn’t play tricks.”
Ms. Rivera’s photographs are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, El Museo del Barrio and the Smithsonian American Art Museum, among other institutions.
Her work was bold and inviting, but in person Ms. Rivera was shy and reserved, a slight woman who often wore dark glasses. (She had vision difficulties later in life, her husband said, but early on she made a habit of wearing sunglasses to keep men from hitting on her.)
“She had no small talk,” said Susana Torruella Leval, director emerita of El Museo del Barrio. “If I tried to pry a little bit — ‘Is this because you felt marginalized?’ — she would clam up. There is an empathy in her work. I think she knew what poverty was. I think she knew what suffering was. I don’t know the nature of it because she didn’t let me in.”
Sophie Rivera was born on June 17, 1938, in Brooklyn, the youngest of five daughters. Her father, Frank, was a mechanic; her mother, Sarah, was a homemaker. Her parents separated when she was 5 or 6, and she was sent to St. Michael’s Home, an orphanage on Staten Island, where she remained through high school. She studied ballet privately and worked as a secretary before turning to photography in her 20s, taking classes at the New School and the Art Students League.
Dr. Hurwitz and Ms. Rivera met on Orchard Beach in the Bronx in 1961 and moved into their apartment in Morningside Heights a few years later; they married in 1990. Ms. Rivera set up her studio in the apartment, and it was from the building’s stoop that she found the subjects for her Nuyorican series.
“She could choose one person out of a hundred and make a connection,” said Dr. Hurwitz, who is her only immediate survivor. “She could connect with anyone.”
She was also, he said, an ardent feminist, whose earliest work included essays and photojournalism for feminist magazines. In June 1984, she marched with hundreds of women in front of the Museum of Modern Art, protesting a dearth of work there by female artists; earlier that year she wrote an article criticizing art history books for ignoring female photographers.
Ms. Rivera turned the camera on herself in the late 1980s, photographing her naked body and, in another series, her bodily wastes in a toilet bowl, disconcertingly rendered into beautiful, abstract shapes. This was the work Cecilia Fajardo-Hill and her co-curators chose for “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985,” a hit exhibition of Latina artists first shown at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in 2017 and at the Brooklyn Museum the following year.
“Everything about Sophie Rivera’s work is relevant for today,” said Ms. Fajardo-Hill. “She was an artist thinking about the body, about love, about representation and self-representation and what that means for a Latina — and a woman.”
For a time Ms. Rivera had her own gallery, which she ran out of an apartment in Washington Heights.
“She’s best known for her portraits, but she is also the great unknown street photographer,” said Ms. Ferrer, of BRIC. “I think that’s part of her power — wanting to capture everyday working people and using photography to reveal their humanity.”"

For Most Latinos, Latinx Does Not Mark the Spot

“Don’t you mean Latinx?”
My white classmate had a confident look on his face. I was one of the only Latinos in the school, but that didn’t stop him from labeling me.
“No, I don’t.”
Silence followed, and his confidence turned into confusion.
“It’s complicated,” I added, trying to ease the situation and avoid a full-on rant.
The United States has always had trouble categorizing people of Latin American descent, and the term Latinx is just the most recent example. Created as a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina, it has gained momentum over the past decade and is now used by politicians, universities and corporations eager to signal their awareness of this new term. Despite its good intentions, many Latinos, including myself, view it as problematic.
Latinx doesn’t work as an ethnic label mainly because it’s not even embraced by the community it describes; according to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, only 3 percent of U.S. Latinos use the term. Most haven’t heard of it, and those who have overwhelmingly reject it. Many of us find Latinx confusing or culturally offensive.
This is partially because of the term’s linguistic nuances. Latinx is an Anglicization of our language, an artificial label that defies the basic rules of Spanish pronunciation. To native Spanish speakers, Latinx feels foreign and imposed.
Conversations about gender inclusivity in Latin America have already been happening since long before the introduction of Latinx. Activists in Argentina have offered Latine as a non-Anglicized gender-neutral option which actually works in Spanish. Other accepted gender-neutral terms include Latin and Latin American. These alternatives prove that Latinx is simply not necessary.
Language changes over time, but such adaptations must be organic. Forced changes from outside our community are a form of linguistic imperialism, which centers the English language and perpetuates cultural erasure. At its core, this is an issue of linguistic self-determination. The Latino community doesn’t need politicians and corporations to “fix” our language; we can confront our community’s issues on our own terms.

It’s important that our society move toward gender inclusivity. But imposing an unwanted label on another community isn’t the right way to do that. While well-intentioned, the use of Latinx creates more problems than solutions, and makes Latinos feel ignored and disrespected.
To would-be allies, rather than rushing to embrace the latest progressive shibboleth, please step back and allow us the space to identify ourselves on our own terms. I am not Latinx. I am Latino, Latine, Latin or Latin American, and I’ll resist any attempt by someone else to define me con todo mi corazón."

Control of New York’s Stages Remains in White Hands, a Study Finds
By Michael Paulson

As New York’s theaters prepare to reopen following the twin crises of a pandemic and rising discontent over racial inequity, a new study which found that both power and money in the theater world have been disproportionately controlled by white people is calling for “a fundamental paradigm shift.”
The study, by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition, found that at the 18 major nonprofit theaters examined by the group, 100 percent of artistic directors were white, as were 88 percent of board members. On Broadway, 94 percent of producers were white, as were 100 percent of general managers.
The study offers a direct challenge, not only to theater leaders, but also to those who fund the institutions, saying, “it remains to be seen whether or not the multitude of antiracist solidarity statements and pledges to diversity will result in real action and systemic change.”
“Our expanded leadership stats confirm that almost every gatekeeper, employer and decision maker in the NYC theater industry is white,” the coalition declares in a letter introducing the study.
They examined the 2018-19 New York theater season — the last full season before the pandemic — looking at every Broadway show, as well as the work of the nonprofits.
The coalition called particular attention to a dearth of shows about Asian Americans. “Even as the industry has made small gains in diversity in recent years, particularly at the nonprofits, our work at AAPAC has shown that Asian-focused narratives remain consistently minimized and overlooked,” the report says.
Among the other findings:
Using publicly available tax forms, the coalition calculated the public and private contributions to nonprofit theaters, and said that $150 million went to the 18 big nonprofits in the city that it referred to as “predominantly white institutions,” compared with $12.6 million to 28 theaters of color.
At the theaters studied, 59 percent of roles went to white actors, compared to 29 percent for Black actors, 6 percent for Asian American actors and 5 percent for Latinos (the coalition uses the gender-neutral term Latinx).
Creative teams were less diverse, with 81 percent of writers being white, along with 81 percent of directors and 77 percent of designers.
The report gave grades to individual theaters, and declared the Public Theater to be the most diverse, and the Irish Repertory Theater to be least diverse.
The intense focus nationally on diversity issues has prompted an increase in research about race, gender and disability within the theater industry. A coalition of groups doing such research, called Counting Together, formed in 2019, and this month introduced the CountingTogether.org website, hosted by the Dramatists Guild and the American Theater Wing, to make the research more readily available."

At a Queer Theater Festival, the Plays Are Brazenly Personal
By Sarah Bahr

Dima Mikhayel Matta has written about her home city before with language like “In Beirut, the streets smell of jasmine and coffee, and the morning call to prayer mingles with church bells.”
Was it lyrical? Yes, Matta, a queer playwright from Lebanon, said during a recent video interview. Was it also rosy? Yes.
“In the past, I was writing short stories that romanticized Beirut,” she said, “because it’s ‘poetic,’ right?”
Matta’s autobiographical play, “This is not a memorized script, this is a well-rehearsed story,” is one of three making its New York premiere this week as part of the National Queer Theater’s Criminal Queerness Festival, which presents innovative new stories by L.G.B.T.Q. artists from countries that restrict L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
And with that project, she made a decision: no more romanticizing.
With Beirut, she wanted “to face how I feel about it, and how so many of us feel about it,” she said of the city that in the past year has endured crises including a massive explosion in its port, economic collapse, political instability and the pandemic. “Because it’s difficult to live there, and it’s becoming more difficult.”
The festival runs Tuesday through Saturday outdoors at Lincoln Center and near the United Nations, and is part of Lincoln Center’s Pride programming, which also includes a concert on Friday by the multi-hyphenate artist Taylor Mac.
Adam Odsess-Rubin, the National Queer Theater’s artistic director, founded the festival in 2018 with the Egyptian playwright Adam Ashraf Elsayigh, who had recently immigrated to the United States.
“There was really no space for the kinds of stories I was trying to tell,” said Elsayigh, who now serves as the festival’s co-producer. “I wanted to create a space for stories about queer people outside of the United States and outside of a Western context.”
This year’s plays — which also include the Mexican playwright Victor I. Cazares’s “﹤﹤when we write with ashes﹥﹥,” and a staged reading of the Iraqi playwright Martin Yousif Zebari’s “Layalina” — address subjects including addiction, fluid identity, and global and social change.
In other words, they are not, Zebari said, works that he could present in his home country, where same-sex marriage is illegal and queer people do not have any protection against discrimination.
“It’s really risky for the writers to share these plays,” Odsess-Rubin said. “They might fear persecution even emailing in the script.”
But in interviews, the playwrights underscored that their works, while sourced from their specific life experiences in countries that criminalize queerness, contain themes anyone can relate to.
For Matta, it was her complicated relationship with Beirut — a feeling that, she said, people who have lived in the same place for most of their lives can relate to.
“The people who’ve attended my rehearsals have said they feel the same way about New York,” she said.
Cazares, a Tow playwright in residence at New York Theater Workshop, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them, said that they had felt pressure in the past to produce work that glossed over the less idyllic aspects of life on the border.
“As a queer Latinx playwright coming up in 2013, I was encountering a lot of resistance from other Latinx producers that did not want to produce work that was about drugs, guns or gangs,” Cazares said. “But that was my work, and it was also my lived experience of the border. I lived through a very violent drug war. You’re suffering through nights where you’re worried about your family.”
Cazares’s play, a love story set in Mexico, draws from their experiences as an addict and as someone whose family withdrew them from high school and shipped them off to a rural Illinois town to “go find Jesus Christ again” when they came out. (Cazares and their parents have since reconciled.)
“It was a very personal story for me,” they said. “But it’s not something I’m reluctant to share. I want to destigmatize addiction and being H.I.V. positive. I want people who have had these lived experiences to walk away not feeling alone.”
For Zebari, who is making his playwriting debut with “Layalina,” it was important to tell a nuanced story of the community he refers to as SWANA — Southwest Asian and North African.
“As an actor, I never spoke up when I felt like my voice was filler,” he said. “But now, as a playwright, I can tell my story.”
Odsess-Rubin and Elsayigh said that, in an ideal world, the festival would not exist because its plays would be produced elsewhere in New York. A recent study by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition found that at 18 major nonprofit theaters in the city, 81 percent of writers and directors were white.
Cazares said that they have had opportunities in which “if I would’ve written the happy story, or the more marketable, let’s-all-sing-about-conchas-and-abuelita take, it would’ve been produced.”
The festival’s audiences, the three playwrights acknowledged, likely will be mostly white. But they did have their dreams for who would be there on opening night. Cazares said their past self. Zebari said his father, though having him there would amount to coming out — something he hasn’t done, and isn’t ready for, with his family.
Matta said, “I would take great pleasure if a homophobic, racist person ends up in the audience and is too embarrassed to leave, and has to stay for an hour of me basically sharing things that go against everything that person believes in.”
“I’d find that very amusing,” she added. “My goal is not to make you comfortable. I am not here to explain why it’s OK for me to exist. I am here to transport you somewhere for an hour, and leave you with more questions than answers.”"

How We Talk About Race and Gender
By The New York Times

Much has changed in a year of racial reckoning that followed the killing of George Floyd and other Black men and women at the hands of the police, even the words we use to talk about these issues.
We are interested in how language on race and gender identity is changing. Terms like “systemic racism,” “people of color,” “BIPOC,” “antiracist,” “Latinx” and “Asian American” (unhyphenated) have become more widely used. Identifying one’s pronouns on social media or in video meetings has become more prevalent as well. A debate remains, though, about these changes in language: How much do they matter and, ultimately, how are they affecting the nation’s larger conversation about race and gender?
If you have a perspective to share about the changing vocabulary, we want to hear from you.

Foundations to Support U.S. Latino Artists With Cash Grants
By Siddhartha Mitter

Two major foundations have joined forces to make unrestricted cash grants to artists of Latin American or Caribbean descent born or living in the United States.
The venture, the Latinx Artist Fellowships, is backed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Ford Foundation, and aims to redress imbalances in national funding patterns while highlighting the range of these artists’ work and its cultural contribution.
The first 15 fellows, announced Monday, will each receive $50,000. Over five years, 75 artists will receive $3.75 million, with further support planned for museums and academic projects.
The fellows include artists at different stages in their career, from the 84-year-old Celia Álvarez Muñoz to established figures like Coco Fusco and Elia Alba, midcareer artists like Carolina Caycedo and rafa esparza, and younger artists like Carlos Martiel.
In a telephone interview, Rocío Aranda-Alvarado, a program officer at the Ford Foundation, and Deborah Cullen-Morales, a program officer at the Mellon Foundation, said that direct support to artists, not organizations, was atypical for large funders but felt necessary now, particularly in light of the hardships of the pandemic.
“There is an urgent need to immediately support artists as they continue to work and contribute to our society,” Cullen-Morales said. Aranda-Alvarado added: “We feel that by uplifting artists and their work we can help shift the landscape.”
Support to Latino artists suffers from a double deficit, they said. General philanthropic support to Latino recipients is small relative to their share of the population, they said, and within this, arts-focused funding is also limited. According to Hispanics in Philanthropy, an advocacy group, Latino arts and culture grants declined from $40.2 million in 2013 to $13.4 million in 2019.
In the art world, meanwhile, Latino artists in the United States are often grouped with artists based in Latin America, decreasing the opportunities to express the U.S. Latino experience.
“This community of artists tends to fall betwixt and between,” said Adriana Zavala, an associate professor at Tufts University who directs the US Latinx Art Forum, the organization that is administering the grant program.
Recipients did not apply, but were selected by a jury of major Latino curators. The awardees also include Miguel Luciano, Guadalupe Maravilla, Adriana Corral, Michael Menchaca, Delilah Montoya, Christina Fernández, Yolanda López, Vick Quezada and Juan Sánchez.
In a phone interview, Maravilla said he would use the grant to hire a studio assistant for the first time. “An award like this is really empowering to artists,” he said. “The money’s going to go fast, but it’s going to allow me to flourish, to take a giant leap forward.”"

The Spectacle of Latinx Colorism
By Karla Cornejo Villavicencio

This summer’s controversy over the underrepresentation of dark-skinned Afro-Latinos in “In the Heights,” the Hollywood adaptation of the Broadway musical, laid bare the cancer of colorism in Latinx communities in the United States. The reckoning was long overdue, a pain that goes back as long as our community has existed. And the mainstream media was enraptured. It created what I think of as the spectacle — el espectáculo. I haven’t seen as high a demand for Latinx voices since the Pulse shooting.
“Latinidad” is the shared language, childhood references, music, food, inside jokes and idiosyncratic TV Spanglish among the Latinx in this country. It is the sameness that unites us no matter where we grow up, and no matter where our parents were from. But the idea of sameness can devastate as much as it can connect. An open wound in this world of Latinx has been the shame around darkness, our own and that of our family and neighbors and compatriots. According to media by us or for us, dark-skinned Afro-Latinos do not exist and if they do, they aren’t Latino. Not really.
Some seem to derive schadenfreude from our colorism problem, while others with a platform use it to accrue social capital when we call it out. It’s the kind of performative racial conversation that allows Americans to proclaim how antiracist they are while they continue to gentrify our neighborhoods and hide the fact that they get paid more than their Black or Latina co-worker.
The main issue we are asked to write about, other than the border crisis, is the issue of anti-Blackness in our community. When interviewers have asked me what Latinidad means to me, I fumble. For many people, I am a representative of undocumented, brown Latinidad, but my Latinidad is complicated, and it is personal. That space of always wondering — of constantly creating a version of myself that incorporates my race, ethnicity, nationality, migration to America, education and all the rest of my history — is my Latinidad.
Latinidad isn’t a race, and you can be Latinx and be of any ethnicity. And we are still talking about and around Mestizaje — a race that doesn’t exist in the racial binary of white and Black in the United States. Lately I’ve caught myself comparing the skin color of Latinx artists in my movies and on my dust jackets with ugly feelings, looking at their eyes and lips and cheekbones and noses and jaws, looking for tells of ancestry, assuming deception and theft.
There are the reckonings we have among ourselves, and they are messy, loud and deeply specific; they are conversations that are nuanced, containing not only facts, but embodied, familial and community knowledge. They are probably not conversations we are having for the first time, and probably not the first time they have brought many of us to tears. Anti-Blackness in the Latinx world causes those of us with skin in the game deep pain. As a brown artist I am only consumable by American audiences when I write about extreme suffering. I suggest that we interrogate within ourselves what our personal and professional stakes are in this conversation.
I think of the casta paintings, colonial-era paintings depicting the interethnic mixing among Europeans, Indigenous peoples, Africans and the existing mixed-race population in the New World. The paintings typically depict a man, woman and child, arranged according to a hierarchy of race and status, and denote the racial mixing that has occurred. A taxonomic atrocity where the child of a Spaniard father and albino mother is labeled torna atrás, or “return backward,” while an Indigenous couple and their child are considered Indios mecos bárbaros, or barbarian Indians. The race of mestizos, a mix of white and Indigenous, is something that allows people to talk about citizenship without naming it. Our ancestral caste system is created by a recognition of race that is so obsessed with blood quantum and phenotype that it becomes eugenicist.
It’s true that some people hear Latino and think of Ricky Martin, but others think of job-stealing Mexicans — a different binary altogether, of citizen and alien. Campesino means peasant in Latin American Spanish, but it is a word that signals race as much as it does class. You can call someone a campesino as a slur to mean they look Indigenous, but not Indigenous enough to be romanticized as a noble savage, just Indigenous enough to be barred access to cultural and economic capital. These categories unify even as they divide: A Latino is a Mexican is a campesino is an indio is an illegal.
I cherish being a mixed-race person. Some of my mestizo family’s most ingrained traditions come from the Black Caribbean, like the salsa from Joe Arroyo, whose songs kept my head held high when I felt shame as an undocumented student at Harvard. We sometimes speak Quechua at home, especially to describe good or bad feelings in the body that don’t have words in English or Spanish. But I am not Black and I am not native. I have had to decide for myself what is a respectful enactment of my culture and what might be romanticization of ancestors I don’t know. What is an authentic expression of my culture and what is appropriation? It takes deep personal reflection. It takes education.
What was once Latin culture in New York, what was once Spanish culture in New York, has meant growing up mixed-race alongside mixed races. People on the ground — from organizers of racial justice movements and day laborer centers to gangs in New York and Los Angeles — have all placed deep emphasis on intersectionality and coalition-building. When we tear down what is rotten, we must build something new in its stead — we must support those on the ground dedicated to educating and organizing.
I moved from Ecuador to Brooklyn and then to Queens. In my neighborhood, nobody looked the same, and we shared common enemies — landlords, I.C.E., the cops, the blackouts, Giuliani, the new young white people who drove up rents. I feel that kinship with other Latinos, with immigrants, with Black people, with Asian people, because they were my neighbors. We shared the fire hydrants in the summer. We needed each other to make a life worth living for ourselves.
We share nutrients through our roots deep under the forest soil. We warn each other about encroaching dangers, and reach for the same piece of sky. Together, we must protect the saplings in the parts of the forest where sunlight does not reach, whose majesty is not visible to those just passing through. The goal, I think, is to stand strong and reliable, to stay alive ourselves and keep the others alive. And above all, send sweetness and strength to those who do not yet reach the sun themselves."

BIPOC or POC? Equity or Equality? The Debate Over Language on the Left
By Amy Harmon


In California, a Black college freshman from the South is telling a story about his Latino friends from home when he is interrupted by a white classmate. “We say ‘Latinx’ here,” he recalls her saying, using a term he had not heard before, “because we respect trans people.”
In Philadelphia, Emma Blackson challenges her white neighbor’s assertion that Black children misbehave in school more than others. “It’s just my implicit bias,” the neighbor offers, saying that she had recently learned the phrase.
In Chicago, Kelsey O’Donnell, 31, wonders why colleagues and friends have suddenly started saying “BIPOC,” an acronym that encompasses individuals who are Black, Indigenous or other people of color. Where had it come from? “There was really nobody to ask,” says Ms. O’Donnell, who is white. “It was just, ‘This is what we say now.’”
Americans have always wrestled with language when it comes to describing race, with phrases and vocabulary changing to meet the struggles and values of the moment. But especially in the wake of protests for social justice in the summer of 2020, there is a heightened attention to this language, say scholars and activists, as some on the left try to advance changes in the culture through words.
“You can’t change what you can’t name,” Cathy Albisa, vice president of institutional and sectoral change at the racial justice nonprofit Race Forward, said.
For some people, though, the new lexicon has become a kind of inscrutable code, set at a frequency that only a narrow, highly educated slice of the country can understand, or even a political litmus test in which the answers continually change. Others feel disappointment, after so many protests last summer demanded far deeper change on issues like criminal justice and voting rights.
“I really believed America was having a reckoning when it came to race,” said Ms. Blackson, a Black graduate student in epidemiology who has expressed her disillusionment on Twitter. “So far it’s been a lot of words.”
Unsurprisingly, the language itself has become contested, especially by conservatives who have leveraged discomfort with the new vocabulary to energize their base of white voters, referring to it as “wokespeak.” One conservative think tank circulated a list of words — including “microaggressions” and “Black Lives Matter” — that it said could alert parents that what has been labeled “Critical Race Theory” is being taught in their children’s schools.
The new language extends beyond race, adding phrases and introducing ideas that are new to many Americans. Gender-neutral terms like “Latinx,” for people of Latin American descent, “they/them” pronouns that refer to a single person, and “birthing parent” or “pregnant people” instead of “mother,” to be inclusive of trans people, are also gaining traction.
Some activists defend the focus on language, saying that the way people use words is not mere symbolism but is necessary to achieving justice.
“Saying something like, ‘Black people are less likely to get a loan from the bank,’ instead of saying, ‘Banks are less likely to give loans to Black people,’ might feel like it’s just me wording it differently,” Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, said. “But ‘Black people are less likely to get a loan from the bank’ makes people ask themselves, ‘What’s wrong with Black people? Let’s get them financial literacy programs.’ The other way is saying, ‘What’s wrong with the banks?’”
Mr. Robinson added, “When you’ve been on the margin, being able to claim a language and a narrative and a set of words to express yourself is incredibly important.”
Still, some other self-identified liberals who said they care deeply about social justice feel uncomfortable with some of the changes and the pressure that can be associated with them.
Ms. O’Donnell of Chicago said that, especially when she is among other white, college-educated liberals, “I’m exhausted by the constant need to be wary or you’ll instantly be labeled racist or anti-trans.”
And Stephen Paisley of Ithaca, N.Y., said he cringed at hearing libraries described at an academic conference as “sites of violence,” which is intended to reflect biases in how their rare books collections are curated. Rather than language that “tries to guilt people into action,” he said, he wishes the message was “white people, too, suffer from living in a society in which racial injustices and inequities persist.”
Changing Language, Changing Views
Many of the words surfacing in today’s language debates are not new.
“Implicit bias” traces to the work of psychologists in the 1990s, when the field began to document the subconscious associations that cause people to harbor stereotypes. The effort to substitute “enslaved people” for “slaves” has been long advocated by many Black academics to emphasize the violence that defined American slavery and the humanity of those subjected to it, said Anne Charity Hudley, a linguist at Stanford.
But it is only recently, Dr. Hudley said, that “all these terms are swirling around more in the public consciousness.”
The murder of George Floyd by the police and the outraged protests that followed — in large cities but also in small towns and suburbs across the country — was one catalyst for spreading the terms. The words reverberated across social media and book groups. The word “racism” is being looked up online twice as often as before the killing of Mr. Floyd, according to Merriam-Webster, which has updated its definition to illustrate how racism can be systemic. And more companies, small and large, began requiring language training as part of broader programs they say are aimed at creating a more welcoming culture for diverse work forces.
In a reflection of its surging popularity, “BIPOC” (pronounced “bye-pock”) received its first Merriam-Webster dictionary entry this year, though a number of linguists said they were not sure how the term emerged.
One reason BIPOC has engendered both backlash and bewilderment, said Nicole Holliday, a linguist at the University of Pennsylvania, is because it seems to be an example of “top-down language reform.” Widely shared over social media last year, its champions have said it is intended to emphasize the severity of racial injustice on Black and Indigenous people. But few Black or Indigenous people use it, language scholars say.
In a national poll conducted by Ipsos for The New York Times, more than twice as many white Democrats said they felt “very favorably” toward “BIPOC” as Americans who identify as any of the nonwhite racial categories it encompasses.
In “Why BIPOC Fails,” an essay in a recent issue of the Virginia Law Review, Meera Deo, a sociologist and professor at Southwestern Law School, notes that the term can end up being “confusing” or “misleading.”
The acronym, which was widely adopted only in the last year or so, is often misread as meaning “bisexual people of color.” Asian and Latino Americans are often left to wonder whether they are covered by the “POC” part of the acronym.
Racial justice activists have also long distinguished “equality” from “equity,” but the latter has filtered into the mainstream more recently. Supporters of the word say that it is preferable to “equality,” which they argue suggests that equal treatment is sufficient to achieve fair outcomes — a premise they maintain disregards built-in disadvantages caused by past and present discrimination, and the need for policies to counteract them.
The terms can seem to change swiftly too. Some scholars are now arguing that “implicit bias” should be replaced with “complicit bias,” saying that the former has been used as a kind of exoneration from the biases one holds rather than a call to address them.
In another example, “L.G.B.T.Q.,” the abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning, has recently incorporated an “I” for intersex, for people whose biological sex characteristics don’t fit the traditional definitions of female or male, and an “A” for either asexual — someone who experiences little or no sexual attraction — or ally. And the addition of a “+” at the end is aimed at indicating that the term should not be seen as comprehensive.
“I’m trying to think why it makes me so angry that they keep adding letters,” said Laura Bradford, 52, of Nashville, Tenn., who is bisexual and married to a woman. “It’s like, ‘We’re trying to understand, but you’re making it too complicated!’’’
Still, like many Americans, Ms. Bradford said that she had felt “woken up” last summer after educating herself about racism in America. And the identity-politics term that disturbs her most is the pejorative use of “woke,” a word that has cycled through several meanings, including one that reflected her own experience but now carries the implication that social justice ideals are absurd or insincere.
“It’s mean,” she said. “Being woke is about realizing that you’ve been hurting someone for a long time.”
Reaching for Better Words
Whether using certain words is an indication of a willingness to upend the traditions that reinforce social inequalities, however, is unclear. For white liberals especially, “there is social pressure to engage with these words in the social moment,” Dr. Hudley said. “They see this as part of what it means to be an educated white person in certain places and spaces, whether they agree with it or not.”
The current struggles over language reflect meaningful shifts in thinking on some essential issues, experts say.
The addition of the word “structural” or “systemic” ahead of “racism,” for instance, stems from a broader acceptance of the idea that racism is not just personal prejudice but a set of disadvantages that start with the average white child being born into families that are wealthier than others, and extend to laws related to housing and voting, bank-lending policies and education systems.
“Compared to 18 months ago, the term ‘systemic racism’ is being used across the board, whether people are talking about it or denying its existence,” said the historian Ibram X. Kendi, whose book “How to Be an Antiracist” has been widely read.
For Nancy McDonald Ladd, a white senior minister at a Unitarian church in Bethesda, Md., that is made up of mostly white progressives, the fixation with language stems at least partly from a sincere desire to reorient one’s worldview. It can be hard to stay on top of lexical tweaks, which include words that distinguish between defining a person and describing a situation — “unhoused” instead of “homeless.”
Although the Rev. Ladd has sometimes seen her congregants’ deliberations over words as a substitute for more substantive action, the language is “not just virtue-signaling,’’ she said, referring to expressions of opinion intended to publicly demonstrate a person’s good character.
“It’s this deep-seated anxiety about failing,” she said. “So they’re reaching, we are reaching, reaching, reaching for the perfect language.”
Language change, linguists say, has long been a tool in shaping social perceptions of identity.
“Queer,” once a pejorative for gay, has been reclaimed as a self-affirming term, especially by a younger generation of the LGBTQIA+ community. “African American,” which became prevalent in the 1980s after the Rev. Jesse Jackson objected that “black” reduced the complexity of race to a skin color, is now being superseded by “Black,” with a capital “B,” to underline a shared political identity among disparate groups.
Changes in language, of course, also make people feel anxious because they signify changes in society.
The honorific “Ms.” for instance, encountered decades of resistance before it became a widely preferred alternative to identifying women by their marital status.
Talk Instead of Action?
Still others see the attention on language as a dodge.
Increasingly prevalent statements known as “land acknowledgments,” in which officials mention that a speech or public event is taking place on land once occupied by Indigenous people, have recently come in for criticism. Summer Wilkie, a member of the Cherokee Nation, suggested in a recent essay that they can simply seem shallow and take focus away from policies that support Indigenous people.
Those statements that are meant to convey “thank you” or indicate that the speaker is a “guest,” Ms. Wilkie said, are especially “empty and alienating.”
Lucia Martel-Dow, an immigration lawyer in liberal Marin County, has had a similar thought about white progressives who reflexively use “Latinx.” She has no problem with the term, which has been adopted by a small fraction of U.S. adults who identify as being of Latin American descent, to avoid defaulting to the masculine “Latino” and to be inclusive of people who identify as neither male nor female. But how many white Marin residents making a point to use inclusive language, she wondered, also supported changing the zoning laws to create more housing opportunities for Latin American immigrants?
“You can say ‘Latinx’ all day,” she said, “but if you’re not doing the work, I don’t care.”
Such observations are borne out in a national survey this year by Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Even white Americans with the highest levels of concern about racial discrimination, she found, ranked activities like “listening to people of color” or “educating myself about racism” as more important than “choosing to live in a racially diverse community,” “bringing racial issues to the attention of elected officials,” or voting.
One risk of using words without really meaning them, said Dr. Holliday, the linguist, is the overuse of a term — like “inclusion” — to the point where its meaning is diluted, which linguists call “semantic bleaching.”
At the same time, critics note, conservatives have leveraged discomfort with “woke language” to pass laws in several states limiting how teachers can discuss racism and sexism.
“Symbolic progress placates people who are pushing for change, and it also invites backlash from those who want to maintain the status quo,” said Dr. Deo, of Southwestern Law School. “So you might end up worse off than where you started.”
What makes this linguistic moment so fraught, language scholars say, is that the words are often a proxy for the debate over some of the nation’s most pressing cultural questions.
“Some of these terms will endure, and some will not,” said Viet Thanh Nguyen, a professor of English, American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. “But in the period where terms are new, we are still undergoing a political struggle whose resolution is not yet determined, so the words themselves become the site of conflict.”"

Everything You Think You Know About the Suburbs Is Wrong
By Jay Caspian Kang

The suburban school is an imagined space that invites an unhealthy amount of hyperbole, misinterpretation and fear. All-white classrooms with a few token Asians, expansive, well-kept playing fields and pickup circles filled with Volvo S.U.V.s driven by anxious, potentially reactionary mothers might still exist in small pockets of the country. But even many of those privileged spaces have likely seen significant demographic change over the past few decades.
Millions of minority families have moved outside the country’s largest cities over the past 20 years. At the same time, the number of people in these areas who are living under the federal poverty line grew by 57 percent between 2000 and 2015.
In an earlier edition of this newsletter, I wrote about the Sweet Home Central School District in suburban Buffalo, where — with an influx of Black, Latino and Middle Eastern refugee families, many of whom were poor — the schools had to adjust, adding language support and other social services.
These transitions don’t always go smoothly. As suburbs have gotten browner over the past two decades, they’ve hosted all sorts of racial fights. Spats over critical race theory and what should be taught in schools are just the latest iteration.
Loudoun County, Va., which became ground zero of stoking panic about education and critical race theory by the incoming governor, Glenn Youngkin, has become an example of many different political ideas, but they can’t be understood outside the local context. In the 1990s, over 80 percent of Loudoun County’s students were white. Today that number has dropped to 43 percent, after a large influx of Asian American and Latino families. Youngkin’s strong showing in Virginia’s suburbs, then, should be seen not only as a triumph of manipulation and messaging by the G.O.P. but also as the most recent nationwide response to demographic changes in the suburbs.
Readers of this newsletter have surely noticed that I have been focused on the recent Virginia gubernatorial election and the ways in which the G.O.P. leveraged education in its favor. My interest in this lies not so much in how effective the C.R.T. paranoia might have been in that race but more in how much Youngkin’s strategy exposed oversights and misconceptions within the Democratic Party — its fundamental misunderstanding of Asian American voters and the ways in which it tends to focus on race and inequality in urban areas while mostly ignoring what’s happening right outside city limits.
To better understand what has been happening in the suburbs and the bearing that shift has on politics, I spoke to R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy, a sociology professor at New York University who studies race and inequality in the suburbs. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What are some of the factors that have led to communities of color moving to the suburbs?
In the imagination of American folks, suburbs are the ideal and the embodiment of the American dream. You can own property. You can have a picket fence. You can control the kind of school you go to.
But as suburbanization happened after World War II, Black residents, Asian residents and Hispanic residents didn’t have the same access to that dream. And so when we got into the 1980s and 1990s, in particular, a number of Black, Asian and Hispanic families were saying, “Well, listen, I don’t want to deal with a crumbling infrastructure where taxes continue to rise and schools aren’t going well. I don’t want to deal with some of the challenges and problems that we have in central cities, things like crime and poverty.”
And so in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, folks who had the means moved out of central cities and into suburban areas, oftentimes with the idea that they could go to a place where they could customize and control what was happening. They knew what the schools were like. They knew the families that were there.
But another thing that’s happened post-2000 is that a lot of folks who ended up in the suburbs didn’t move by choice. The central city got too expensive. So the rents and tenements that used to be accessible to low-income people, those got snapped up. In Detroit they got turned into downtown lofts. And many low-income people started to move outside the city because that’s where affordable housing was.
So what are some of the challenges that schools have when they experience this type of demographic change?
We hold in our imagination that schools in the suburbs are good and schools in the city are bad. My first question is always, “For whom are suburban schools good?” Are Black students experiencing high-quality education? Are they gaining access to the best classes in the school? Are they being suspended at a proportional rate to white students? And sadly, the answer is no. As we look at increasing shares of groups like Latinx folks, it becomes a complicated portrait. Why? No. 1, some areas have a history of Latinx presence, and so you may be talking about California, where people are starting to move from cities into more suburban areas, but there’s a familiarity with that population. So in a place like Orange County, they may quickly develop appropriate language services and other support.
In suburbs that are more diverse, that have white folks, Black folks, Asian folks, Latinx folks, multiracial folks, you’ll sometimes find competition for resources. Who actually gets to drive what’s happening inside schools? Do we have a curriculum that actually features the full kaleidoscope here? Or does one group get a disproportionate share? What happens when you have to make trade-offs between hiring more folks for translation and more folks who are reading coaches for native English speakers? Those are the things that happen in real time and oftentimes don’t get discussed.
Loudoun County, a suburb in Virginia, was at the center of Glenn Youngkin’s messaging against critical race theory in schools. How do you think the growing minority presence in suburban schools that used to be mostly white and are controlled by white school boards has played into the national panic over these ideas?
We know that the panic around critical race theory is really a lightning rod to activate conservative folks who desire a throwback to yesterday. It’s similar to when Donald Trump was on the campaign trail and stoked fears about building affordable housing in the suburbs and the types of people it would attract. It’s an appeal to a time in which segregation was normal and unquestioned.
This signal is meant to activate, in particular, white folks who remain in the suburbs. We know that now, in the nation’s largest metropolitan areas, the majority of Black residents live in the suburbs. Now the majority of immigrants live in the suburbs. Now the majority of Latinx and Asian Americans live there. But most news media, when they say “suburban,” they mean “white.”
So we have to be specific about whom we’re talking about. And if we continue to think of the suburbs as only white, we never ask suburban Black mothers or suburban Asian mothers what they actually think about these politics. Unfortunately, we have been trained to say, “If white women are thinking about this as an issue, this is the voice of the suburbs.” And frankly, it’s not. Because we see time and time again, as you actually speak to these residents, a lot of folks in the suburbs who are of color immediately saw through the hubbub about critical race theory as dog whistling.
But it also raises the question of what coalition politics are going to look like. So many folks have assumed, because the suburbs are becoming more Black, more brown, more poor, that they’re just going to vote straight-line Democrat. And I think when we look, we actually see that there are moments in which the Republican Party has made significant inroads in terms of mobilizing suburban voters of color. It varies significantly by racial and ethnic group. Black folks remain solidly Democratic in the suburbs.
Latinx folks, it depends a lot on the geography. Asian American folks, again, it depends a lot on the geography and the ethnicity at hand. So for us to think about critical race theory and the suburbs, we have to think about how the suburbs came to be. We have to think about how this is a signal and not assume that as we have an increasing share of people of color and poor folks in the suburbs, that they’re necessarily going to vote Democratic.
In your work, you talk to parents in the suburbs. What do you think is driving some of these shifts toward the right in suburban communities of color? What are people telling you?
Part of the work is understanding that people who have had a chance to opt for the suburbs — meaning they had the means and they chose — they are often trying to curate a particular kind of life. So when you talk about social policies that expand the safety net, when you talk about policies that put race at the center of discussion, this is, in some cases, a misunderstanding of the reality in the suburbs. Many suburban residents of color have tried to assimilate and buy into a notion that we don’t have to talk about race. Many residents, across race, have said one of the reasons they left the city was because of the safety net — the safety net was a burden that took more taxes away from them.
There are now more poor people in suburbs than in central cities, which means these problems have cropped back up for these same suburban residents. They have to reckon with the thing that they tried to escape.
What are the actual harms that take place because of this misunderstanding of suburbs?
One of the things I think that people underestimate is just the depth of violence. So even as we watched the Black Lives Matter movement emerge, many of those killings were happening in the suburbs. In fact, some estimates suggest that more people are killed by police in the suburbs than in cities. And cities have had a lot of conversation about police reform. Now, I don’t necessarily think those have gotten that far, but in many of these suburban districts, there’s never even been a conversation.
More folks are now in the suburbs who don’t align with how a law officer thinks someone should look. So maybe you look like you don’t belong in this neighborhood. Racial profiling has a long history in the United States.
When we think about supports and social services, most of us think about the needs of poor people living in the city. And so what does it mean to be located in Larchmont, N.Y., and to be a nonnative English speaker and to be low income and to not have resources around finding adequate food, adequate income, adequate immigration support? And to say the only way you can do that is to travel an hour and a half into New York City? You start to see people floating in space.
Here’s one thing I’m genuinely puzzled by. These demographic shifts are not new. And yet the image of the suburban school as this white place with white students and maybe a couple of Asians thrown in there persists. Why?
So in the summer of 2020, as folks started to talk about defunding the police and abolition, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asked, “What does defunding the police look like? What does it really mean?” And she responded, “It looks like a suburb.”
I was particularly struck because she grew up in a suburb and she wasn’t white in that suburb. The pull is so deep to use “suburban” as shorthand for “white and moneyed.” And that shorthand allows us to talk about a lot of racial dynamics in politics, but it doesn’t actually capture what’s happening.
We’re going to be forced to reckon with where people are because the narrative has been marching along for 20 years. We just haven’t been paying attention. You hear it arise more and more around elections, but you’re going to see it when we try to figure out how to deal with national poverty, with food insecurity, with transportation and infrastructure. Because the conversation has exclusively assumed people of color are in cities and white folks are in the suburbs. So I hope that people get shaken out of that misconception. But I think we have another 20 years before that happens."

When Talking About Identity, How Much Do Words Matter?
By Michael Gonchar and Callie Holtermann

Language has always had power. Words can hurt, offend and provoke, but they can also empower, uplift and inspire. They can even change culture. Language has always evolved, and that is certainly true for language related to race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.
Words and terms like BIPOC, P.O.C., she/her, he/him, they/them, nonbinary, LGBTQIA+, antiracism, white privilege and microaggression might have been unfamiliar to most people even a decade ago. “African American” is sometimes being superseded by “Black,” with a capital “B.” The term “queer” has been reclaimed by some, but still reads as hate speech to others. And debates erupt over whether to use Latinx or Latino for people of Latin American descent.
Have you noticed this kind of evolving language within your school community? How careful are you with the language you use to discuss identity and social issues? Do you think this debate over language is a meaningful social justice imperative, or does it miss what is most important: substantive policy changes?
In “BIPOC or POC? Equity or Equality? The Debate Over Language on the Left,” Amy Harmon writes:
In California, a Black college freshman from the South is telling a story about his Latino friends from home when he is interrupted by a white classmate. “We say ‘Latinx’ here,” he recalls her saying, using a term he had not heard before, “because we respect trans people.”
In Philadelphia, Emma Blackson challenges her white neighbor’s assertion that Black children misbehave in school more than others. “It’s just my implicit bias,” the neighbor offers, saying that she had recently learned the phrase.
In Chicago, Kelsey O’Donnell, 31, wonders why colleagues and friends have suddenly started saying “BIPOC,” an acronym that encompasses individuals who are Black, Indigenous or other people of color. Where had it come from? “There was really nobody to ask,” says Ms. O’Donnell, who is white. “It was just, ‘This is what we say now.’”
Americans have always wrestled with language when it comes to describing race, with phrases and vocabulary changing to meet the struggles and values of the moment. But especially in the wake of protests for social justice in the summer of 2020, there is a heightened attention to this language, say scholars and activists, as some on the left try to advance changes in the culture through words.
“You can’t change what you can’t name,” Cathy Albisa, vice president of institutional and sectoral change at the racial justice nonprofit Race Forward, said.
For some people, though, the new lexicon has become a kind of inscrutable code, set at a frequency that only a narrow, highly educated slice of the country can understand, or even a political litmus test in which the answers continually change. Others feel disappointment, after so many protests last summer demanded far deeper change on issues like criminal justice and voting rights.
Students, read the entire article, and then tell us:
What is your reaction to this article? What do you think about the debate over “language on the left”? Why?
Are you highly conscious of the words you use when discussing race, gender and sexuality? Do you ever start discussions about language or about the labels or pronouns that resonate most with you?
Are there words used to describe elements of your identity that you are more comfortable with than others? Are there words or terms used in your community that, even though they are intended to be empowering, make you uncomfortable or confused?
Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, said, “When you’ve been on the margin, being able to claim a language and a narrative and a set of words to express yourself is incredibly important.” Do you agree?
Kelsey O’Donnell, 31, of Chicago said, “I’m exhausted by the constant need to be wary or you’ll instantly be labeled racist or anti-trans.” Do you ever find language to be a minefield? In your community, what happens when someone uses the “wrong” word? Is there any reaction? If so, is the reaction proportionate to the offense? Why or why not?
Is the subject of language about race, gender and sexuality a sensitive issue in your community? Has any of the “language of the left” discussed in this article been embraced by the people you know? Or has there been a backlash against it?
Do you agree with those quoted in the article who consider this new attention to language a “dodge” — a way to avoid substantive policy changes, like investing in more affordable housing or quality education? Is this debate over language missing the point? Or do you think changes in language are a necessary step toward achieving justice? Why or why not?"

The Great ‘West Side Story’ Debate
By The New York Times

Since its Broadway premiere in 1957, “West Side Story” — a musical based on “Romeo and Juliet” and created by four white men — has been at once beloved and vexing.
The score, featuring such Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim classics as “Somewhere” and “Maria,” is considered one of the best in Broadway history. The cast album was a No. 1 smash. The 1961 movie won best picture and nine other Oscars. The show has been regularly revived, most recently on Broadway last year in a short-lived radical rethinking by the Belgian director Ivo van Hove. And now, this month, a movie remake by none other than Steven Spielberg.
And yet, from the beginning, the show (directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, with a book by Arthur Laurents) has discomfited some audience members and critics — for its violence, its mix of tones and, especially, for the way it underscores stereotypes of Puerto_Ricans as gang members. Not to mention that the 1961 movie featured the white actress Natalie Wood playing the Latina role of Maria.
Why does “West Side Story” continue to have such a large cultural footprint? Should it? Is it possible to be true to such richly emotional material and still be responsive to our moment?
We asked five experts to weigh in: Jesse Green, the chief theater critic at The New York Times; Isabelia Herrera, a Times critic fellow; Carina del Valle Schorske, a contributing writer at the Times Magazine and the author of a 2020 Times Opinion piece challenging the show’s place in the culture; the Tony Award-winning playwright Matthew López (“The Inheritance”); and Misha Berson, the author of “Something’s Coming, Something Good: ‘West Side Story’ and the American Imagination.”
They gathered before seeing the new film and just before news broke that Sondheim, the show’s lyricist and the last survivor from its creative team, had died at 91. Scott Heller, the interim editor of Arts & Leisure, kicked off the conversation, and it got going quickly from there.
SCOTT HELLER What stays with you about the first time you saw “West Side Story”? Or the most memorable time?
JESSE GREEN The first time I saw it was in a high school production featuring extremely clumsy dancing, warbly singing and an all-white (non-Latinx) cast. Memorable, but not in a good way. Luckily, I had already gotten to know it by then — from the music.
MATTHEW LÓPEZ My relationship to “West Side Story” is a bit unusual in that my father was in the film as an extra. He’s clearly visible in the opening scene on the playground, just after the prologue. When I was perhaps 7, my parents showed it to me, and it was incredibly exciting to see my father at 14 years old. And it was the first time I’d ever seen any kind of popular entertainment with Puerto_Rican characters. It was not until later that my relationship to the show changed. I saw the revival in 2009 (my first time seeing it onstage), and I was shocked at how thinly the Puerto_Rican characters were drawn.
MISHA BERSON I’m probably the one person here who saw the original — actually a Broadway tour that came through Detroit when I was 9 years old. I went with my dance class, and though it was something of a blur and I didn’t understand it much, I was captivated by the dancing, the music, the energy and excitement of the show. I became obsessed with it, but as an adult didn’t see another vibrant, fully realized production until the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle did an excellent revival in 2007.
ISABELIA HERRERA Unfortunately, my memories are wrapped up in a microaggression that has stayed with me since high school. My family is Dominican, from the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, and I am likely one of the only kids of Dominican descent who attended my high school. I remember when, in English class, a white classmate reprimanded me for not having seen “West Side Story” at the time, saying, “But aren’t you Puerto_Rican?!”
CARINA DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Ugh, Isabelia, that’s such a familiar story! In a messed-up way, your classmate’s confusion makes sense, because the musical itself might just as well be about Dominicans — it’s that general. I first saw “West Side Story” on a VHS tape my mom and I rented from the public library when I was maybe 9 or 10. I grew up in California, away from my Puerto_Rican family in Washington Heights, so I thought I might find something out about my culture that I didn’t know before. But nothing onscreen — beyond the latticework of fire escapes — reminded me of the people or neighborhood I knew from frequent visits to New York. I finished the movie feeling even more confused than I was before about what being Puerto_Rican was supposed to mean — to me, and to the “average” American.
GREEN I’ve never seen musicals as documentaries. They often rely on stereotypes to make larger points than they could if they focused on specific, actual characteristics. Without the stereotypes, you probably couldn’t have ensembles. The question is whether the stereotypes are vile, destructive. As a white, non-Latinx person, I’m not the right person to judge that. But I would just say that the Jets are stereotyped, too, and, in the source material, so are the Veronese.
BERSON Do you trust that everyone knows the source material is Shakespeare’s R&J? I wish I did!
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE “The Jets are stereotyped, too,” but white teens are not harmed by such stereotypes because there have always been such a wealth of representations to choose from. And at the time of the musical’s debut, there wasn’t a general suspicion in the air that any white teen might be a gangster, so “West Side Story” wasn’t, for them, reinforcing an expectation of criminality that was already violently shaping the politics of the period.
GREEN Would you say the Puerto_Rican characters are less well characterized than the white ones: the Poles, Italians and others? My sense is that most characters in most musicals are poorly characterized in terms of their ethnic or racial or other identity because that’s not what those shows are really about. Don’t get me started on gay and Jewish stereotypes in musicals, which I guess I’m especially aware of as a gay Jew.
BERSON The creators of the show, though they were all white men, were not simply oblivious to what actual Puerto_Ricans were like in New York at the time. For instance, Jerome Robbins visited Puerto_Rican youth dances and social gatherings, and tried to incorporate some of the popular dance movements he saw in his choreography. He also tried to recruit as many Latinx performers as possible, which was difficult because there were so few opportunities for them to get the Broadway experience and training the show demanded. Also, Bernstein had always loved and admired Latin music and tried to meld some of the rhythms into his score.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE That’s interesting, about Robbins. I’m quite familiar with a broad range of Latin rhythms, and I don’t hear or see the influence — unless you’re counting the Spanish paso doble on the rooftop. I do love some of the choreography, especially the anxious, tightly coiled “Cool,” performed by the Jets. It’s good to know that someone was at least trying to do their homework after Sondheim confessed he’d “never even met a Puerto_Rican.” In this conversation, I really hope we can move beyond the false binary: “documentary” versus “work of imagination.” Does a work of imagination really have to be so “superficial and sentimental,” which is how the Black Puerto_Rican journalist Jesús Colón described West Side Story when it debuted?
GREEN In musical theater, that isn’t a false binary. Some shows operate at a granular level, risking larger insignificance, and others work more broadly, risking stereotype. “West Side Story,” as Misha can tell us more definitively, was an idea looking for an ethnicity. And it does seem to me that in landing on Puerto_Ricans vs. whites (instead of Jews vs. Catholics as originally imagined), it was taking advantage of a news hook of the time without any deep engagement in Puerto_Rican-ness. I guess the question is whether it’s possible for a work to rise above that when it is primarily looking at the eternal paradigm of outsiders and insiders, and the tragedy of love that tries to cross those boundaries.
BERSON That is “Romeo and Juliet,” Jesse, which one could say (as you indicated) had little to do with the actual Verona (which Shakespeare never visited) but still is a potent portrayal of love in the crossfire of hate. I also want to add that though characters in musicals tend not to be deeply complex and contoured, Bernardo and Anita are not portrayed simply as bad kids spoiling for a fight. They are more sympathetic than that, as leaders and lovers, at least to my understanding — in some ways more so than Jets members.
And a moment of historical context may be helpful here: At the time of the show’s creation, there was national alarm about the growing “threat” of youth violence during the postwar malaise, and that was true of Black, Irish and other groups of kids. And there was also, among these liberal artists, a real concern about racial/ethnic prejudice and the rising backlash against immigrants of color. These things are still meaningful, and one of the reasons I think young people especially are still very much drawn to the material despite its flaws.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I would be more sympathetic to the possibility of “West Side Story” rising above that fault if its creators, or re-creators, were not taking advantage of Puerto_Ricans as the “news hook” for liberal street cred. If it’s supposed to be some universal and culturally interchangeable narrative, then it doesn’t get to count as a serious exploration of Puerto_Rican or so-called Latinx life.
GREEN I agree that “West Side Story” is not a serious exploration of those things. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a serious exploration of something else. I say this even though I don’t actually think it’s the greatest musical ever written; it has plenty of aesthetic flaws beyond the political ones we’re discussing. My love for it comes mostly from the way the songs tell the story — though I know that too is a point of contention. For me, Sondheim’s lyrics get at the twitchy excitement (and anger) of youth like nothing else in musical theater ever has — as do Bernstein’s polyrhythms and percussion, whatever their actual sonic origin.
HELLER Matthew, I’m going to circle back to you, as a theater artist whose response to the material has changed over time. Among other things, you wrote a play about the play and its impact on a Puerto_Rican family. Tell us about it — and was it informed by your new insights into where the original fell short?
LÓPEZ The movie did spark my nascent creative brain as a piece of drama — the music, the dancing — and as cinema. Seeing the revival, though, I realized how much the Puerto_Rican characters — and thereby the performers playing them — were not invited to the party, so to speak. A meal had been laid out and half the cast seemed left to go hungry. My family loved “West Side Story,” but as I thought about it, I realized their love for the show wasn’t reciprocated by it.
All of this led me to begin writing “Somewhere,” which is set in the neighborhood that was ultimately destroyed to build Lincoln Center. A Puerto_Rican family of dancers and performers who dream of being cast in “West Side Story” (or anything Jerome Robbins created) but who, by the realities of their situation, are only left dreaming. I think in some ways, I was attempting to tell the offstage story that you don’t see.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Matthew, it seems like “Somewhere” shows us how to engage with a “canonical” work without reproducing its limitations. I’m interested in the way Puerto_Rican artists have creatively navigated the musical’s constraints, but I’m also hungry for … anything else! In her memoir, Rita Moreno wrote about how difficult it was to find substantial roles after “West Side Story”: I’m kind of depressed by the fact that she’s still defined by the show in 2021. I mean, Moreno performed in plays by Lorraine Hansberry, she spent decades in psychoanalysis — doesn’t she deserve to grow?
LÓPEZ I do have to cop to a bifurcated mind on this. There’s a part of me that really loves “West Side Story” and a part of me that really hates that I love “West Side Story.” I think Lin-Manuel Miranda once called it “a blessing and a curse,” which is a sentiment I understand.
BERSON It makes total sense to have a conflicted opinion of the show, especially if it speaks to you so personally. It’s not equivalent, but as a Jewish woman, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” drives me up the wall! Meanwhile, I can readily imagine Latinx performers might both love and resent “West Side Story” — love the way it has given many employment and its exhilarating use of dancer-actor-singers, but resent it for all the reasons you, Carina and others have stated. Popular culture is often a double-edged sword that way.
GREEN New work from new artists is the lifeblood of the theater. Yet engaging with the old ones, which were new once, can also be pleasurable and valuable — unless they have become the equivalent of Confederate statues that need to come down. Is “West Side Story” a Confederate statue? I don’t think so.
BERSON If we are now designating imperfect musicals as Confederate statues, I think that’s scary. “West Side Story” gets produced a lot because it can accommodate a teenage cast (there have been thousands of high school productions) and because it is a kind of cultural touchstone that still excites people. Confederate statues glorify bigotry and apartheid. There’s a difference.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Audiences are taught what should resonate with them — nothing becomes a “cultural touchstone” by accident — and the more a certain narrative gets repeated, the more sentimental associations it accrues. “West Side Story” might not be a Confederate monument, but it is a monument to the authority of white Americans to dominate the conversation about who Puerto_Ricans are. And each revival renews that authority and co-signs the narrative for a new generation.
GREEN All art is political, yes, and deserves to be judged as such. But art is not just political, and deserves to be judged on other grounds, too. If there is no pleasure to be had in “West Side Story” then it cannot possibly overcome the problems we’re discussing. But if it does offer pleasure, then we, as individuals, are free to weigh it against those problems. The balance will be different for different people, not necessarily corresponding with identity.
HELLER Matthew, you and I had some provocative back-and-forths about critical responses to “The Inheritance” and its depictions of the gay community, and you were good enough to write a piece for us, in which you made this point: “No one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives.” Does that hold for “West Side Story” as well
LÓPEZ I don’t think it’s an apt comparison. “The Inheritance” is a gay play written by a gay man whereas “West Side Story” is purported to be about Puerto_Ricans and was written by white men. And while there are heterosexual characters in “The Inheritance,” they aren’t serving the same dramatic function in my play that the Puerto_Rican characters do in “West Side Story.” And I used the word “function” purposefully, for that is what they feel in the story. I’d love to see a “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”-style rethinking one day.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I agree that any future engagement with “West Side Story” that actually deepens the material would have to abandon all loyalty to the show as written, the way “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern” completely reimagines “Hamlet.” It’s an independent work of art that deconstructs the canonical play. I doubt the creators of “West Side Story” gave a single thought to “new narratives” that might emerge from their musical, let alone new Puerto_Rican narratives. And it doesn’t seem like the power brokers of Broadway or Hollywood are really thirsting for them, otherwise the same material wouldn’t get recycled over and over.
HELLER So we are getting to the Spielberg movie.
HERRERA I’m also skeptical of how much the thirst for new narratives comes from a genuine place, rather than a response to an industry that is clearly grappling with questions of racism and struggling to navigate critiques about representation. Honestly, I think there is something sinister about capitalizing on the nostalgia of a Hollywood artifact, casting an all-Latinx Sharks cast, while still using the liberal language of “inclusion” and “diversity” as armor against critique. The fact that “West Side Story” is being remade with these issues in mind doesn’t necessarily absolve it of its original missteps.
BERSON So is there no place for “West Side Story,” even with the best of intentions? Does that mean there’s no place for “Othello” or “Merchant of Venice,” which are problematic but still dramatically vital works? Can we still see the show, or not see it, and have fruitful debate about it?
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I’m not advocating the wholesale erasure of “West Side Story.” I’m saying, let’s stop pouring literally hundreds of millions of dollars into propping up its relevance, and let’s stop minimizing its flaws.
HERRERA Misha, I think we can certainly still have a fruitful debate about it! When discussions around colorism mushroomed online surrounding the film adaptation of “In the Heights,” I mentioned in our roundtable that criticism emerges from a place of love — a desire to make art, life and politics better. I don’t see these critiques as mutually exclusive.
BERSON That is very well said. And just my awareness of the politics of librettist Arthur Laurents and composer Leonard Bernstein especially — who were both blacklisted in the ’50s for their civil rights and other activism — makes me think they would probably share some of these concerns and find them meaningful. But the show has intrinsic artistic power, and I think will survive. It is encouraging to me that someone with the skill and sensitivity of Tony Kushner is the screenwriter/adapter. I hope it’s great, and I hope it’s the last!
HELLER Do others hope the remake is great?
HERRERA I don’t know if there is such a thing as a great remake, but I’m certainly hoping this version releases its grip on stereotypes, offers its more underdeveloped characters a bit of autonomy and perhaps provides more texture about the actual life and experiences of Puerto_Rican migration at the time. And please, give us at least a few songs with actual Afro-Caribbean rhythms! A plena take on “I Feel Pretty”?
GREEN Authenticity isn’t the goal; if “Hamilton” were authentic, it would be mostly minuets. I want the new movie of “West Side Story” to succeed if it’s good, if it manages to move people. But if only white people are moved, it will be a failure.
LÓPEZ I’m excited to see what Spielberg, Kushner and [the choreographer Justin] Peck do with the material for a 21st-century audience. It’s a perfect opportunity to honor what’s glorious about the show, and address what is flawed.
DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I want it to flop so we can move on."

The Words Democrats Use Are Not the Real Problem
By Jamelle Bouie

After Donald Trump and the Republican Party made gains among Black and Hispanic voters in the 2020 presidential election, a chorus of voices emerged to blame the outcome on Democratic messaging.
Democrats, went the argument, were too “woke,” too preoccupied with “identity politics,” too invested in slogans like “defund the police” and too eager to embrace the language of the activist left. Terms like “BIPOC” (an acronym for Black, Indigenous and People of Color) and especially “Latinx” alienated the working-class Black and Hispanic voters who shifted to Trump in key states like Florida and North Carolina.
It makes sense that this is where the conversation turned. People who work with words — journalists, commentators and political professionals — are naturally interested in the impact of messaging and language on voters.
At the same time, it is important to remember that language does not actually structure politics. Yes, a political message can persuade voters or, on the other end, help them rationalize their choices. And yes, a political message can be effective or ineffective. But we should not mistake this for a causal relationship.
The forces that drive politics are material and ideological, and our focus — when trying to understand and explain shifts in the electorate — should be on the social and economic transformations that shape life for most Americans.
With that in mind, let’s return to the debate over the Democratic Party’s declining fortunes with Hispanic voters. (In all of this, it is important to remember that even with the significant shift to Trump, who improved on his 2016 total in 2020 by 10 percentage points, according to Pew, Biden still won 59 percent of the Hispanic voters who cast ballots.)
Does a term like “Latinx” alienate some portion of the Hispanic voting public? A recent survey says yes. According to a new national poll of Hispanic voters, only 2 percent chose the term to describe their ethnic background, and 40 percent said it offends them either “a lot” (20 percent), “somewhat” (11 percent) or “a little” (9 percent). To the extent that Democratic politicians and affiliated voices used the term — demonstrating their distance from the communities in question — that may have left a bad taste in the mouths of some Hispanic voters. But it does not follow from there that use of the term explains anything about electoral trends among Hispanics. For those, we have to look at the material and ideological shifts I mentioned earlier.
It would be too much for a single column to give a full inventory of those changes. But I can point to a few. First, there is the economy. In areas like the Rio Grande Valley of Texas — where Republicans made major inroads with Mexican American voters in 2020 — rising wages for workers in the region’s oil and gas industry helped shift some voters to the right. Nationally, there’s evidence that some Hispanic voters credited Trump with wage growth and rewarded him with additional support. In general, upward mobility and a greater sense of integration into the mainstream of American society have made a significant number of Hispanic voters more open to Republican appeals.
Playing a similar role is evangelical religion. As my news-side colleague Jennifer Medina noted in an article last year, “Hispanic evangelicals are one of the fastest growing religious groups in the country.” Churches remain important sites for political socialization, and evangelicalism is, at this juncture, a conservative force in American culture and politics. It makes sense, then, that Hispanic evangelicals are also much more likely than their Catholic counterparts to vote Republican.
According to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, “Hispanic Protestants” were more likely than all other Hispanics to approve of Trump’s performance as president, his handling of the economy, his handling of “racial justice protests” and his handling of the pandemic. Hispanic Protestants were also much more likely to say that “Christians face a lot of discrimination.”
There is also the longstanding effort by Republicans to mobilize Hispanic conservatives for the Republican Party. “For the past half century,” the historian Geraldo Cadava writes in “The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, from Nixon to Trump,” “Hispanic Republicans and the Republican Party have been deliberate and methodical in their mutual, sometimes hesitant, embrace.” Beliefs about relations with Latin America, about “the United States as the protector of freedom in the world” and about “market-driven capitalism as the best path to upward mobility” have helped Republicans build a durable bulwark among Hispanic voters, one that the Trump campaign built on with focused and sustained outreach.
Entangled in these social and economic transformations is a longstanding and potent American ideology that slots some people as “makers” and others as “takers,” to use Mitt Romney’s off-the-cuff language to donors during his presidential campaign in 2012. Although traditionally associated with whiteness and masculinity, this “producerism” holds sway and currency across the electorate. That’s part of why candidates in both parties scramble to associate themselves with blue-collar workers and why some Democratic proponents of the social safety net insist that their policies provide a “hand up, not a handout.”
I think that a part of Donald Trump’s appeal, especially for men, was the degree to which he embodied the producerist ideal. His image, at least, was of the commanding provider, who generated wealth and prosperity for himself and others. Put another way, the prevalence of producerist ideology in American society helped frame Trump — previously the star of “The Apprentice” — as a political figure, making him legible to millions of Americans. Hispanic voters were as much a part of that dynamic as any other group.
The point here is not to write an exhaustive explanation of what happened among Hispanic voters in the 2020 presidential election. The point is that our constant battles over language are more distracting than not. The whys of American politics have much more to do with the ever-changing currents of race, religion and economic production than they do with political messaging. And no message, no matter how strong on the surface, will land if it isn’t attentive to those forces and the other forces that structure the lives of ordinary people."

Expanding the Scope of ‘Latin American Art’
By Holland Cotter

You don’t need to know anything about art to be stopped in your tracks by what’s on the walls of El Museo del Barrio these days: the fantastic ballpoint pen drawings by Consuelo (Chelo) González Amézcua (1903-1975), a Mexican immigrant to Texas; the stupefyingly intricate collages of Felipe Jesus Consalvos, who was born in Havana and died in Philadelphia, where in 1983 his life’s work was found in a garage sale; and the pictographic paintings of Puerto_Rican-born Eloy Blanco (1933-1984), who came to New York City to study art and learned from fellow Latinos about the Indigenous Taino culture of his homeland — a culture he ended up making the wellspring of his work.
This season has brought a bounty of historical shows of Latin American and Latino art, two cultural categories that are closely related without being interchangeable. Latin American is generally understood to designate art originating in the southern hemisphere of the Americas. Latino (with its Latina and Latinx cognates) refers to work by artists of Latin American descent working in the United States. But both terms are spacious and mutable.
El Museo del Barrio
The two meet in a pair of exhibitions at El Museo del Barrio. The larger, “Popular Painters and Other Visionaries,” spotlights work by 35 artists — González Amézcua, Consalvos and Blanco among them — born in the first half of the 20th century. Most are from Latin America; and many are self-taught, which means that much of the work doesn’t adhere to the mainstream market definition of “Latin American art” as work influenced, and elevated, by an association with elite European modernism.
Organized by El Museo curators Rodrigo Moura and Susanna V. Temkin, the show offers a counterargument from the start, with a display of three banners, glinting with sequins, and embroidered with mystical symbols. They were made by Antoine Oleyant (1955-1992), a Vodou priest from Haiti, and represent a distinctive local art tradition, one with clear Afro-Atlantic sources.
Other pieces, many culled from El Museo’s permanent collection, support the case for an expanded view of Latin American art, one that incorporates 1950s paintings of Yoruba myths by Rafael Borjes de Oliveira, a Brazilian policeman and Candomblé devotee, along with Asilia Guillén’s stitch-fine depictions of scenes from Nicaraguan history; but also the work of Latinx artists like Consalvos and Blanco, who were born in Latin America but spent their creative years in the United States.
Consalvos is thought to have died around 1960, on the cusp of a decade of intense Latino activism in North American cities, in reaction to racist neglect and aggression. As always, New York’s Puerto_Rican community had to see to its own survival, which included preserving its history. To this end, in 1974, three young photographers — Charles Biasiny-Rivera, Roger Cabán and Felipe Dante — formed En Foco, a collective devoted to documenting Latino life from the inside. And the second exhibition at El Museo, “En Foco: The New York Puerto_Rican Experience, 1973-1974,” displays the group’s inaugural portfolio, made up of images of daily life in the streets and schools of the barrio, and among Latino laborers in and outside the city.
Taller Boricua
In 1969, another volunteer grassroots start-up, Taller Boricua, also called the Puerto_Rican Workshop, set up shop in a public school classroom. It’s still in operation and maintains a modest gallery in the Julia de Burgos Latino Cultural Center at 106th Street and Lexington Avenue, where a founder, the artist Marcos Dimas, has installed a not-to-be-missed show.
It’s titled “Temporal Chronology,” and that’s exactly what it is: a year-by-year timeline of the Workshop’s history mapped out on the gallery walls in hundreds of pieces of printed ephemera: exhibition posters, letters, protest signs, newspaper clips. The wraparound archive also doubles as a half-century document of unbroken community activism, which persists even as the community changes. And it’s a personal record of Dimas’s career as artist-worker and political witness. (What’s on the walls has been stored in his apartment.) The city should honor him with a medal, and give Taller Boricua an extra shot of funding.
Americas Society
Dimas’s name gets a mention in an ambitious group exhibition called “This Must Be the Place: Latin American Artists in New York, 1965-1975” at Americas Society.
The narrative here is of artists from South and Central America coming to New York City, a newly hot international cultural center, some to explore career opportunities, others to escape political repression. Most didn’t think of themselves on arrival particularly as “Latin American,” never mind “Latino.” And while the show acknowledges the longtime presence of Latino artists in the city, there seems to have little interchange between them and the newcomers.
Race and class played a role in this, and differing senses of investment in the city. To Latino artists it was both home and battleground. To Latin American transplants it was a stage where a politics of aesthetics was playing out in new avant-garde styles and forms: Minimalism, Conceptualism, video and performance. And what extraordinary artists the experiments brought to New York: temporarily, Hélio Oiticica from Brazil, Marta Minujín from Argentina, Zilia Sánchez Dominguez from Cuba; permanently, Luis Camnitzer from Uruguay, Juan Downey from Chile, Freddy Rodríguez from the Dominican_Republic.
They are among some 40 artists and collectives in the show, organized by the Americas Society curator Aimé Iglesias Lukin, with Mariana Fernández, Tie Jojima and Natalia Viera Salgado — which comes in two parts, one through this Saturday, Dec. 18, the other, with different work by the same artists, opening Jan. 22.
The Galleries
Work by Latin American artists who produced art in the United States can also be found in galleries. A small show called “José Antonio Fernández-Muro: Geometry in Transfer” at the Institute for Studies on Latin American Art (ISLAA), on the Upper East Side, surveys work from the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Argentine artist moved, with his wife, the painter Sarah Grilo, to New York from Buenos Aires. In South America he was associated with an ethereal and utopian strain of geometric abstraction. In New York, the quietist impulse hit a bump: paintings were based on rubbings he made of Manhattan sewer grates and manhole covers. The show, organized by Megan Kincaid, an instructor at New York University, gives us both before and after work, equally beautiful.
Also on the Upper East Side, Henrique Faria Gallery, which specializes in Latin American art, is showing work by the Swiss-born Venezuelan photographer Luis Molina-Pantin, who calls himself “an urban archaeologist.” On visits to New York from 2001 to 2006, he photographed (with a hidden camera) the back room offices of big-deal Chelsea galleries, sterile, high-ceilinged, art-free spaces that suggest mortuaries. During the same decade, disguised as a real estate agent, he was shooting Disneyesque drug-baron mansions in Colombia, one a miniature version of the Taj Mahal. In the show, it’s hard to decide which version of power architecture is weirder.
And a few blocks away, at Hunter College’s Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Gallery, “Life as Activity: David Lamelas” is celebrating the career of the veteran Argentina-born conceptualist, focusing on two of his films. The longer one, “The Desert People,” is a rough and interesting pseudo-documentary about researching Native American life, made in 1974 in Los Angeles. “The Invention of Dr. Morel” was made in Europe in 2000. It’s polished and spooky and has a hologram — a kind of proto-NFT? — for a heroine. The exhibition was developed by students in a Hunter graduate seminar led by Harper Montgomery, a professor, with the artist participating via Zoom.
Hunter College is home to the invaluable Center for Puerto_Rican Studies (Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños). And the Hunter East Harlem Gallery at 119th Street and Third Avenue has given significant exposure to Latino art, as it is doing now with “Lina Puerta: Migration, Nature, and the Feminine,” a compact midcareer survey of sculpture by an artist raised in Colombia and created during her time as an East Harlem resident. Puerta’s assemblages, with their fake tropical greenery, faux fur, lace, rhinestones and sexualized forms, represent the exoticism that some Latin American Conceptualists were rejecting, but that has, in Puerta’s hands, a critical politics (eco-feminist, anti-colonialist) of its own. As conceived by Klaudia Ofwona Draber and Arden Sherman (the gallery’s director), the show is too much, and proud.
A final strong exhibition is far downtown at South Street Seaport, in a new gallery named Calderón. Its debut show features two New York painters, Shellyne Rodriguez and Danielle De Jesus, who focus on the different Latino worlds they’ve been part of.
De Jesus spent her childhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and paints memory-portraits of people there. Many lived and died in poverty, or were pushed out of their homes as real estate values rose. Rodriguez grew up in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Her color pencil drawings are portraits too, but they’re not sad; they’re sassy. And in compositions based on vintage hip-hop fliers, figures are surrounded by words: song lyrics, advertising slogans, Bronx street names, quotes from Frantz Fanon. This is a world that may partly exist in the past, but it’s jumpily noisy, and still alive.
Latino/Latina/Latinx continues to defy easy definition, but attempts to do so keep coming, the latest being the Winter 2021 “Latinx” issue of Aperture magazine, guest-edited by Pilar Tompkins Rivas. In 17 essays it circles and probes the subject from many angles. What comes through in the end is not consensus but a kind of wild richness. Why try to pin down, and narrow, a concept that has, after all, always contained multitudes?"

Latino Voters Are Key to 2024, and They’re Not Always Buying What Democrats Are Selling
By Geraldo L. Cadava

The shift toward Donald Trump by Latino voters was one of the more surprising takeaways of the 2020 presidential election. The findings of recent polls and reports — that Latinos may still be sliding toward Republicans — are even more disconcerting for Democrats. Given the political stakes as well as the stakes for Latino families, Democratic leaders must do better.
As 2022 begins, the party so far has no visible, convincingly powerful plan to win over the voters many rank and file Democrats believe are key to November’s midterm elections, the 2024 presidential race and perhaps the future of the Democratic Party. But what happens next, when Democratic candidates fan out across the country trying to shore up support from Latinos who may be slipping away?
Some believe that doing better means spending more money on messaging, advertising and outreach. But this isn’t the only lesson to be gleaned from what the data is telling us, and it might not even be the right one. Democrats should more aggressively combat Republican messaging with their own, but the real fight should be over which party has the best ideas on education, immigration, jobs and the economy. This is where Democrats take the Latino vote for granted, but they shouldn’t.
Daniel Garza, the president of the conservative group The Libre Initiative, for example, believes that the Republican agenda gives his party the upper hand with Latinos. He scoffed at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announcement last November that it planned to win back Latino and other voters of color by spending at least $30 million to hire organizers, pay for targeted advertising campaigns, combat disinformation and support voter protection and education programs.
Thirty million is a lot of money, he told me, but it would be “wasted if the message were about nuanced topics like voter suppression, disinformation and diversity.” The problem for Democrats, he added, is that “G.O.P. ideas are better” because they’re “pro-growth, pro-energy, pro-parent (school choice) and pro-advancement.”
Mr. Garza makes several assumptions: that voter suppression and disinformation are nuanced topics that don’t resonate with Latinos, that Democrats aren’t fighting for policies that will make our lives better and that the Republican Party is the only one that supports growth and families.
Some Democrats have downplayed the importance of policy compared with style and approach. Chuck Rocha, a political strategist, who is in a way Mr. Garza’s liberal counterpoint, called the re-election campaign announcement by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas at a Hispanic Leadership Summit a “brilliant political move,” but said that the Republican Party’s policies prove that they don’t care about Latinos. Mr. Rocha added that Democrats need to “quit taking a policy book” to a “fistfight.” He might be right that Democrats should be ready to fight, but they should absolutely bring their policy book with them.
Indeed, one of the main findings of the post-mortem report on the 2020 election published by Equis Research was that Donald Trump made inroads with Latino voters because he and Republican governors kept the economy open during the pandemic, cut taxes, distributed stimulus checks, secured the border and expedited vaccine development. I would add Mr. Trump’s focus on religious liberty and support for charter schools.
The report dispelled theories that Latinos supported Mr. Trump because they opposed the term “Latinx” and defunding the police, or because they aspire to whiteness. The problem with these assumptions is that they caricatured Latinos as motivated primarily by culture wars instead of sincerely held policy beliefs.
Or, rather, the term “Latinx,” policing and whiteness were issues with underlying policy implications that too often got framed as divisive culture wars and in ways that minimized the real policy disagreements they highlighted for Latinos: generational divides between Latino Democrats over progressive versus moderate policies, whether the border patrol or police help or harm communities and whether capitalism, however exploitative, or socialism, however invasive, is the best path toward upward mobility and economic security.
The notion that Latinos were swayed by disinformation implies that they could be duped into voting for Mr. Trump or that they could have voted for him only if they were duped. Sure, calling President Biden a socialist is disinformation because he is not a socialist. But it’s also the same line of attack that Republicans have used to brand their opponents for a long time. We should be outraged with the lies, and we should combat them. But by merely dismissing the attack as disinformation, we ignore why it has been so successful.
It’s not just that socialism conjures ghosts of Latin America’s leftist leaders. It’s also an argument about religion — since conservatives consider socialism a godless philosophy — the ills of government intervention and dependency on government, and education. In a society that cherishes freedom, parents should have a hand in deciding what their children learn.
As much as Democrats would like to dismiss Republican talking points — or misinformation, in some cases — they would be better off understanding how they relate to values that in turn connect with policy preferences. Then they can work to persuade Latinos that their policies are better, even on issues such as religion, the economy and education, on which Republicans claim to occupy more solid ground.
Latino voters aren’t empty vessels just waiting to be filled with liberal beliefs. The problem with focusing only, or even primarily, on messaging and outreach is that it once again doesn’t take Latinos seriously as political actors, and instead assumes that they’re out there ready to be mobilized for the Democratic cause. That’s just not true.
In the end, even if Democrats focus exclusively on policy, they still won’t sway all Latinos to vote for them. But doing so would help them better understand these voters. They should be asking them whether they are paid enough to provide for their families, if they’re satisfied with the schools their children go to, whether they have access to health care, and what government can do to help them reach their goals.
The concrete plans they develop in response, especially for families living paycheck to paycheck and worrying about schools and health care, should respect their work ethic and ambitions. Latinos aren’t looking for “handouts,” but rather, leveling the playing field by, for example, making it easier to get loans to start a business, and increasing access to higher education.
I dream of vigorous town hall-style debates where both parties engage in arguments over whose policies are best, instead of hurling talking points in our general direction from a distance. What Democrats learn may be uncomfortable if they have to abandon their assumptions. But dissecting our understanding of these voters, long presumed to represent a bloc, will be necessary if we have any hope of reconstituting “the Latino vote” in a way that’s more reflective of Latinos’ hopes, dreams and political aims."

English Is a Living Language — Period
By John McWhorter

I love it whenever I see it: “‘Free Pickup and Delivery,’” “‘Fresh Fish’” and the like.
I refer to signage on which quotation marks are used to indicate neither quotation nor irony but just upbeat promotional emphasis, as if the quotation marks were substitutes for capital letters, or perhaps jazz hands.
For years, when I lived in Jersey City, I was delighted every time I passed a neighborhood laundromat that had “CAROLINA’S” — including the quotation marks — emblazoned across its facade, almost as if there were something hypothetical about its washing machines and dryers. (I was saddened to learn that the building had a fire a few years ago.) These days, occasionally one reads a handwritten sign saying, “Please put on a mask,” with quotation marks and all. Or, my favorite example, on the Upper West Side in the early aughts, was a corner grocery that beckoned patrons to come in and “CREATE ‘A’ SALAD.” I assumed the proprietors meant the “A” as indicating excellence.
One senses that this usage of quotation marks is sometimes a matter of nonnative speakers creatively reworking English conventions, and sometimes it’s a reflection of the reality that written and spoken language is driven by everyday usage as much as by the strictures of elementary-school teachers, newspaper editors and professional grammarians.
And I love it.
I’ve long thought of this use of quotation marks as something that should be embraced as a permissible norm. Quotation marks have evolved to encompass a new function — somewhere at the intersection of italics, exclamation points and diacritics — in contrast to what quotation marks most likely mean to some readers of this newsletter. This kind of garden-variety metamorphosis is as ordinary as the hypereducated, woke register in which terms such as “Latinx” and “BIPOC” (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) are established, yet are not catching on beyond. And fine if they don’t — the woke register includes Latinx and BIPOC; the vernacular register includes quotation marks as emphasis. No problem, I say.
Undoubtedly, some would say that there is a problem, and it is that I, as a linguist, am so open — too open — to throwing out the rule book. I get that sentiment, but my flexibility on such things is because of how things have always gone. Exhibit A: the period.
You’d be forgiven if you assumed that a period has always meant finality at the end of a sentence. But its history is more complicated: In the “Old New York” depicted by Edith Wharton and Henry James and in the new HBO Max series “The Gilded Age,” in this same metropolitan area where, today, you can catch the emphatic quotation marks as you look around you, if you look upward, at fading old advertisements and such, often you can see what we could call the “advertising period.”
When one Jersey City building, once a factory, was converted into a luxury home, the original signage was preserved, with the all-caps line “PATTERN MAKERS.” — including the period, despite this two-word label not being a complete sentence.
This wasn’t unusual in 19th-century America. An 1860 rendering in Harper’s Weekly of a building in Lower Manhattan depicts a sign that reads “HATS CAPS & FURS.” — including, again, the period. An 1862 drawing portrays a cluster of posted bills hawking “Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup.” “ALLCOCK’S POROUS PLASTERS.” and “PYLE’S ‘O.K.’ SOAP.” — all with an advertising period, the last with a period and quotation marks for emphasis. This use of periods was common enough in advertisements of the era that I’ll be grading the, um, period authenticity of “The Gilded Age” partly on that basis.
Let’s not even get into differing opinions about the semicolon. Cecelia Watson wrote a book-long tribute to its delicate mediation between the divisiveness of the period and the lank hiccup of the comma. But Kurt Vonnegut once aired his leery sense that while the semicolon may have its place, to an extent its use merely shows that its user went to college. There is always a haziness about punctuational etiquette that undercuts the value of ready commandments.
The crowning example, motivating my laissez-faire take on quotation marks, is the Oxford comma, also known by its more quotidian moniker, the serial comma. You know: “Philadelphia, Berkeley, and New York” rather than “Philadelphia, Berkeley and New York.”
Yes, failing to use it can create confusion now and then. Suppose union rules deny you, a delivery driver, overtime pay for “the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of” such things as agricultural produce. Are you denied overtime pay for packing things for shipping and distribution, but eligible for overtime pay for just distribution? Only a comma after “shipment” could tell us definitively.
There was a case that hinged on just this, and the drivers won their demand to be paid for distribution alone. But at times, the Oxford comma can confuse matters. The Chicago Manual of Style’s online FAQs addresses the scenario of a phrase that goes something along the lines of “To my mother, Mother Teresa, and the Pope.” Is Mother Teresa, in that instance, your mother? Most of the time, context makes it clear what is meant, which is why the imposition of the Oxford comma varies so randomly. This newspaper’s stylebook doesn’t call for it in most cases. An especially influential guide in favor is Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style,” but to my recollection that book needlessly steers us away from things like using “chair” as a verb.
It’s difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Oxford comma is essentially a matter of what you consider to be ducks in a suitable row. Certainly, one could use it where clarity demands it, for instance, when the word “and” appears more than once in a series — when the dessert choices are “candy, cookies, and cake and ice cream” — but those who seem to insist on using an Oxford comma in the 99 percent of cases in which it isn’t necessary almost ask for transgression. The quest to get everyone to write “Philadelphia, Berkeley, and New York” is as Sisyphean as seeking for everyone to check his or her car’s oil level every month.
Are we not rather too easily given to rules allowing us to look down on other people? Being unreachably persnickety about such things is, in some ways, one of the last openly permissible prejudices, a kind of classism that’s frequently given a pass. (BuzzFeed’s 2019 listicle mocking emphatic quotation marks was almost too predictable.)
Therefore, I process emphatic quotation marks as an innovation rather than a bastardization. If Gilded Age folk accepted “‘PATTERN MAKERS.’” then “‘Fresh Fish’” should pass muster with us moderns."

Willy Chavarria Represents
By Guy Trebay

There is a thought that is never far from mind at a Willy Chavarria show like the one held on Friday at the Prince George Ballroom in the Flatiron district of Manhattan — under hot lights and in a haze of incense laced with the aroma of weed. And that thought is how in mainstream culture people are so often shrunken or displaced or miniaturized or marginalized until they become invisible even to themselves.
Mr. Chavarria’s latest show was titled “Uncut” and was a sequel to his “Cut Deep,” a spring 2022 show that seemed to establish beyond dispute Mr. Chavarria’s standing among the ranks of the most important designers at work today. There are many reasons to make that assertion, and not the least has to do with representation. For all of the shows he has staged in the years since he ventured out on his own after decades as an industry journeyman, Mr. Chavarria has imported to fashion a vision that encompasses the Latinx and L.G.B.T.Q. communities to which he belongs in all their glorious dispersion.
This would seem like a fairly straightforward objective. Yet at each Chavarria show the casts (assembled by Mr. Chavarria’s frequent collaborator, Brent Chua) are stubbornly unlike those on any other runway. Mr. Chavarria referred to the men in his most recent presentation as “hot” guys, and yet their hotness is of a kind rarely showcased on New York runways.
There were meaty, hulking types and paunchy types and hard femme types like the “Pose” actor Jason A. Rodriguez. There were conventional model types, too, and they were right there in the lineup alongside everyday people like Noe and Elias Zepeda, two of Mr. Chavarria’s young collaborators from Mexico and who have the sort of look encountered on the streets of Mexico City, though seldom on magazine covers.
“Fashion as a business has for years played off our insecurities,” Mr. Chavarria wrote in a text message after the show. “The entire industry was built on making people believe we need to buy clothes to uphold a certain perspective of beauty. I think one of the ways in which fashion is evolving is to shift the context of what beauty is into a more substantive concept.”
Representation, then, may be the more conspicuous dimension of Mr. Chavarria’s personal project, but it is only half the story. It is through the force of persistence and on the strength of pure design that Mr. Chavarria, who is 54, has muscled his way into a well-earned place in the history of American fashion. And he is bringing along his cohort as he does.
With his “Uncut’’ show, Mr. Chavarria continued to mine a vocabulary he has built up over the years, one richly informed by the experience of growing up amid immigrant subcultures and in a family of Mexican American field workers in California’s Central Valley. Its sly references — upside down USA logos, “W” pocket denims, blocky voluminous silhouettes, tweaked versions of all-black factory-floor workwear — to vernacular style, zoot suits and fixations in some Latinx communities with generic brands like American Eagle, True Religion and Nike thus worked as acts of homage and also of reclamation. (Two of the workwear outfits were a nod to a Chavarria collaboration with Dickies, due out later this year.)
In the designer’s hands, men’s wear staples like jeans, khakis, puffers and chore coats are supersized, reproportioned or given feminizing details like bracelet-length sleeves or skirting. Gender tropes in general are teased when the designer sends macho models with oiled chests sauntering onto the runway draped in cashmere overcoats or denim pullovers with immense stand-up collars or khaki boiler suits rendered as dresses.
“My role is to highlight beauty, strength, endurance, sex appeal as I see it,” the designer wrote. “Even with pockmarks and a pot belly.” Notably, three pieces — a navy sweater and pairs of khaki and of black trousers worn with satin boxer shorts peeping out of the waistband — from his gorgeous “Cut Deep” collection are prominently included in the Costume Institute’s refreshed blockbuster, “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” unveiled this week at the Met.
“The people in my show are friends, and they’re cast based on their character more than their height or their waistline,” Mr. Chavarria said. And character in general is an underrated element of design, one the fashion industry would do well to take more note of, he added. “It’s all so much stronger that way.”"
