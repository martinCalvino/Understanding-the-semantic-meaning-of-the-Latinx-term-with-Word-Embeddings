'Make America Mexico Again' cap flips the script on Trump
By Sonia Zuniga

While much of the country displayed their solidarity with Mexican people by wearing their biggest sombreros for Cinco de Drinko, a Chicano has made the best hat yet. 
A young Chicano from East L.A. decided to mix satire and a little bit of creativity by mocking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan and creating red caps reading ""Make America Mexico Again."" His latest activist-wear didn't receive much backlash as expected, but hundreds of order requests.
His GoFundMe page to sale his #YaBastaTrumpHat has raised more than $10,000 in 3 days.
Jerónimo Saldaña, a policy manager of legislation and organizing at the Drug Policy Alliance, is also an activist who previously worked on civic engagement and immigrant rights while serving as a program associate at the Open Society Foundations and New World Foundation.
""I thought that the parody on Trump's slogan would be popular and I can't wait to see our folks wearing it,"" Saldaña said on his fund page. ""Do you know another person who would want to buy the hat or would you want to get a 2nd one as a gift?""
According to Latina Magazine, getting stores to print the hats wasn't easy at first. When Saldaña walked into a Lids store in Manhattan and asked for the cap to be created, the manager refused, ""stating that the company refrains from recreating political slogans because it constitutes as a copyright violation.""
Big constitution lesson: making satirical clothing is acceptable under the First Amendment, according to FindLaw. 
Since then, Saldaña has gone to a Brooklyn-based independent distributor to make more hats. 
The ""Make America Mexico Again"" hat might be on to something when it comes to Texas.
If anybody needed a refresher, our state was known back then as Tejas, a province of Mexico between 1821 and 1836. It wasn't until March 2, 1836 that the Lone Star state declared its independence from Mexico, becoming the Republic of Texas.
Sam Houston and Texas forces defeated the Mexican soldiers in The Texas Revolution, which lasted from that October 1835 until the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. Officials later dedicated the San Jacinto Monument on April 21, 1939, to commemorate the battle that finally declared Texas independent from Mexico.
After gaining its independence, Texas held on to the idea that it would take a large chunk of the Territory of New Mexico. But as part of the treaty Texas agreed to in the Compromise of 1850, which maintained the balance of power between free and slave states, it ""relinquished claims to roughly 67 million acres in exchange for $10 million to pay off its debt,"" according to History's website. 
Trump once told The New York Times, that he believes America reached peak greatness in the 1900s or even the 1940s and 1950s. Some would point out those during those eras of American history minorities were getting the short end of the stick.
""(The United States) were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody,"" Trump said, ""we had just won a war, we were pretty much doing what we had to do.""
This week he tweeted a Cinco de Mayo message of how much he loved the Mexican food and those who make them. Backlashes went viral, from people questioning if taco bowls were even Mexican food, to the symbolism of his food choice. 
""Of course Donald Trump eats taco bowls, the only Mexican food that comes with a wall built around it,"" Vocativ's Deputy Editor Erin Gloria Ryan said in her post. 
All proceeds from the post-production and shipping of the cap will go to Mijente, a new political home for Latinx and Chicanx advocacy network, which is standing up against Trump and his hate filled agenda. Saldaña's goal is to get 400 orders.
This would surely be a great gift for you Latina mom. If you need more ideas for a gift, check out these 11 others items that would annoy the Republican candidate. 
""I want to focus our attention on flipping the script,"" Saldaña said to NBC News. ""[Trump's] supporters keep talking about building a wall, they're calling us rapists and thieves. There is nothing more powerful than satire and parody to change the tone of the conversation."""

Cepeda: It's time to dispatch with Hispanic Heritage Month
By Esther Cepeda

Thank goodness Hispanic Heritage Month is almost over. I'm not a fan, because who wants to be paid lip service for 30 days? And it's not even a proper full month, but the latter half of September and the early part of October.
Sure, several mid-September days mark the anniversaries of the independence of multiple Latin American countries, but that seems to have little to do with honoring the ""contributions Hispanics have made (to this country) throughout our history,"" according to this year's official White House proclamation.
Hispanics are nothing less than all-American constructs. Ironically, though, it's a classification that's mostly meaningful to non-Hispanics in the United States.
Check it out: Anywhere in the world my mom goes she is Mexican. My father, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived here longer than anywhere else, is, to others, forever from Ecuador. Me? No matter where in the world I go, I'm an American - except for in Latin America where I'm a ""gringa,"" which I'm perfectly comfortable with, thank you very much.
Here in the U.S., it's far more complicated. White, Asian and black non-Hispanics call us Latino, Hispanic, the teeth-grinding ""Latin,"" and sometimes even the cringe-inducing ""Spanish."" And if they're from California, they might whip out ""Chicano"" as well.
Generally there's been a years-long (and incredibly tiresome) back-and-forth among people with Latin American heritage about whether they should be identified as ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic."" As of last count - the Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project reported on this phenomenon in 2012 - a few of these people (21 percent, including me) were a minority-within-a-minority who identified as ""American.""
At that time, a majority (51 percent) of those with Latin American lineage said that they most often identify themselves by their family's country of origin. If they were pressed to pick between ""Hispanic"" and ""Latino,"" 33 per-cent (versus 14 percent) favored ""Hispanic.""
But in internet time, 2012 was practically the Stone Age, and we're way past simple binaries.
These days, label lovers fight over whether Hispanics should refer to themselves as the gender neutral or inclusive ""Latin@s"" or ""Latinx,"" two terms derived from ""Latino.""
In short order, those may be passe as well, if marketers have their way.
According to the trade publication MediaPost, ""ambiculturals"" are poised to become a hot new demographic. MediaPost, citing a Nielsen Co. research paper, recently described Hispanics who are 34 and under and bilingual as having ""a true ambiculturalism ... 'at once entirely American and entirely of one's culture of origin. Savvy marketers are taking notice and crafting dual-language communications that speak to both the American spirit and the Latino soul.'""
Targeting the ""Latino soul"" so they can sell it consumer goods? Give me a break.
Also contending for this mystical, young Latino soul are politicians. NBC Latino recently reported on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign outreach to ""bilennials,"" a portmanteau of ""bilingual"" and ""millennials.""
Spending precious time and resources talking about cutesy branding for a population with serious public policy concerns and a reputation for staying home on Election Day seems like fiddling while Rome burns.
Hispanic Heritage Month brings out the worst in big-name brands, and Hispanic journalists in this country spend a lot of time wisely emptying their inboxes of tone-deaf come-ons from merchants looking to ""share"" their special #HHM emojis, Aztec-themed vodka cocktails, and upscale tortilla presses and quesadilla makers.
Look for this silliness to eventually become extinct.
As immigration from Latin America slows and Hispanics continue to marry and reproduce with people from other ethnicities and races - and generally stop being made to feel as though their ancestry is their defining characteristic - the big to-do about Hispanic Heritage Month will go the way of German-American Heritage Month (also Sept. 15-Oct. 15), which I'd bet most people didn't know has been a thing since 1987.
Among Pew's 2012 findings about Hispanic/Latino labeling was that most Latinos (69 percent vs. 29 percent) said that the more than 50 million Latinos in the U.S. have many different cultures rather than a common culture.
This is not exactly a recipe for uniting around a particular ethnic label - and that is as it should be. The promise of the melting pot is that from many we become one. And what are we living through if not a moment in the nation's history when cross-category understanding and unity will be a key ingredient to successfully moving forward?"

An Arab-American on a street corner: Would you trust him?
By Olivia P. Tallet

""I trust you,"" Karim Sulayman declared on a poster he held during a social experiment a few weeks ago, in New York and Chicago. Since then, a video of him has gone viral.
The question, however, is if you would trust him, said Sulayman, an Arab-American opera singer who will sing with Houston Grand Opera next year, and may also perform his social experiment while in town. 
In the experiment, he stood blindfolded on a busy sidewalk, holding a handmade poster that declared that he is very scared, as are many people -- women, Latinx, black, GLBTQIA+, and so on. He asked that, to show support, people hug him or shake his hand.
Then, expecting any and all reactions, he waited.
In Houston in March, Sulayman will play an Algerian named Albert during the premiere of ""Some Light Emerges,"" with Houston Grand Opera.
The opera is composed by Laura Kaminsky and written by Mark Campbell and Kimberly Reed. According to the Grand Opera, ¨Some Light Emerges¨ celebrates the indelible impact of Houston?s Rothko Chapel, an ecumenical sanctuary and a symbol of human rights.
While here, Sulayman says, he may consider reenacting the street performance. 
The experiment, Sulayman says, has some points in common with the opera ¨Some Light Emerges.¨
Watch the video and see what happened. How would you react when he does the experiment in your city?"

After the Pulse massacre, I came out. I had to.
By Bianca Gomez

The headlines kept coming in, like wildfire. ""Deadly shooting at Orlando night club,"" ""49 killed and 53 injured.""
I woke up the morning after Pulse trying to make sense of what happened. I couldn't believe that this was the world we lived in.It was supposed to be a safe space and fun evening for black and brown queer people. What happened at Pulse would change everything I knew.
The worst U.S. mass shooting was, in fact, a hate crime, and I still can't wrap my mind around that a year later.
So what did I do?
I came out.
COMING OUT is supposed to be this rite of passage for LGBTQ+ people; sometimes it can turn out beautifully, and other times it can become a nightmare – the fear of that keeps people in the closet, unfortunately.
You could say my ""I'm not totally straight"" moment happened at Houston's Pride Parade in 2015, the year gay marriage was legalized nationwide.
That was the first Pride I attended, and the mood in the air was triumphant. The parade was held just days after the Supreme Court ruling, and being surrounded by so much love and support from complete strangers made me realize that I could be this loving, supportive, happy and empathetic person and still be out – who knew, right?
One night later that summer, my mom came to Houston for the weekend. We were both staying in the spare bedroom at my aunt's house. Earlier that day, I made plans with someone I met on Tinder, the dating app. I was excited about it; I couldn't stop thinking about what I would wear, what I wanted to talk about, how I wanted to do my makeup – and I wanted to share this with my mom.
But the daunting thought of her rejection kept circling my mind. My mom was having a conversation with me about her bus ride into Houston, but I was too busy thinking about whether I was prepared to pack my overnight bag.
So I casually mentioned I was going on a date that night with a girl. She shrugged and said, ""You've always been a weird child, anyway!""
Well, that could have gone way worse.
But even with the support of my immediate family and select friends, I still kept myself in the closet. I was at a point of finding myself while also feeling that I wasn't queer enough to come out to the world.
WHEN I marched in Pride 2016, days after the Pulse shooting, things changed. Looking at the crowd, watching those strangers out and proud even after this horrific event, made me realize that even the worst U.S. mass shooting in history couldn't stop these people from celebrating their unapologetic selves.
It was at that parade that I realized I needed to make my voice count. There are so many Latinx people who have no choice but staying in the closet for one reason or another.
And, while I'm aware I can't speak for an entire population, representation matters. So I came home that night, wrote one ""coming out"" Facebook post, and the rest is history.
But some of those Pulse victims were not given the same privilege to come out on their own terms. Some were forced out of the closet as a result of the shooting. In one instance, a father wouldn't claim his son's body because he found out he was gay – the sister did come forward and claim him, thankfully.
Stories like these are painful reminders that homophobia still runs deep in Latinx communities. They help us understand how that kind of hate can radicalize people like Omar Mateen. They're why we need to keep talking about this hate crime and stop using the blanket term ""act of terrorism.""
They remind us that to date in 2017, nine black trans women have been murdered.
And they tell us we still have a lot of work to do: Violence against queer and trans people of color did not end when gay marriage became legal.
I was lucky to be surrounded by so many loved ones at the anniversary of Pulse held last week at the Montrose Center. I ran into people I don't get to see often, and that told me how deeply this affected our community. An onlooker would have seen different walks of life in one place. But I saw a community that was glued together because of this event. Even almost 1,000 miles away, we were Orlando united.
During the vigil, the victims' names were called out one by one.
""Stanley Almodovar III, 23 years old.""
""Luis Daniel Conde, 39 years old.""
""Akyra Monet Murray, 18 years old.""
With each name came a bigger blow to my heart. I think about Pulse constantly, and it'll impact me the rest of my life.
But we can't show up once a year for change to happen. We need to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent another Pulse from happening: Stepping in when we see an injustice, becoming politically active, voting and normalizing our voices in spaces if we feel we can be out. We have to hold ourselves and each other accountable.
Before you go out to Pride tomorrow, don't forget it all started by trans women of color, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. Don't forget about Chay Reed, Alphonza Watson and the other black trans women who have been murdered this year. And don't forget about Amanda Alvear, Mercedez M. Flores, Christopher J. Sanfeliz and the other 46 victims who won't be able to celebrate with us."

With 'Coco,' 'we are no longer invisible'
By Monica Rhor

It is a box office blockbuster that pays homage to Mexican family and culture, features an almost entirely Latino cast and tramples on stereotypes. It has been cause for cheers – and copious tears – for Latino moviegoers, who are celebrating a rare moment of representation and weeping at a story that touches close to home.
""Coco,"" Disney Pixar's animated film about a young boy's adventures in the Land of the Dead, was number one with $108.7 million domestically and a total gross of $280 million worldwide. It's at the top of the box office in France, Spain and Germany and is breaking records in China and Mexico.
The success is all the more remarkable because of the current political climate, in which Latinos are often cast as undesirables. The president has called for a wall along the Mexican border. Stepped-up immigration enforcement has many living in fear.
""Coco"" also brings an often-absent big-screen presence for Latinos, who are 18 percent of the country's population but made up 23 percent of U.S. moviegoers in 2016, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. But only 5.8 percent of approximately 11,000 speaking characters in film and TV were Latino, a 2016 study by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found.
Despite an initial misstep when filmmakers tried to trademark the phrase ""Dia de los Muertos,"" or ""Day of The Dead,"" ""Coco"" is notable for its effort to create an authentic and accurate portrayal of Mexican culture.
I went to the movie theater prepared to cry. But I was not prepared for the force of the emotional wallop.
Maybe it was the shock of glimpsing my own Ecuadorean heritage in the story of a young Mexican boy and his boisterous, loving clan. I could recognize my mother, grandmother and aunts in the strong circle of women – mama, abuelas, tias – who shower the main character, Miguel, with equal parts adoration and discipline.
Though ""Coco"" is specific to Mexican culture and that country's celebration of ""Dia de los Muertos,"" Day of the Dead, so much of the movie evoked my own experience.
The town of Santa Cecilia, inspired by the Mexican town of Oaxaca, reminded me of the colonial architecture and ornate plazas of small pueblos in my homeland. The easy slide from English to español and back again felt as familiar as a dinnertime conversation from my childhood.
The snippets of movies patterned on the Golden Age of Mexican cinema sparked memories of my parents watching black-and-white classics starring Maria Felix and Cantinflas. The stirring ballads of singer Ernesto de La Cruz reminded me of the Ecuadorean boleros my father would play – at full volume – on weekend mornings.
I was stunned.
I saw myself, my family, my culture on a big screen.
I saw Latinos as fully-formed characters, not as the flat one-dimensional tropes – the fiery sexpots, heavily-accented maids and gangbangers – who usually populate movies and TV.
I saw the family ties that endure past generations and death, the deep roots of cultures that transcend distance, the sorrow of separation.
And I cried.
I cried for those we leave behind when we immigrate, for the borders and walls that keep us apart. I cried for my abuelos, my Papa Nino and Mama Luchi, who are buried in a town at the foothills of a volcano in Ecuador. I cried when Coco called for her father – and I heard the echo of my mother calling for hers: ""Papa.""
I cried because – finally – we are no longer invisible.
As moved as I was, I asked Latino readers, a fellow Houston Chronicle staff writer and cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz, who served as one of three cultural advisers for the film, for their reactions to ""Coco.""
Lalo Alcaraz, cartoonist and cultural adviser for ""Coco""
Could you tell me why you got involved as a consultant? I know you had been critical of Disney in the past.
I was asked by then-lone consultant Marcela Davison Aviles and Darla Anderson (the executive producer) to consider joining the team in order to help Pixar make the movie as authentic as possible. Granted, the Pixarians had already done lots of great work, including factual research in Oaxaca and other parts of Mexico, to get the holiday right and the look and feel of Mexico right and to be inspired. What our role would be was to catch those things that maybe only someone who grew up in the Mexican culture, and who would be experienced in writing, creating or working with that culture in mind, might be able to help the filmmakers convey.
Of course, it was a gamble for me, as I have been a critic of Disney, especially their effort to trademark Dia de Los Muertos for this very project. They withdrew that and obviously made up for it by producing an authentic movie showcasing Mexican culture without the usual negative Hollywood tropes about Mexico.
What did the involvement of Mexican-Americans/Latinos add to the movie? For example, were there touches or details that were changed to be more authentic?
So many, and really, involvement came from the Pixar artists and writers who were Mexican, Chicano and Latino, from the all Latino cast of actors who provided input, to our consulting team and the community members and leaders who we brought in and invited to give input, as well. It's a lot to cover. My push was encouraging the writer and director to keep as much Spanish in the film as possible and to not translate it for the audience in any way. And of course the abuelita's fearsome flying chancla was a thing our whole team encouraged the filmmakers to keep, even expand on.
Why do you think ""Coco"" has resonated so strongly with Mexican-American/Latino moviegoers? What kind of responses have you gotten from people?
Mexican-American moviegoers can't believe that Hollywood finally produced a movie featuring Mexican and Latino culture that doesn't seem whitewashed or watered down at all. I'm still amazed at how it came out, and I was there! Also, I did not foresee the emotional response from families with elderly relatives or dearly departed or how it brought so many people out to the movies together on family outings. It's truly a watershed film, a movie moment!
Does the movie resonate with you on a personal level? Are there scenes that were especially emotional for you?
My mother just passed away 3 years ago, and she suffered from dementia for years. It is painful to see Mama Coco suffering from these symptoms. I get emotional up every time I see her on screen, but I literally choke up when she smiles from recognition at the end of the film. She lights up the screen!
What do you hope the movie will accomplish? Do you think this will lead to greater Latino representation in films/TV?
I feel like this is a circle that has been completed for me. This film was everything that I was missing when I was a child. Brown people were and largely continue to be invisible on TV and film. ""Coco"" shows that our stories, even our faces, are just as necessary and as interesting as anyone else's. I do believe this will lead to more representation in films and TV, and it will inspire young children to create their own art. I can't even imagine what will come of this down the road, and that's beautiful. Representation matters!
Lupe Mendez, Houston-based poet, activist and educator
Keeping my composure during this film was difficult. It pulled at heartstrings multiple times. The combination of the visuals, the bilingual, realistic conversations between individuals and the focus on both feminine role models and cultura made this more than a film, it was an experience.
I honestly will have to go back to see it again. There was so much packed into the movie: the visual representations of iconic figures Frida Kahlo, Pedro Infante, El Santo, Jorge Negrete and Cantinflas; the images surrounding indigenous Aztec beliefs; the barrio and the urban sprawl of the land of the dead and the commentary on immigration and classism that still haunt the living world today. There was just so much that my brain couldn't process all at once.
The story was perfect. The use of music was spot-on. The use of even the alebrijes was a nice touch. Though I would have liked for the film to have spoken a bit for the Afro-Mexican connections – I thought it was moving.
The most breathtaking moment, where I got a knot in my throat, was the moment Miguel sets his eyes after entering the land of the dead – the bridges of marigolds, the intricacies of a city were beyond my wildest dreams. Sadly, I have never had a moment to dream of what the land of the dead would look like.
I did not grow up seeing images of anything remotely positive that were also Mexican or Latinx. I grew up with Speedy Gonzalez, the Taco Bell dog and Julio from Sanford and Son. I grew up with novelas, Tejano 106.5 (KQQK) and La Tremenda 1010 AM. What I wouldn't give to have seen this when I was 8 or 10. Perhaps I wouldn't have questioned, ""Do I really belong here?"" – no, I would have known I did.
I hope this film fills Latinx youth with a sense of belonging and wonder. We are not exotic, we are here, we are real.
Juan Alanis, Houston blogger and Director of Public Relations at Big Oak Tree Media
At the end of the movie, everyone in the theater applauded, and that was actually kind of exciting. It's not every day you get to watch a movie that celebrates so much of the things we have in common in such an honest way.
I really did identify with the characters and the story of ""Coco,"" especially on a cultural level. The grandmother could have easily been my grandmother, because of the way she was portrayed. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. To me, that means the movie did a really good job of relating to so many of us in such a personal level.
My wife lost her grandmother earlier this year. I lost my father. We both came away from the movie thinking about them and really appreciating the message of the movie to honor and celebrate our loved ones, even after they are no longer with us. And we both shed more than a few tears remembering them.
That's not something you just forget about when you leave the theater.
Clarissa L. Valdez, Pearland mother
We went to see Coco together as a family. We'd read all the reviews. We'd prepared the kids for the ""Frozen"" trailer. We were ready. But would it meet and exceed expectations?
Would it be disappointing? Vanity Fair called Coco a ""love letter to México,"" where I know no one except very distance acquaintances from my childhood. Would it be relevant to our American lives? Then it started – and it was familiar.
The papel picado cutouts my dad hangs in the yard. The ofrenda room so like my mom's altar room. The entire family practically living and working on top of each other, great-grandmothers and grandparents and parents and kids fussing and fighting but not wanting to be apart.
When Coco appeared, I cried. I knew that face, the face of my great-grandmother Mama Tea. A quiet woman who lived to be 103. We would visit her once a year in her west Texas adobe home accessible only by dirt roads.
She would sit on the couch in her living room filled with retablos and photos and Catholic iconography, holding our hands and touching our faces. She only spoke Spanish, and we only spoke English, but she'd sit and stare, taking us all in before we had to leave for another year. She would pat my hand and chuckle through her toothless grin. When Coco appeared in a lucha libre mask, I remembered my grandmother, Mama Lucy, Mama Tea's daughter, making blanket forts for me in her TV room.
With Miguel telling Coco everything, flashes of the patience my grandmother displayed multiple times a day when I called her just to chat and make her guess what noises I was making. Pepita pouncing was the perfect spirit animal for any Mexican matriarch, but mostly my mother and my grandmothers – the mama grizzly bear inside every Mexican mother, even me. Most of all, ""Coco"" felt like you were being seen and acknowledged in a way you didn't know you needed when you first sat down.
And that being Mexican was just fine.
Jose Luis Jimenez, insurance agent
If you haven't seen ""Coco,"" I highly recommend it. If you know Spanish, go see it in Spanish.
This movie took me through every emotion and memory of my life. It took me to my childhood visits to my Bisabuelita Luz and Bisabuelito Ramon and the moments we spent together. Watching my bisabuelita from the floor of her home listening to the radio and singing in her kitchen while I acted like I was still asleep. I loved listening to her sing.
It took me to my Grandma Esperanza's home and all the special moments I experienced with her, watching her love all of us with no limits.
It took me to the special moments and conversations I had with my Abuelito Luis. It took me to my Tia Lencha's home and all the special moments at her home, too. It took me to mi abuelita Juanita's home and seeing her in her chair and mi abuelito Valentin and his sombrero.
Thank you, Disney and Pixar, for capturing moments of my life in this movie.
Ileana Najarro, Houston Chronicle business writer
I grew up on the platitudes of Disney and Pixar films. How it's important to be true to yourself, whether you're a diamond in the rough or a rat with a dream. How love is a powerful force, whether you're royalty or robots. How family ties, across all species, are worth cherishing.
This last lesson, about family and its importance in one's life, is at the core of ""Coco."" But this time it felt so much more personal.
Though Disney in particular hasn't shied away from addressing how departed relatives carry on with us in spirit (looking at you, Mufasa), ""Coco"" focuses on this message, expanding upon it to include the importance of knowing one's family history, warts and all.
The kicker? The lesson is imparted through characters who look and sound like me and my family.
So when the protagonist interacts with his grandmother who dresses almost exactly the way my own grandmother likes to dress, the characters resonate with me at a much deeper, art-imitates-life level.
I got to engage with the story's universal message of enduring familial love with an added personal connection to the characters and setting that can only someone with a Latinx heritage can really understand.
In fact, visually and linguistically there are several details throughout the film that only Latinx audiences and others with significant exposure to Latinx culture would really get. The chancla, ""no manches,"" how big a deal Pedro Infante really was and how excellently the film parodies him and his body of work.
These nods and winks made my movie-going experience feel so much more special. By the time the credits rolled I found myself crying both sad and happy tears.
While my heart broke remembering my own lost loved ones, it came together in joy knowing that ""Coco"" exists and that the next generation of young Latinx cinephiles will get to see a film that uniquely speaks to them culturalmente."

¿No habla español? You can still be Latino [Opinion]
By Esther J. Cepeda

Way to guilt-trip me about my parenting choices, Pew Research Center!
According to their newest report on language acquisition, 85 percent of Latino parents say they speak Spanish to their children, but only 71 percent of U.S.-born Latino parents with at least one immigrant parent of their own do so.
It’s small comfort to know that I’m not alone in dropping the ball by not ensuring that my children learned to speak my native language. And it gets worse: The likelihood of my grandchildren speaking Spanish is bleak.
I’m not merely pessimistic. The share of Latinos speaking to their children in Spanish falls to just 49 percent among third- or higher-generation Latino parents (those born in the U.S. to U.S.-born parents).
My situation, however, fell into this category: Just 55 percent of Latino parents with a non-Latino partner say they speak Spanish to their children.
I bet most of those families, like us, swore they’d raise their kids bilingually.
But let’s face it: The normal stresses of infancy, toddlerhood and the early elementary school years are tough enough without layering on the immensely difficult task of having one parent speak in a language that the other parent maybe doesn’t even understand.
On this, I can’t speak from experience. My husband, a non-Spanish-speaker, and I never got that far.
I nearly died giving birth to an underweight, premature son who had severe developmental delays. As time passed and he wasn’t speaking, the doctors and speech pathologists posited that perhaps our 19-month-old was tongue-tied and needed a frenulectomy.
Yes, American medical professionals suggested surgery to cut the tissue that connected my baby’s tongue to the floor of his mouth.
Incidentally, this was not completely unheard of. My husband and I had read about it in “The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts,” by the Chinese-American author Maxine Hong Kingston.
“[M]y mother cut my tongue. She pushed my tongue up and sliced the frenum. Or maybe she snipped it with a pair of nail scissors. I don’t remember her doing it, only her telling me about it,” Hong Kingston wrote. She explained that her mom, “’cut it so that you would not be tongue-tied. Your tongue would be able to move in any language.’”
We certainly wanted the same for our son, but took a hard pass on cutting his frenulum.
Instead, his first language was American Sign Language, which my husband and I happily learned so we could speak and sign simple words like “girl,” “boy,” “thank you,” “more,” “shoes,” and the super-fun pulling motion of “milk.”
The experts told us not to throw a third language into the mix, and, thankfully, our kid eventually spoke as naturally and fluently as any other.
By the time his brother came along, the good intentions had gone out the window and our whole household, including grandparents, spoke only English. Eventually, the enthusiastic but failed attempts to grind some Spanish into the kids fell by the wayside in the din of busy family life.
Sigh.
It still makes me sad not to have passed on the Spanish language. Sometimes it feels like, aside from my hair and eye color, my boys have nothing of me; not my surname, not my language.
But that’s how the melting pot works — and I can always hope they marry a passionate Spanish speaker who inspires them to learn Spanish for their kids.
In the meantime, take it from me: My children are no less a part of the United States’ cultural heritage of Latin American immigrants just because they don’t speak Spanish.
So if you meet someone who identifies as Hispanic — or Latino, Latinx, Mexican-American or whatever — but they admit they don’t speak Spanish, don’t give them a hard time about it.
Look, German is the eighth-most popular language other than English spoken at home in the United States (933,000 people speak it, and about 85 percent of them are bilingual, according to the Migration Policy Institute). But you wouldn’t go around looking down on every Bohm, Schneider and Franke for not speaking German, would you?
If you are Hispanic and grew up getting razzed about not speaking Spanish, ignore the haters — you’re no less Hispanic for it, and you can always learn the language.
But if you really think you can’t learn it or don’t want to — don’t sweat it, we’ll love you anyway."

Houston teen, accepted to 20 colleges, makes his choice
By William Axford

A Houston teen who made national news for getting accepted to 20 different universities has decided which school he's going to attend.
Michael Brown tweeted ""#stanford2022"" on Thursday. The 17-year-old Lamar High senior is from Houston's Third Ward. Brown was offered a full ride to each school he applied to, which mounted to more than $260,000 in scholarships.
Other than Stanford, Brown was considering Northwestern, Georgetown, Princeton, Yale, the University on Pennsylvania and Harvard.
Brown's other full-ride schools included Amherst, Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Texas at Austin.
Brown made national headlines a second time after two news hosts on Fox 5 DC called him  ""obnoxious"" for being accepted to 20 different colleges.
""It's a little ridiculous that this kid applied to 20 (colleges), taking away a spot and basically wait-listing another kid,"" said contributor Sarah Fraser in early April.
""It's a little obnoxious because you can only go to one. You can only take one full ride, and you are taking a spot from someone who worked really hard,"" said anchor Holly Morris.
Fraser eventually apologized to Brown. Morris did not apologize for her comments.
These local Fox anchors criticized a Black student who received a full ride to 20 colleges. One of the anchors Fox 5 Morning News DC stated, “It’s a little ridiculous that this kid applied to 20 taking away a spot and basically waitlisting another kid.” Another stated, “I mean, if he could have applied to five, he would have gotten into all five. It would have been equally as impressive. You can Google as many articles as you want, admissions officers will say on average you should apply to four to eight schools…” The argument is often used against students or color, that they are taking away spots from other students. But Black and Latinx students are more underrepresented at top colleges today than they were 35 years ago, according to a 2017 NY Times analysis. The student, Michael Brown, earned a 4.68 GPA, a 1540 SAT score, and a 34 ACT score, so the argument that he didn’t work just as hard to earn those acceptances as other kids doesn’t hold weight at all. Now, he gets to decide which of the 20 colleges he would like to attend and at start his future at, including Harvard, Yale, Georgetown and Vanderbuilt. "

Cedric the Entertainer’s ‘The Neighborhood’ joins a wave of TV shows about gentrification
By Jane Borden

Within the first 30 seconds of CBS’ new sitcom “The Neighborhood,” the tweenage boy of a white family relocating to LA from the Midwest tells his parents matter of factly that Granny “wishes we weren’t moving to a black neighborhood.”
His father, Dave Johnson, played by Max Greenfield, scrambles to manage the taboo, saying, “Buddy, I wouldn’t call it a black neighborhood.” His son innocently asks, “Really?” and then points out of the window of the car, announcing, “He’s black. He’s black. She’s black.”
As gentrification reshapes urban areas across America in increasingly complex ways, co-executive producers Jim Reynolds and Cedric the Entertainer wanted to address the topic — but didn’t want to pull punches. “My goal from the beginning has been: Let’s be honest,” Reynolds says.
“The Neighborhood” is based on Reynolds’ own experience of moving with his family, about five years ago, into a historically African-American area of Pasadena, Calif. Then Cedric joined the project and fleshed out the experience of the Butlers — he plays the father — who have lived in the neighborhood for generations and whose hospitality toward the Johnsons is coupled with skepticism.
The show joins a swell of others tackling the topic on television. In TBS’ “The Last O.G.,” ex-convict Tray (Tracy Morgan) leaves prison to find the Brooklyn neighborhood where he used to sell crack now populated by coffee shops, strollers and selfie-taking millennials. In Season 5 of Showtime’s “Shameless,” hipsters move into the Gallaghers’ poverty-stricken Chicago neighborhood. And NBC’s “The Carmichael Show,” set in Charlotte, did an episode about gentrification in 2016.
Los Angeles is a frequent backdrop for gentrification stories. “Vida,” a Starz drama, is set in Boyle Heights, on the Latino-dominated eastside, where gentrification is rampant. Also set there is the short-form show “Gente-fied,” which premiered at Sundance last year and is currently in full-series development with Netflix. And the changes happening in the Baldwin Park and Inglewood neighborhoods have been a recurring subject on HBO’s “Insecure.”
“The Neighborhood” is inspired by an LA where the black population’s proportion is decreasing (from 13 percent of Los Angeles County in 1980 to 9 percent in 2010). Many historically black LA neighborhoods are majority Latino now (70 percent of Watts in 2015, for example). Only a handful of neighborhoods in LA remain black majority, such as Inglewood, Windsor Park and parts of Pasadena. And gentrification is coming. The Los Angeles Times reported that average rents rose from $124 per square foot in Inglewood in 2012 to $217 per square foot in 2017.
“These are the last black neighborhoods in greater LA. It’s really unsettling,” says journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan, who lives in Inglewood and frequently writes about African-American issues.
All of this informs Cedric the Entertainer’s character, Calvin Butler, whom Reynolds describes as reeling from “what he feels to be the erosion of his community.” In the pilot, Calvin explains to his son, “Our family has been in this neighborhood for generations, and the culture that we’ve worked to create is worthy of respect.”
“We want to make people aware that where people grow up and where they live, and how they identify themselves is important,” Cedric says. “The idea that because somebody comes in, you no longer belong, has to come into the conversation.”
In the show, the families are candid with one another. Calvin’s son Marty pops by the Johnsons to meet them, saying, “I had to come and see for myself.” When Dave expresses reluctance to attend the Butlers’ barbecue because he doesn’t want to put off Calvin, Marty explains, “You’ve got to come or you’ll seem racist.”
Do neighbors in Kaplan’s neighborhood speak that candidly with one another? “Uh, no,” she says with a laugh. With some exceptions, she laments, “I’m aware of these white people not communicating with any of us. I feel this terrible loss of control in my own neighborhood. A friend of mine put it this way: They are just waiting until the cavalry arrives. ‘You will be gone soon enough, I don’t need to know you.’”
It’s no accident that the Johnsons are transplants from the Midwest instead of another LA neighborhood. Reynolds wanted them to be, he says, “as socially isolated as possible, which would force them to make friends and reach out to their neighbors.” He also wanted the outsider family to embody the traditional Midwestern values of being friendly and neighborly.
“Vida” depicts a very different dynamic. It’s set in a historically immigrant neighborhood southeast of downtown LA, where a radical anti-gentrification movement has led a handful of recently opened galleries and at least one coffee shop to close and leave.
Many of “Vida’s” scenes are ripped from the headlines, including when the character Mari spray-paints “white art” (along with an expletive) on a gallery window, an actual oft-cited act of Boyle Heights activist vandalism. The show tells the story of two sisters who grew up in the neighborhood but left for Chicago and San Francisco. Show creator Tanya Saracho says “Vida” is about gente-fication, “gentrification of a Latinx space by other, usually upwardly mobile, Latinxs,” she says. “By definition, the sisters coming back and taking over their dead mother’s bar, with plans for improvement, makes them gente-fiers.”
Now Saracho has herself been accused of gente-fication. Activists argue that she and Starz are profiting off the neighborhood by telling a story about it, and have issued calls to protest on location during production for Season 2. Saracho declined to comment on the topic, preferring to discuss her aims for the series. “I seek to humanize us,” says the showrunner, who was born in Mexico. “We have gotten so very few chances to tell our stories that we are thirsty for any attempt at representation.”
Reynolds and Cedric also have lofty goals. Calvin and Dave will become friends, allowing more of their cultural differences to bump up against one another. Cedric describes it as a “family comedy with some degree of the old Norman Lear energy.” He adds, “We wanted to show how we have to learn to grow, accept, let go of ideas, and allow us to be better people.”
At the end of the pilot, Dave earnestly expresses to Malcolm Butler, Calvin’s second son, in a quiet moment, “I really think that if we could focus on what we have in common rather than what makes us different, then we could solve a lot of our problems.”
Malcolm replies, “That may be true. But I also think it’s a lot easier for someone like you to believe that than it is for someone like me.”
Dave responds simply, “OK.”
Kaplan isn’t sure whites and blacks can ever truly be neighbors. “Gentrification is a euphemism for nonintegration. Whites come in and when they occupy space, it has to be white.” She describes an advertisement she saw on the website for an apartment complex on Crenshaw. “I was very startled to find the site has all white people in the pictures and ads. It was chilling.”
Kaplan describes neighborhood diversity — of race or class — as typically temporary, only existing during gentrification, which is a small window. These television shows depict that window. “The Neighborhood” argues that we can learn to get along if we become neighbors. But once the forces of gentrification are in motion, we might not be neighbors for long.
It’s already happening to Reynolds’ Pasadena neighborhood. “When my family moved in, it was with zero intention of being gentrifiers, but I have come to realize that, despite that intention, we are contributing to that development,” he says. “People I have come to appreciate and befriend are moving away. To see my community replaced with something more homogenous is the opposite of what I wanted. And yet there is a sense of inevitability. It’s a system. It’s driven by money. And it is much larger than the individuals themselves.”"

Transgender people are being threatened. They need allies. [Opinion]
By Julien Gomez

As a nonbinary Latinx person, a little thing such as getting the gender marker ""X"" on my Texas driver's license looked like a possibility, as it seemed as though the U.S. were headed toward progress.
As I look at my license now, though, the ""F"" gender marker continues to become more foreign to me. Throughout my life, I've always felt that something was different about me, whether it was my sexuality or my gender identity — and, as it turns out, I was right about both. My gender identity is something I have to work with every day – in fact, my therapist told me recently that I have to learn to be OK with the fact that I might never figure out whether I'm a ""boy"" or a ""girl.""
Part of learning to be OK with that was the possibility of ""X"" as my gender marker on my license, but this fall things began to look dimmer. As I read the news one Sunday, I thought to myself, Here is a memo that would nullify you and so many other people.
On Sunday, October 21, the New York Times reported that the Department of Health and Human Services was preparing to redefine the term ""sex"" under Title IX for the purposes of several key government agencies, allegedly writing in an internal memo the Times obtained that these agencies ""needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender"" that ""would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable and determined by the genitals that a person is born with."" But such a redefinition flies in the face of science, medicine and the law. It seems an attempt not just to eliminate protections for transgender individuals, but to stop recognizing them altogether.
Reducing someone's gender identity to their genitals is violence. It tells me and my community that my existence doesn't matter because I don't identify with my sex assigned at birth — it's why to date this year, at least 22 transgender individuals have been killed, a majority of them trans women of color.
This administration has repeatedly attempted to erase transgender people and deny them protections, and their messages that target the transgender community have only fueled similar legislation at the state levels. This year, according to the National Center for Trans Equality, there have been 21 anti-trans bills introduced in 10 states, and anti-trans ballot initiatives could show up in two other states.
I saw it happen in my own city when the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) did not pass, a devastating blow to Houston and its LGBTQ+ community. Despite clear messages from the mainstream medical, psychological and scientific communities, this administration continues to try to effectively erase protections for transgender individuals — protections such as access to health care, housing and employment.
Though the rhetoric and violence continues to put our lives at risk, I know it's not over. This memo serves as a reminder that the fight for equality is at the beginning, not the end — our fight for equal rights did not end with marriage equality. This proposed plan to redefine ""sex"" does not take away the fact that my community and I have worked to ensure that our voices are heard and present.
But we can't continue to do the work alone.
If you identify as an ally to the trans and nonbinary community at any capacity, now is the time to speak up and do the work to help us. Just in 2017, there was nearly one homicide a week of an LGBTQ person in the U.S.
Though the memo can't hide our existence and the precedents set by dozens of federal court decisions in the past two decades affirming the trans community, our safety might be compromised. This means that your contributions to the trans community can't stop at the voting booth or hashtagging #WontBeErased on your posts.
It means things such as volunteering your time to a transgender-supporting organization, starting transgender support groups in your neighborhood or school, donating to organizations that support trans women of color or undocumented communities, confronting hate speak and implicit bias or even sharing the messaging of other trans activists in your community.
But, most importantly, it means never stopping asking how you can best support this community in this volatile climate — let ""ally"" become a verb for you."

To save Houston’s schools, fight the TEA [Opinion]
By Kandice Webber

Last month, the Houston Independent School District trustees voted to reject any partnerships with outside organizations to take over its schools. In doing so, they declared that separate is never equal and that all HISD kids deserve the opportunity to succeed.
We must now take the next step and fight the Texas Education Agency by first demanding that the Texas Legislature repeal the law that allows the state to replace a democratically elected board. If the law isn’t changed, we must sue the TEA to prevent a takeover.
State laws allow the TEA to take over an entire school district on the basis of a single campus being deemed “improvement required” for five or more years unless that school shuts down or permits a takeover by an outside group. That improvement-required status is based largely on the standardized STAAR test.
This policy perpetuates a broken approach to education that has been going on for years: Test kids to death with inherently flawed exams. Punish them, their teachers and their communities if they fail by a methodology that doesn’t apply. Ignore poverty and other systemic factors.
In the end, the TEA treats schools like a business, with data sheets that transform kids into bottom lines instead of beautiful, worthwhile, unique cases with their own personal challenges as they grow into adults.
This isn’t what anyone should want for our students.
That’s not to say HISD schools have always served kids well. Individual campuses have their own unique problems. However, the root of education issues is almost always poverty — and tests won’t fix that. Unfortunately, our school system is now entirely based on passing the test. This methodology has placed a stranglehold on our classrooms that prevents teachers from meeting the needs of their students and keeps kids from learning.
That’s why the prospect of a TEA takeover is so worrisome. The agency perpetuates a narrative of failing schools based on testing, and then promotes privatization policies as the solution. The threat is clear: Accept a charter or risk hostile strong-arming by bureaucrats. State government is holding a gun to the head of the public and demanding we surrender our students.
So it is understandable that TEA’s takeover threats have frightened many of the traditional defenders of public education.
Just look at the plan proposed by the mayor’s education director Juliet Stipeche. With little — if any — input from parents, teachers or students, she created a nonprofit designed for an HISD partnership called the “Coalition for Excellence and Equity in Education.” Its board was originally comprised of three non-educators.
What gave the push for the partnership its power was fear of a state takeover. If the Legislature won’t change the law, we must take TEA to court to remove its power to make such threats.
We believe that a lawsuit can succeed on several grounds. First, TEA memos have demonstrated that the agency failed to meet age-appropriate time requirements in 2016. There is already a case before a Texas court on these grounds that judges have affirmed is worth hearing.
Second, an older version STAAR was found by a University of Texas professor, Walter Stroup, to be invalid at measuring learning and 50 percent insensitive to instruction. Can we trust the current version is much better? We may be relying on a deeply flawed test to guide make-or-break decisions about entire school districts.
Third, relying on the test violates equal protection under the law. The more black or the more Latinx a school is, and the poorer it is, the more likely it is to be threatened by the state with closures or removal of its democratically-elected school board.
In the meantime, the Legislature must repeal the law that would wipe out our democratically elected school board on the basis of test scores. State Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, has said he will file this bill. The Legislature should pass it.
It’s time to return power to the students, parents and teachers. Urge HISD, the biggest school district in Texas, to sue, and for your state reps and senators to repeal. Tell them to do it for the good of our kids."

Online directory of Latinx Houston artists goes live
By Ileana Najarro

MantecaHTX, a new online directory of Houston's Latinx artists, launched on Thursday as part of the nonprofit, Nuestra Palabra's, Cultural Acceleration Program.
Latinx artists from various disciplines can create profiles on the site to better promote their work and get advanced notice of upcoming arts events and opportunities, according to a statement from the project's leading team.
""My vision is to survey and showcase a concise selection of artworks from emerging Latinx artists in order to demonstrate the diversity of heritage and cultural influence inherent in the thriving creative community active in Houston,"" said Theresa Escobedo, co-founder of MantecaHTX and curator of the Union and Main Street Projects in the city.
The site, funded in part by the Houston Arts Alliance, currently features 11 literary artists, seven performing artists and 63 visual arts from across the city.
Directory leaders plan to expand the project's reach by partnering with other cities down the line.
""This is what we have always been about,"" said Tony Diaz, Nuestra Palabra founder.""The entire nation will soon think of Houston as the leader in delivering and supporting our community's art."""

Latino Art Now! shines light on a sprawling talent pool
By Molly Glentzer

Houston’s population is nearly 45 percent Latino. So where is the Latino art scene?
Well, everywhere, actually — tangled into every corner of the urban fabric, yet no easier to define than the character of the sprawling, mega-diverse city itself.
Latino Art Now! Houston, an area-wide celebration that runs through May, will bring more awareness to a local talent force that spans the spectrum from highly trained conceptual artists to self-taught muralists. More than 70 local cultural organizations are participating. The catalyst is a biennial, national conference of visual-art scholars — Latino Arts Now! — that the University of Houston hosts for the first time April 4-6.
Organized by the Inter-University Program for Latino Research, a consortium that partners with the Smithsonian Latino Center, the conference involves three solid days of concurrent talks on topics as varied as “Migrant Struggles Against Gentrification,” “New Digital Platforms” and “Bodies, Genders, Sexualities.”
LAN! aims to spark conversations about the creation and dissemination of Latino art that are “particularly important to global cities like Houston, where U.S. Latinos have played prominent roles in shaping artistic culture,” said Pamela Quiroz, the director of UH’s Center for Mexican American Studies and executive director of the consortium. “We’re going to celebrate both national and local Latino artists.”
More than a dozen Houston-based scholars and artists are among the 135 or so conference panelists. As part of its pre-conference field work, the consortium identified more than 250 Houston-area Latino visual artists and added them to a national registry. “We are researchers. We love data,” said art historian Olga Herrera, who was involved in that project.
Houston’s population of Latino artists looks similar to that of other major U.S. cities in one respect, Herrera said: The majority are not native to the city but have migrated from other U.S. cities or other countries, “just going where the jobs are.”
That doesn’t mean fewer natives aspire to become artists, but it might suggest they don’t see equal opportunities or aren’t encouraged to pursue fine art.
The work of about 50 local artists will appear on billboards across the city that were funded by UH and Clear Channel. Though that outreach was deliberately democratic, curated shows at area galleries and museums offer a deeper dive.
University of Houston-Downtown’s O’Kane Gallery has hung “Close to Home: Latinx Art and Identity,” a marvelous show of prints and paintings by several generations of U.S. Latinos that combines iconic images and up-to-the-minute works by important newcomers.
The show’s 56 works are from a group of 100 given to UH-Downtown by San Antonio’s Harriett and Ricardo Romo, major collectors who have focused on Latino art — especially works on paper — since the 1970s. O’Kane director, Mark Cervenka, who curated the show, plans to hang the prints across the UH-Downtown campus after the exhibition closes.
Awash in bold color and graphics, the works convey themes of empowerment, rendered in diverse styles that express Latinx identity as specific, powerful and ancient. Giants such as Frank Romero, Carlos Alvarez, Patssi Valdez and Luis Jimenez are in the mix along with younger powerhouses Michael Menchaca (known for his animated videos based on ancient codex imagery) and Vincent Valdez, a master draftsman.
Cervenka has grouped a number of prints from legendary workshops such as Los Angeles’ Self Help Graphics and Modern Multiples and Austin’s Coronado Studios. Prints have been integral to the evolution of Latino and Chicano art because they’re often produced at community-minded ateliers who offer artists an inexpensive outlet, Cervenka said. “It’s about making work that’s honest and sincere in terms of their own vision.”
At Rudolph Blume Fine Art/Artscan Gallery in Montrose, the show “Artimañas /Revealed” features politically and socially minded contemporary art in a mix of mediums by Texas artists Celia Alvarez Muñoz, Casey Arguelles Gregory, Rabéa Ballin, Jesus Gonzalez, Cristy Jadick and Gabriel Martinez. (Artimañas translates as “tricks of the hand.”)
Jadick fills most of a room with the installation “Wall.” Its cinderblock centerpiece is surrounded with a micro-desert and stenciled with text borrowed from the Statue of Liberty’s famous inscription, “Bring me your tired, your poor …”
In his evocative video “Ramas de mezclilla (denim branches),” Gonzalez walks toward the Texas-Mexico border carrying a huge, yellow sail, amid backpack sculptures made of denim, as a narrator reads Mexican poet Alberto Blanco’s verse, “My Tribe.”
Muñoz’s Las Mordidas: El Poder del Privilegio (The Bribes: The Power of Privilege)” — a 15-by-15-foot print on vinyl mesh — is too large to unfurl completely in the space, but viewers quickly get the gist: It layers dense text about the unsolved murders of women in Juarez, Mexico, over imagery from the Mexican flag.
Ballin has placed pillow-shaped soft sculptures printed with text (six chapters of her “#sixwordstories” project) under a series of digital works on metal that depict the same image, increasingly lightened. Martinez, who utilizes found objects to construct objects that “map” neighborhoods, has contributed an all-black, fabric quilt-painting. He will lead an “Art and Politics” panel during the conference that includes Ballin and three other artists.
Photography by Houstonian Francis Almendárez, another of the “Art and Politics” panelists, will be up soon in “Nuestro Hogar,” a two-person show at Jonathan Hopson Gallery that tackles identity questions from a more intimate, domestic perspective. Curator Debra Barrera, who also is a well-respected Latina artist, co-owns Hopson with her husband. The gallery operates from the front rooms of their Montrose residence.
Barrera said she would have done “Nuestro Hogar” regardless of the LAN! hooplah. “I think a lot about home space. It’s the first curatorial space we encounter, the first aesthetic we see,” she said.
Her own work often riffs on the experience of growing up in a modest home in Corpus Christi as the daughter of Mexican-Americans. Almendárez and the show’s other artist, Ana Fernandez, explore similar themes from different directions, as gay individuals.
Though the LAN! conference is devoted to visual art, the citywide celebrations are all-inclusive.
Mitchell Center for the Arts’ 2019 CounterCurrent Festival in early April will present two of its many performances under the LAN! Houston banner at MATCH’s small blackbox space. Both feature nationally known talents who explore gender identity: Jenif(f)er Tamayo’s “La Queeradora” riffs on the kids’ TV series “Dora the Explorer.” Awilda Rodríguez Lora’s “Susteno: From La Performera to La Mujer Maravilla,” co-presented with DiverseWorks, is a lecture performance.
Tony Diaz is using the occasion to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the literary organization he founded, Nuestra Palabra. His literary showcase April 3 at the MFAH features the godfather of Chicano literature, Dagoberto Gilb, and a number of other voices. Nuestra Palabra’s lineup features MFAH curator Mari Carmen Ramírez, the founder of the museum’s International Center for the Arts of the Americas — who also is the conference’s keynote speaker.
Ramírez has introduced galaxies of Latin American artists to a global audience, but local Latinos have never been her focus, frustrating many in Houston’s community.
“If I were working in any other place, they might look at me,” said painter Geraldina Interiano Wise, a native of El_Salvador who performs with her brushes and canvas during live, collaborative concerts with area musicians.
Wise is among a number of Houstonians asking what a better infrastructure for Latino art could look like in Houston. A major cultural center or museum devoted to Latino art would be a start. “But how do we coalesce?” Wise said. “And if we did, where would the money come from?”
A few legacy organizations have been around for years, “but the city has left them behind,” she added. “There’s only so much Ballet Folklorico you can bring.”
Groups must organize to be heard, Wise said. She has put herself out there through LatinAmerican Women Artists, Houston, a group recently established by Glassell School instructor Arielle Masson for her students. They are presenting LAN! Houston events at the George Memorial Library in Sugar Land and the Glade Arts Foundation in The Woodlands. “There’s Latino communities everywhere, and they’re starved for culture,” Wise said, “so doors are opening.”
Barrera appreciates the LAN! efforts. Special events and festivals help bring conversations forward, but they come and go, she said. “I hope it goes beyond.”
Wise agrees. Spring’s showcases are “an incredible boon for the city to know itself a little better,” she said."

Alley Theatre showcases new directions in 2019-2020 season announcement
By Wei-Huan Chen

The Alley Theatre’s 774-seat mainstage will soon feature a Latino-penned play with an all-Latino cast — a decision newly-appointed artistic director Rob Melrose says symbolizes the company’s newfound dedication to reflecting Houston’s diversity.
“We’ve been having meetings with the Latinx community on how the Alley can be better neighbors to our Latinx organizations,” he said. “One thing we heard back was having a prominent Latinx play on the mainstage would send a good signal. That was something everyone said.”
The play, “Quixote Nuevo,” is a modern look at the canonical character of Don Quixote. It’s written by Octavio Solis, a prominent Latino-American playwright, a Texas native and a friend of Melrose’s.
It was announced as part of Friday’s unveiling of The Alley Theatre’s 2019-20 season that also features the breakout 2016 play “Vietgone,” a musical dramedy by Qui Nguyen about Vietnamese refugees in America that features an entirely Asian-American cast.
Melrose says the season was programmed with three main points in mind: preserving Alley Theatre tradition (“A Christmas Carol,” Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express”), better reflecting Houston and utilizing the theater’s company of actors (“The Winter’s Tale”).
Rob Melrose says his first season of plays as artistic director of the Alley Theatre will also tackle pressing social issues. “Amerikin” by Chisa Hutchinson is about a white supremacist who finds out through a DNA test that he is of African-American descent. “1984,” adapted from George Orwell’s novel by Michael Gene Sullivan, wrestles with surveillance, fake news and government control.
And “Camp David,” by Texas journalist and playwright Lawrence Wright, delves into a historical event — an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1978 — that has startling relevance to modern day current events.
“Camp David” will be directed by famed theater director Oskar Eustis who directed the original production of “Angels in America,” and, as artistic director of New York’s Public Theater, oversaw development of “Hamilton.”"

New Latino culture speaker series kicks off
By Ileana Najarro

Local writer, educator and activist Tony Diaz will kick off a new speaker series called “Community Cultural Capital,” focusing on diverse Latino experiences in Houston.
The series, funded in part by the Houston Arts Alliance, begins at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at Yes Prep Gulfton with guest speaker Maria Duran, founder of the multicutural marketing company Duran Concepts LLC. The talk will focus on Central American perspectives on Latino culture, particularly in Houston.
“Houston is going through a cultural renaissance propelled by the diversity of the city, so it’s important for Central Americans to be a part of it,” Duran said in a written statement. “We represent the second largest segment of the Latinx community, and this is a great way to connect, support and recognize the contributions made by our artisans, musicians, chefs, craftspeople and creatives across the creative art disciplines.”
The series will continue with three other events this month.
“At the most basic level, this is a profound examination of the diversity of diversity,” Diaz said in a statement. “We as Chicanos and Tejanos need to support the other branches of the Latino family tree.”"

Local community groups respond to testing of citizenship question
By Natalie Weber

The U.S. Census Bureau’s testing of a citizenship question is meant to help increase response rates for the 2020 census, but local community leaders are concerned it could exacerbate confusion within Houston immigrant communities. They are using the summer to plan how to best encourage participation in the 2020 census.
Jannette Diep, executive director of nonprofit Boat People SOS-Houston, said the organization is going to keep an eye out for questionnaires to help people in Houston’s Vietnamese community respond if needed.
“We honestly [have] no understanding of why they are doing the testing to begin with, and I’m pretty sure people are going to be confused about that,” Diep said.
On June 13, the Census Bureau began sending out test questionnaires to 480,000 households across the country, including some in Houston. Half of the households will receive questionnaires with a citizenship question. The purpose of the testing, census officials have said, is not to determine whether a citizenship question will be included on the 2020 census. Rather, it is meant to help them identify areas where additional outreach may be needed if a citizenship question is added, and to measure how that change could impact response rates.
The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the citizenship question case in April and is expected to issue a ruling any day now.
But either way, there’s a specific challenge in Houston, community organizers say.
“People are hearing ‘census’ and they’re hearing ‘citizenship’ and with the political climate in Texas, they’re like ‘Oh, so with the citizenship question, does that mean that if I’m not a citizen, that information is going to be given to ICE or put into the wrong hands?’” said Kendra Baldazo, the worker justice organizer for Fe y Justicia Worker Center in Houston.
Hyunja Norman, president of the Korean American Voters League, said many people within the local Korean American community are likely unaware of the citizenship question testing. Some people may not even be aware that a citizenship question is being considered by the Supreme Court.
“Many people do not know about the Census 2020,” she said.
Norman said the voters league is partnering with churches attended by Korean residents to educate people about the census.
Mi Familia Vota, a national organization that focuses on civic engagement, has worked with Latino high schoolers in Houston to inform families about why they should complete the census, regardless of a citizenship question.
“There’s just been general confusion about the census,” said Karina Martínez, director of communications for the organization.
Currently, Mi Familia Vota is focusing on forming committees to organize census outreach. They do not plan to do any fieldwork specifically targeting the citizenship question testing this summer, and so far, have not heard of any of their Texas clients receiving the test questionnaire. However, the organization is a plaintiff in a case challenging the citizenship question to prevent what they fear may result in “a massive undercount.”
“People don’t want to provide their information to this administration,” Martínez said.
The Census Bureau said in a statement Friday the testing is meant to help the organization raise response rates.
“Approximately 480,000 housing unit addresses included in the test will help fine-tune the planning for the 2020 Census Nonresponse Followup operation, which is designed to collect responses from addresses that do not self-respond,” the statement said. It will also help the bureau’s “outreach campaign to maximize self-response to the 2020 census.”
Dudley Poston, a professor of sociology at Texas A&M University, said testing response rates is pretty standard for the Census Bureau.
“Some of the testing could be confusing,” he said. “But that’s part of the whole process of the testing that’s going on.”
Even raising the possibility of a citizenship question has caused confusion for some members of Latinx immigrant communities, Baldazo said.
Right now, Fe y Justicia is waiting to see if any members of the communities they serve have received the test census, said Information Center Organizer Jessica Lorena Rangel.
The worker center has also been working with Houston in Action, a local civic engagement coalition, and plans to ask people whether they will complete the census, and what they know about the census.
“I think community members aren’t necessarily aware that there is testing going on which is kind of concerning,” Rangel said. “And it kind of gives us a bit of an understanding of if we don’t work on that situation now what the results are going to be when the actual census does come out.”"

Katy ISD removes citizenship question from registration materials
By Shelby Webb

Officials in the Katy Independent School District this week removed a mandatory question from its online new-student enrollment materials that asked parents whether their students were U.S. citizens, a question some advocates said could have scared parents from enrolling their kids amid the increasingly fractious national debate over immigration driven by the Trump administration’s rhetoric and border enforcement policies.
District spokeswoman Maria Corrales DiPetta said Thursday the question was only asked of those enrolling students who were new to the district.
“Although responses to that question have never prevented a student from enrolling in Katy ISD, the question was immediately removed from the online form,” DiPetta wrote.
The question was removed after the Houston Chronicle asked the district about it Wednesday.
Edgar Saldivar, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas, said the question implies that the ability to enroll in school is tied to whether children are U.S. citizens. Districts deny immigrants of an equal access to an education by requiring families to divulge their citizenship status because it may discourage them from enrolling their children in school, he said.
“Denying noncitizens equal access is not only illegal, but in today’s political climate, which is rife with toxic anti-immigrant rhetoric by state and national leaders, it is also irresponsible,” Saldivar said in a statement. “Many Latinx and immigrant families in Texas now live in a constant state of angst, fearful that family members or friends could be targets of immigration enforcement.”
Public schools are required to educate all students, regardless of immigration status, because of the 1982 Plyler v. Doe U.S. Supreme Court decision. Courts have used that ruling to overturn policies and laws that justices wrote could dampen the involvement of immigrant and undocumented students.
Most recently, a federal appeals court in 2011 temporarily blocked part of an Alabama law that required schools to ask about students’ legal immigration status. Although state and school officials told parents students would not be barred from schools due to their immigration status, and that police would not take action against students identified as being in the country illegally, scores of mostly Hispanic students began leaving the state’s schools. Data showed more than 13 percent of Hispanic students withdrew from Alabama schools within months.
Officials in Alabama eventually revised the law that mandated the student immigration status question amid pressure from business, religious, immigration and education leaders.
While Plyler v Doe bars school districts from discriminating against students on the basis of their immigration status, it remains unclear whether simply asking about it is illegal, said Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards.
“Merely asking the question has been offered as a concern by advocacy groups like MALDEF (the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund), and those advocacy groups in their literature advise against asking the question. For that reason, the majority don’t answer that question,” Baskin said. “But asking the particular question without taking any steps to discriminate, exclude, charge money, etcetera, that really has not been clearly answered.”
Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, said asking about citizenship could act as a deterrent for immigrant or undocumented students enrolling in schools, creating a discriminatory barrier.
“It’s not just policies that prohibit enrollment but policies that would deter enrollment,” Saenz said. “It’s not a stretch to say this question could deter enrollment.”
In guidance to school districts, the Texas Education Agency’s website cites a 2015 joint letter by the U.S. departments of education and justice in which officials advised public schools to refrain from inquiring into students’ citizenship or immigration status or that of their parents or guardians.
However, districts are required by TEA to collect some specific immigration information about students, including how many students have refugee or asylum status and whether they or their parents have performed seasonal or temporary agricultural work in the past three years. The latter reporting requirement is for the Migrant Education Program, which provides additional resources to students to some farm workers’ families.
Districts may ask additional information about students’ time in the United States, Baskin said, such as how long they have attended schools in the country, in order to qualify for certain federal programs and grants.
“It is such a fine line, isn’t it?” Baskin said. “I think it must be really confusing to parents who see those questions on the forms and are wondering, ‘Are you asking this because you’re out to get me, or why?’”
Although parents sometimes can skip those immigration-related questions on registration materials, new Katy ISD parents could only select “yes” or “no” in response to the since-removed U.S. citizenship question. They could not continue to the next page to finish the application without providing an answer to that question.
Humble ISD spokeswoman Jamie Mount said the citizenship question was part of a template provided by a vendor that district uses. Katy and several other area districts use the same vendor.
“We reviewed the form for compliance within state requirements and had it (the question) removed before any families began filling out the form,” Mount said. “TEA states in the Student Attendance Accounting Handbook ‘In establishing whether a student meets residency requirements for enrollment in your district, your district must not ask about the citizenship or immigration status of the student or his or her parent.’”
A spokesman for the vendor, however, said its template does not include questions regarding citizenship.
Officials in Houston, Cypress-Fairbanks, Alief, Conroe, Klein, Spring and Clear Creek ISDs said their enrollment applications do not include questions about students’ citizenship. Clear Creek ISD asks for a copy of students’ birth certificates, which a spokesperson said can be from any country.
Katy, Alief and Spring ISDs ask for, but do not require, students’ Social Security numbers. If a student does not provide one, Alief ISD create a unique code to ensure the student is not double-enrolled in their systems. Katy ISD officials said students still can enroll without a Social Security or a state-approved alternate identification number.
Baskin said that is common practice in school districts, and that parents are not required to give schools their children’s Social Security information.
Cesar Espinosa, executive director of immigrant advocacy group FIEL, said even students who are U.S. citizens may have been dissuaded from enrolling in Katy ISD schools if any of their relatives are in the country illegally, a fear he has heard expressed across the region. He compared the question on Katy ISD’s enrollment documents to a now-scrapped question about citizenship the Trump administration proposed adding to the U.S. Census in 2020. Federal officials dropped the question after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration “contrived” a rationale for adding it.
Espinosa said the Census question could have led to an undercount in areas that, like Houston, have a large number of immigrant residents and would have resulted in the area getting fewer resources and, perhaps, less representation in Congress. He said something similar could happen if schools begin asking about citizenship.
“We welcome the fact the question was taken down, but just like the Census citizenship question, it may make people hesitant to answer or enroll,” Espinosa said. “School districts and schools could lose money and resources because these folks are already in your community.”"

Talento Bilingue de Houston is on the verge of insolvency. Latino leaders are determined to save one of the arts and culture group.
By Olivia P. Tallet

Hispanic artists and community leaders are seeking local government support to save Talento Bilingue de Houston, one of the city’s oldest Latino arts and culture institutions, which has lost its nonprofit status and is on the brink of insolvency.
The 42-year-old organization will be forced to close by the end of the month unless the city or Harris County steps in with planning and financial help, said Richard Rodriguez, a business owner leading a newly elected board tasked with saving the organization.
“It would be a shame if this legacy Latino arts center shuts down during Hispanic Heritage Month,” a national celebration observed from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, Rodriguez said.
In the aftermath of the Aug. 3 mass shooting targeting Hispanics that killed 22 people in El Paso, as well as “national rhetoric stereotyping Latinos,” Rodriguez said, “we need to step up to elevate the visibility of our culture through the arts … instead of losing our institutions.”
Talento Bilingue was founded “to educate all by preserving, presenting and promoting Latino culture,” according to its mission statement. It has focused mostly on performing arts, presenting plays ranging from classic works to original plays with Latino twists. Many were written by Richard Reyes, a former director of the organization and one of its main promoters.
Several of its theater and dance productions have toured around the country, with its youth theater serving as an incubator for talent and community awareness. According to Reyes, several alumni became successful artists or civic leaders, such as Rodney Alejandro, a musician who worked for the Golden Globe-winning TV series “The Shield,” and state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston.
Talento Bilingue has also served as a venue for local readings and workshops, including programs of Nuestra Palabra: Latino Writers Having Their Say, founded in 1998 in Houston. It has struggled, however, with lack of funding, mismanagement and controversies.
In 1995, it received a $980,000 federal grant to build its theater and community center in Second Ward, next to Guadalupe Plaza Park east of downtown. The organization later received financial help from public and private sources, but still has suffered from a shortage of operating funds.
This year, Talento Bilingue received just $5,000 from the city — $4,000 in February for an after-school program, and $1,000 in June from a district council office, Rodriguez said.
Locally and nationally, Hispanic arts and cultural leaders have long complained of a lack of funding for Latino institutions.
A study published last year by the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures found that while Latinos represent more than 40 percent of the Houston population, only 7 percent of the funds allocated by the Houston Arts Alliance went to Hispanic art and culture stakeholders between 2010 and 2015,.
The alliance distributes the largest share of funds from the city’s hotel occupancy tax, which supplies most local arts funding. The study concluded that the data “reveals dramatic inequity in funding of Houston Latinx arts” during that period.
The city has improved funding for Latino art and culture organizations and “will continue to do so,” a spokesman for Mayor Sylvester Turner said.
Alan Bernstein, Turner’s communications director, noted an investment of $265,000 in artist grants during the “Smithsonian Latino Art Now!” conference in April hosted by the University of Houston’s Center for Mexican American Studies. Of the top 10 Arts Alliance grant recipients of 2019, eight are organizations of color and two are Latino, Bernstein said.
Some Latino cultural leaders in Houston recognize Turner’s efforts.
“In all fairness, a lot of the inequities and structural discriminations that the NALAC study mentioned occurred before (Turner’s) administration,” said Tony Diaz, the leader of Nuestra Palabra.
Continual changes in leadership and poor management also have played a role in bringing the organization to the brink of bankruptcy, its new leaders say.
Talento Bilingue recently lost its nonprofit status for failing to file its tax form, known as 990, to the Internal Revenue Service for three consecutive years under the administration of Executive Director Javier Perez, who was fired by the newly installed board about six weeks ago.
Perez also was involved in a controversy over alleged sexual harassment toward a former TBH volunteer worker, part of which was caught on video. Rodriguez, the new board leader, said he discovered that Perez sued the accuser in his own and the organization’s names without authorization from the institution.
The Houston Chronicle’s efforts to reach Perez were unsuccessful.
Some Latino leaders see the management deficiencies as evidence that a lack of financial support generates a cycle of dysfunction.
“The problem of bad administration here falls squarely on the lap of the funding agencies,” said chef and writer Adán Medrano, a Houston-based board member of the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures.
“We have strong legacy organizations that are very hard to sustain because we have been blocked from the financial capital,” Medrano said. “It means that we don’t have the ability to hire good finance officers, development officers, grant writers or administrators that can keep bookkeeping and other tasks in line in the same way that mainstream organizations with money can do.”
The new board created a plan to save the organization, in part by transferring its contract to Nuestra Palabra. The idea was applauded at a recent meeting at Talento Bilingue attended by more than 100 artists and stakeholders. Several speakers expressed concerns that the building, owned by the city of Houston, could be passed to a non-Hispanic organization.
“Nuestra Palabra should be supported as the new operator of TBH because of its longevity in the community, the years of serving the community and being respected by the community,” Medrano said.
The city would have to authorize such a transfer. Board members and Diaz said they had discussed the matter with the mayor.
“Turner told me he wants to support our cause, Latino arts,” Diaz said.
The mayor’s office said no decision had been made regarding another organization assuming operation of the space.
Latino leaders expressed determination to save Talento Bilingue.
“We are not going to lose this theater. We are going to stay united, and we are going to win,” artist Karen Martinez said at the recent meeting.
“We sustain our identity and sense of community through the arts and culture,” said Medrano, the author. “But when you have a vacuum of representation and support, and your strong art and culture is not seen where it should, then we have this horrible victimization and violence that we saw in El Paso.
“There is not a strong counter-message to what we have seen; we need the values of our art to be supported and shown, loudly.”
Diaz said Hispanic Heritage Month is an apt time to fight for the cultural capital of Latinos in Houston.
“We demand respect; we demand to be at the table for decisions about investments in the arts from the appropriate entities; we demand support for the cultural capital of our community,” Diaz said. “This issue of lack of funding and support will be solved, and it will be either a party or a protest; I hope it’s a celebration.”"

Rhor: Why I changed my mind about Hispanic Heritage Month [Opinion]
By Monica Rhor

Honestly, I usually dread Hispanic Heritage Month.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m proud of being Latina. But I’ve never embraced the government-created commemoration — a 30-day span when, after months of near invisibility, Latinx culture is suddenly showcased in front page stories and festivals filled with folkloric dancers. Mi gente should be represented in society and in history year-round.
This year, though, 22 people were killed in an anti-Latino terror attack, by a gunman with a professed mission of killing as many Mexicans as possible.
This year, children who look like my family were wrenched away from mothers who could be me or my cousins or my sisters and housed in filthy border patrol facilities with conditions so horrendous doctors and lawyers broke down in tears.
Latinx people have been cursed at and assaulted for speaking Spanish in public. We’ve been told to “go back” to our countries and threatened with deportation even when we’re U.S.-born. We’ve been notified that we’re excluded from the Statue of Liberty’s embrace of those “yearning to breathe free.”
So, this year, I’m hoisting my Latinx banner high — and joining Tony Diaz, founder of Nuestra Palabra: Latino Writers Having Their Say, in his call for the occasion to be marked by schools, municipalities, museums and media. He’s even promoting a hashtag — #Art4HHM, short for Art for Hispanic Heritage Month — as a rallying cry.
“We just suffered a direct attack on Latinos in El Paso. And it's clear from the manifesto that the terrorist left behind that his hatred was fueled by the racism stoked by stereotypes,” Diaz told me. “Right now, it's clear stereotypes are killing us.”
The best way to counter the negative images and misconceptions is through representation. As Diaz says, “Art and culture humanize us.”
We need to see the full spectrum of the Latinx experience reflected in the art we view, the books we read, the history we learn, the movies we watch.
The name Macario Garcia, a U.S. Army staff sergeant and the first Mexican immigrant awarded a Medal of Honor for heroism during World War II, should be a household name, and especially in the Houston area where he and his wife raised their children. The works of Piri Thomas, the Cuban-Puerto_Rican writer who chronicled coming of age in Harlem, should be taught in English classes alongside Harper Lee.
The plot lines of Hollywood productions should brim with characters inspired by the diverse, growing Latinx population. How about a family drama about a multi-generational Dominican clan which splits its time between New York and Florida? Or a rom-com about an Ecuadorean museum curator and a cartoonist? Or a seriocomic saga about a Latinx college grad on a road trip with her mami?
The last, by the way, is taken from my own life. In fact, all of the above pitches are inspired by people I know.
My social circle includes Latinx folks born in Latin America and those whose families have been in the U.S. for generations, college professors and high school teachers, financial advisers and photographers, factory workers and postal carriers. Not a gang banger or cartel boss in the bunch.
But you won’t see those stories mirrored in movies. On the big screen, characters who resemble me, my friends and my family are virtually non-existent.
The first time I saw characters who felt plucked from my life — in Gregory Nava’s “My Family/Mi Familia” — it felt like a gulp of water after a desert trek. I felt en casa. At home.
Nearly 25 years later, such characters are still rare.
Latinos are 18.8 percent of the U.S. population and accounted for 23 percent of movie ticket sales.
Yet, according to recent study from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, Latinx actors made up only 4.5 percent of the speaking roles in more than 1,200 movies from 2007-2018. Nearly half had no Latinx speaking roles at all.
Worse, more than a quarter of Latinx characters were criminals — gang members, drug dealers, murderers, ex-cons — and 17 percent of speaking roles for Latinx actors depicted poor or low-income characters.
The majority of Latinx characters exist “without any cultural artifacts, symbols, or references to the characters’ ethnic group.” They are just cardboard caricatures with Latinx surnames, not complex, nuanced portrayals of real people.
That’s how stereotypes thrive.
If Latinx people are only visible in movies and TV as lawbreakers, then it’s too easy for some to accept the president’s dismissal of Mexicans as criminals.
If films and history books don’t trumpet the triumphs of Latinx war heroes or frame the lives of Latinx families as everyday Americans, then it is too easy to view immigrant communities as “invaders.”
If Latinx children don’t see themselves on big screens, then it is too easy for them to feel “less than,” to believe the ugly images and words hurled at them.
We need to make it hard for the Latinx community to be erased, profiled and put down. Hispanic Heritage Month is as good a time as any to replace the stereotypes with truth, and bit parts with real people."

Environmental racism: It’s real and Democratic candidates must show how they’ll address it [Opinion]
By Robert D. Bullard

The effects of racism on our country and in our communities have been a welcome topic during the Democratic primary race. From the impacts of policing to education to economic opportunity — even to busing — we have seen candidates discussing how to confront the enduring legacy of racist policies.
But a form of systemic oppression — one that holds back our community, sickens our children and cuts our lives short — has been nearly absent from the debate stage: environmental racism. It is fitting that the party’s next debate will be at Texas Southern University, where pioneering legal theories and sociological research in the 1970s laid the foundation for the national environmental justice movement.
My four decades of environmental justice research show that millions of Americans have the “wrong complexion for protection.” ZIP code is a better predictor of health than genetic code. Race is still more potent than income in predicting the distribution of pollution. This is not just a Texas problem. People of color in 46 states live with more air pollution than whites, Environmental Protection Agency scientists found in 2018.
For decades, communities of color in Houston and across the nation have borne a disproportionate burden from this toxic threat. A recent study, for example, found that African Americans are exposed to about 56 percent more pollution than is caused through their consumption of goods and services. For Latinx people, it is even higher, at 63 percent. It’s time for whites to stop dumping their pollution on poor and people of color communities.
This pollution inequality is not accidental. Local, state and federal policies enforced segregation, prevented access to reasonably priced mortgages and starved black communities of resources. Governments and companies, meanwhile, followed this path of least resistance, placing far too many landfills, petrochemical plants and metal recyclers, among other major pollution sources, in and around our neighborhoods.
This leads to sacrifice zones, places where people, mostly of color and low wealth, live beside hyperpolluters and in harm’s way. In Houston, for example, an oil refinery, chemical plant and Interstate 610 surround the Manchester neighborhood, home to roughly 3,000 people. Not surprisingly, the cancer risk for people living in Manchester and neighboring Harrisburg is 22 percent higher than for the overall Houston urban area, according to a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists and Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services.
Climate change exacerbates this cruel and unjust situation. When Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water across Houston, it also damaged several petrochemical facilities in communities of color and low wealth, sending millions of pounds of harmful pollution into the air. The storm-damaged refinery in Manchester released a plume of cancer-causing benzene into the neighborhood. They had no idea what they were breathing because of slow-footed response by the EPA and state regulators.
The sad truth is that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent.
A warming world also can harm our health and the health of our children by increasing the number of “bad air” days and asthma attacks. That’s because climate change enhances conditions that lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog, the lung-burning pollutant that can trigger asthma attacks.
In Texas, the prevalence of asthma is already greater among African American adults than among white adults. With children, the rate is roughly the same, but studies show black children were hospitalized for asthma three times more often than white children. They suffer at higher rates for many reasons, such as less access to medical care in their communities, including fewer nurses in their schools.
People of color and low wealth also are likely to have less refuge from the extreme heat that is already smothering Southeast Texas. They may work outside. They may be unable to afford air conditioning or medical care, leaving them more exposed to the warming world.
This is a critical moment, and we need those seeking the presidency to define bold climate solutions, such as those included in the Equitable and Just Climate Platform. They must explain how they will move our nation, our shared home, to an economy with 100 percent clean energy while creating jobs and protecting the most vulnerable from the brunt of devastating health and economic impacts.
As the Democratic contenders prepare to debate here Thursday, they would do well to listen to the people in Houston neighborhoods who are exposed to the highest levels of toxic pollution and are on the front lines of climate change — and then tell us how they plan to bring environmental and economic justice to all Americans, especially our most vulnerable communities."

Annova LNG lands $373 million tax abatement
By Sergio Chapa

Cameron County commissioners on Tuesday approved a $373 million tax abatement deal for Houston liquefied natural gas company Annova LNG to build an export terminal at the Port of Brownsville.
Some 80 supporters and 50 opponents of the controversial LNG export project packed Cameron County Commissioners Court meeting. After hearing dozens of public comments from both sides, commissioners voted 3-2 in favor of the 10-year tax deal.
Under the agreement, Annova LNG will make a one-time payment of $5.5 million for community projects as well as 10 annual payments of $500,000 to the county in lieu of taxes. The deal holds as long at the company employs more than 100 people and ensures that at least 35 of them of them are local hires.
“We both have a vision for a better and brighter future for Cameron County,” Annova LNG CEO Omar Khayum told commissioners. “How do we deliver it? We create jobs. Sustainable, high-paying jobs.”
Annova LNG is one of three liquefied natural gas companies seeking to build export terminals in Brownsville. Annova’s project, which is awaiting approval from federal regulators, will produce and export up to 6 milion metric tons of LNG per year. But the project and those proposed by two other Houston companies — NextDecade and Texas LNG — face stiff opposition from a coalition of shrimpers, fishermen, environmentalists, neighbors and communities working under the banner Save RGV from LNG.
Citing environmental and safety concerns, opponents have vowed to continue the fight.
“By approving this terrible tax break deal, Cameron County commissioners failed their constituents who will bear the costs of Annova LNG’s polluting facility,” said Rebekah Hinojosa, a organizer for the Sierra Club, a national environmental advocacy group that is part of the coalition. “The communities of South Padre Island, Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, and Long Island Village, have all passed anti-LNG resolutions. Annova LNG would pollute Latinx communities and poses a huge environmental risk to the Rio Grande Valley.”
The tax abatement vote split the court with commissioners Sofia Benavides, Joey Lopez and Gus Ruiz voting in favor and Commissioner David Garza and County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr. voting against it. Two years earlier, the commission voted 4-1 in favor of giving a similar tax abatement to NextDecade.
Supporters of the tax break for Annova said the project will provide a needed boost to the local economy, creating 700 construction jobs over 54 months, representing $324 million in payroll. The Rio Grande Valley is one of the poorest areas in Texas.
But Maria Galassio, a resident of Laguna Vista and Save RGV From LNG member, said she was disappointed by the commissioner’s court. “I feel the Cameron County Commissioners Court dropped the ball again,” Galassio said in a statement.
Launched in 2013 and headquartered in Houston, Annova LNG is owned by a consortium of four companies. Chicago utility Exelon owns 80.55 percent while Enbridge, the Canadian pipeline company, holds a 10.5 percent stake. Nebraska engineering, procurement and construction firm Kiewit and Kansas energy technology firm Black & Veatch each own 4.475 percent.
Annova LNG has not sold contracts for any of its planned production. Khayum said the facility would need commitments from customers to buy about two-thirds of its annual production — 4 million of 6 million metric tons — before the company can make a final decision to go forward with the project.
Annova, NextDecade and Texas LNG are still waiting on federal permit decisions, but environmental reviews of the projects expressed concern about the cumulative traffic, noise and habitat fragmentation they would have on the endangered ocelot, jaguarundi and aplomado falcon if all three projects are built.
In an environmental review, regulators said concerns for Annova LNG as a single project could be overcome through the proper mitigation efforts. Annova LNG has pledged to use noise and pollution-reducing electric motors for its plant and to develop an 185-acre wildlife corridor. The company plans to build a concrete wall along the boundary of the wildlife corridor that will further reduce noise and light — and keep animals out of the plant.
Last month, Annova LNG went another step further and pledged get all 405 megawatts of electricity for its proposed export terminal from renewable sources such as wind and solar.
“When Annova LNG comes online, we will have the lowest carbon footprint of any U.S. LNG provider, and quite possibly the lowest carbon footprint of any LNG provider in the world,” Khayum told commissioners. “Annova LNG — and therefore Cameron County — will be a national and global leader in developing the sustainable jobs of the future. That is something we should all be proud of.”"

Six myths about Latino Republicans are challenged in University of Houston study
By Taylor Goldenstein

Latinos tend to be Democrats? Latinos who are Republican must be moderates and not feel welcome within the party?
A new University of Houston study seeks to debunk these common misconceptions about Latino voters.
The growing community in Texas will play a key role in the 2020 election, said Brandon Rottinghaus, lead author of the study and a political science professor at the university.
“The Latinx vote will be the decisive part of the 2020 election,” Rottinghaus said, using a gender-neutral term for the demographic group. “Republicans have long counted on a base of support from the Latinx community. If they don’t hold that support in 2020, Texas will turn blue.”
Here are some of the myths Rottinghaus and co-author Rudy Fonseca, field director for the Harris County Republican Party, examined:
Myth: Latinos are natural Democrats.
Study results: Texas is not like most other states when it comes to Latino support. Twenty-seven percent of Hispanic people in Texas identified with the Republican party, a 2014 Gallup poll showed, compared to 21 percent in all other states at the time.
Whether Republicans will be able to retain that support is still unclear. A September 2019 University of Houston and Univision poll showed that most Latinos — 69 percent — say they’ll vote or are leaning toward voting for a Democratic candidate, while 19 percent said they plan to support or are leaning toward supporting President Donald Trump.
Myth: Latino Republicans are less conservative than other Republicans.
Study results: While it’s true polling has shown Latino Republicans identify as less conservative than other Republicans in Texas, they don’t identify more often as moderates. Still, they are less likely to identify as being extremely Republican.
A Texas Tribune poll from October 2016 showed Latino Republicans were more likely to self-identify as “somewhat conservative” than all Republicans. Thirty-seven percent of all Republicans saw themselves as “extremely conservative” as opposed to 19 percent of Latino Republicans.
This split is important, the study authors noted, because if the GOP continues to move further to the right, they risk losing more moderate Latino voters.
Myth: Latino Republicans are growing more moderate as Republican Party rhetoric grows more conservative.
Study results: That same Texas Tribune poll in 2018 showed Latino Republicans are actually more likely to identify as “extremely conservative” than the previous poll showed — with 27 percent identifying as such last year compared to 19 percent in 2016.
Latino Republicans are indeed less likely than other Republicans to support Trump’s handling of border security (43 percent approved compared to 58 percent of all Republicans), trade negotiations (50 percent versus 61 percent of all Republicans) and judicial nominees (48 percent versus 71 percent).
Sixty-three percent of Latino Republicans said they thought “Trump cares about people like you” and 68 percent said they thought “Trump has the temperament to effectively serve as president,” while 80 percent of all Republicans agreed with those statements.
Myth: Latinos only support the Republican Party because they are culturally conservative.
Study results: This is true, but there are other factors that engender Latino Republican support. Some of those less-often-discussed factors include home ownership, having lived in the U.S. for multiple generations and higher incomes.
Myth: Latino Republicans are “softer” on illegal voting and immigration than other Republicans.
Study results: While the 2016 Texas Tribune poll showed they tend to view such issues as less serious, they are still closer in their views to fellow Republicans than to Democrats.
One exception is deportation: The poll showed 19 percent of Latino Republicans “strongly agreed” with the statement that “undocumented immigrants should be deported immediately,” as opposed to 35 percent of all Republicans.
This, too, could be changing: 34 percent of Latino Republicans “strongly agreed” with that statement in 2018, as support similarly increased among all Republicans to 48 percent.
Myth: Latinos don’t feel welcome in the Republican Party.
Study results: This would appear to be false. The 2016 Texas Tribune poll showed that 61 percent of self-identified Latino Republicans felt welcome compared to 68 percent of all Republicans.
Meanwhile, Latino Republicans were more likely than other Republicans to see the Democratic Party as welcoming (20 percent as opposed to 8 percent of all Republicans). Just 4 percent of Latino Democrats felt welcome in the Republican Party, the poll showed.
There’s room for improvement in the Republican Party: The September 2019 University of Houston and Univision poll showed that 56 percent of Texas Latinos think Democratic candidates are “doing a good job” reaching out to their community. Just 22 percent of Texas Latinos thought the Republican candidates were doing the same."

A less diverse Harvard isn’t a win for Asian Americans [Opinion]
By Jeannie Park

“You silent dumb sheep.” “Cowards.” “You’re like black slaveholders.” “Uncle Chan.” Those are a few of the names that I and other Harvard alumni colleagues who defended race-conscious admissions have been called over the past two years. The sheep line made us laugh. The slaveholder analogy made us outraged. And then there was the time I was yelled at by two Asian American men —one in each ear — as I and others walked off the stage at a black-tie gala; one of the men told me later, “I’m so disappointed in you. Our children are going to be worse off because of you.” That stung.
But that’s what you get for stepping into the racially charged lawsuit against Harvard University admissions accusing the college of discriminating against Asian American applicants as it sought to foster racial diversity on campus. The two alumni groups I help lead —one Asian American, one multiracial — stood in support of diversity and race-conscious admissions, as do most Asian Americans. Alongside 23 other student and alumni groups, we signed amicus briefs and wrote affidavits, and our members took the witness stand. We were relieved that U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs’ recent decision powerfully affirmed the need for the consideration of race in admissions and methodically dismissed the claim of discrimination. But the intense emotions provoked by the suit, which exploited nearly every stereotype out there about Asian Americans, will not subside soon.
I believe the case turned into a lightning rod for the anger that many Asian Americans have felt at the real and sometimes violent racism we face. In a country that mostly sees race as black and white, or black and brown and white, the indignities we suffer as immigrants and descendants of immigrants who are viewed as perpetual foreigners (Yes, I speak good English, I was born in Cincinnati, dammit!) are often invisible. So here was a chance to give the finger to the Man, while still hoping our kid gets into his supposedly law-breaking college.
But here’s what I came to see: The Man is still so supreme that even if it felt like this lawsuit might take him down, it was actually advancing his ultimate agenda — to maintain power and keep us down — by turning us against each other.
In the Harvard case, there’s a specific man, conservative activist Edward Blum. Blum, who said he “needed Asian plaintiffs” for the suit he was spearheading against Harvard, is the same man who catalyzed the Shelby County case that resulted in a Supreme Court decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act. Blum and his organization also filed an amicus brief supporting adding the citizenship question to the 2020 Census.
So why would we align ourselves with someone who is working against our greater interest? I’m also puzzled when Asian Americans don’t see that race-conscious programs are still needed for so many of us, especially once we get beyond the college walls. The #HollywoodSoWhite and#StarringJohnCho campaigns have highlighted how few Asian Americans are represented in popular culture. And more broadly, though we enter the workforce in high numbers, we are the least likely to get promoted to management positions. For years, I facilitated a leadership program for the Asian American Journalists Association — the type of race-shaped program that bumped more of us toward the head of the newsroom but also the kind of program that diversity opponents would like to banish. Saying the country’s policies should be race-blind actually means cementing the status quo, which favors one race and one gender.
What was most gratifying about Burroughs’ decision was the number of times she cited testimony from alumni and student witnesses who spoke vividly about how inextricable race was from their lives and their identities — and thus their college applications. They were black and Latinx and Asian American, but their moving stories shared a theme: what it feels like to be marginalized and how race-consciousness was an important part of the solution, which Burroughs stirringly echoed.
The most profound lesson for me of these past two years is that alumni and students could come together across generations, across race and ethnicity, religion, gender and across all the other boundaries that can divide us to fight for what’s right. Today’s students are better off with the splendid diversity around them. And if they can stay united, maybe they will finally upend the status quo and bring us closer to a society that truly offers equal opportunity for all. That’s the real American dream my parents handed me when they left everything they knew on the far side of the Pacific Ocean more than 60 years ago. It wasn’t about getting into Harvard, and it shouldn’t be."

Actor is challenged by starring roles in back-to-back Purple Box plays
By Don Maines

Manny Martinez has been flying high with starring roles in back-to-back plays at Purple Box Theater in Friendswood.
But inside, the 22-year-old Pearland resident has wrestling with the challenge of keeping both parts straight.
“I am trying to keep my balance with a lot of hope, but if you could hear what I’m feeling, you would probably go deaf,” Martinez said.
Martinez plays Clifford, the Christopher Reeve role, in Ira Levin’s “Deathtrap” Oct. 18-27 and Paul, the Robert Redford part, in Neil Simon’s “Barefoot in the Park” Nov. 1-10.
“I liken it to being a bird that’s afraid of to fly, but I have to fly,” he said.
The son of Julio Martinez and Miroslava Garza committed to theater at Pearland High School when his teacher, Andrea Mashman, cast him in the starring role of “Frankenstein.”
“I had done a number of shows, but I was also on the cross-country team,” said the 2015 graduate, who now attends Houston Community College. “When I got the leading role, I put all my chips in theater.”
After high school, Martinez served 3½ years in the U.S. Navy. For part of that time, he was engaged to be married, which gave him some insight into his role as half of a recently wed young couple in “Barefoot in the Park.”
“They have a lot of arguments and petty squabbles, and we had many of them,” said the actor. When his engagement ended, Martinez said, “C’est la vie.”
In the 1963 romantic comedy, Paul and Corie (portrayed by Mylana Valdina of Friendswood) try to keep their marriage afloat in the midst of some wacky supporting characters, who are played by Deborah Winters Chaney and Matt Rosenthal, also of Friendswood; Xavier Gutierrez of League City; and Alex Crouse of Galveston.
They are directed by Cathy Holbrook, with Rhonda Bailes and Monica Bunch as stage managers.
Holbrook said, “The show is one of my favorites of Neil Simon. The writing is clever and entertaining. This cast really brings the characters to life and engages you from the very start. You feel like you have known them for a very long time and are part of the family. It's a very entertaining two hours.”
“Deathtrap” was directed by Jeff Coletta of League City. The mystery-thriller co-stars Phil Connolly, Barbara Brandt, David Schultze and Lorie Alcazar.
Martinez called Neil Simon comedies “a staple of the silent majority of Americans” but added that he is especially interested in appearing in and developing productions that mirror the culture of Hispanic Americans.
“For example, I read ‘Zoot Suit’ in college,” he said, referring to a play by Luis Valdez based on a World War II-era murder case.
“I would like to branch out in Latinx roles,” he added, explaining that Latinx (pronounced La-TEEN-ex) is an inclusive, gender-neutral term."

New technology to combat HIV [Opinion]
By Elia Chino

In 1989, my best friend, Gustavo Garcia De La Vega from Mexico City, died of AIDS. I received the news two weeks after he passed away. In 1993, Ed Wells from the Church of Christ in Houston, who was like a second father to me, passed away and nobody told me. I found out two weeks later when I called his wife and she told me that he died from that disease called “AIDS.” I didn’t know anything about AIDS. I didn’t even know that condoms existed.
During that time in Houston, so many people were dying in their friends’ houses from complications related to the disease because they were afraid to talk about AIDS with their families, partners and communities. I saw firsthand how many were taken by the disease when I volunteered at Ben Taub Hospital and held people as they took their last breaths. I knew I needed to do something to help. That’s why, 25 years ago, I started the Fundación Latinoamericana Contra El SIDA Inc. That year, more than 48,000 people were newly infected with HIV in America. Given the stigma surrounding AIDS, we changed the name to Fundación Latinoamericana De Acción Social in 2013 and became FLAS.
Since 1994, the number of people diagnosed with HIV annually in the United States has decreased to 38,000. We’ve worked against impossible odds for decades to stop the spread of HIV. While this progress is remarkable, infection rates in marginalized communities continue to rise.
The face of HIV/AIDS is no longer white and urban. Southern states were home to 52 percent of new HIV diagnoses in 2018 despite being home to only 38 percent of the population. Latinx men who have sex with men saw a 24 percent increase in new HIV diagnoses from 2005 to 2014 while white men saw an 18 percent decline. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that among black men who have sex with men, 1 in 2 will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetimes and 1 in 4 Hispanic men who have sex with men. That compares with just 1 in 11 white men who have sex with men.
These disparities are unacceptable.
We have some understanding of why these disparities exist. Access to treatment is critical. About two-thirds of Americans living with HIV get medical treatment, but among the 251,700 Latinx people living with HIV, only about one-third receive care. Study after study finds that black and Latinx communities feel less comfortable talking about HIV and AIDS. This is further complicated by language barriers, and studies suggest the number of Spanish-speaking doctors is actually decreasing while the Latinx population grows.
Geography also plays an important role in access to care. Between 2013 and 2017, more than twice the number of rural hospitals closed than in any other five-year period. Texas closed more rural hospitals than any other state.
That’s why technology can play such an important, even life-saving, role in improving the health of our communities. We can bring quality, Spanish language, judgment-free health care to patients across the South through telehealth. It allows patients to receive quality, timely medical care and education, no matter where they live or how far the nearest doctor may be.
But location isn’t the only barrier. I once went to Mexico City to visit my friend’s mother. She warned me, “Take care of yourself because my son passed away from that horrible disease that kills people called AIDS.” Before he died, her son begged, “Please don’t tell my friends that I died from AIDS, and don’t allow anyone to see me at my funeral. I don’t want nobody to find out that I died from AIDS and see how I look as AIDS absorbs my body.”
Stigma is poisonous, and I am no stranger to its effects. As a trans woman who works in a border state to provide immigrants with treatment for one of the most stigmatized diseases in the world, doors don’t open easily for me. When I started FLAS, we struggled for years without funding. Fortunately, Houston is getting a big investment in prevention. Companies such as Gilead Sciences are funding the best local solutions to fight HIV and AIDS. In fact, Gilead’s COMPASS Initiative, which is providing more than $100 million over 10 years to organizations across the South, is helping FLAS debut Project REACH — a telehealth program to provide culturally competent care to Latinx people regardless of language, socioeconomic status or location.
I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, but I know we can do better. Telehealth can make culturally competent medical advice accessible to all, and Project Reach will focus on achieving this goal in Houston. We’ve come too far in our fight against HIV to stop now. Through public and private investment, communities throughout the South can employ innovative tactics to end the epidemic and help people live full and healthy lives — and telehealth represents the path forward."

Rice students who dressed up as ICE officers on campus spark outrage
Brittany Britto

Social media photos of three Rice University students dressed up as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers for a Halloween event on campus sparked outrage.
Photos, tweeted by Rice senior Daniel Pham Thursday, showed the students sporting shirts with the acronym “ICE” in bold white letters while waiting in line for a campus party that night. The tweet of their photos has since received more than 400 retweets, 1,500 likes and several comments as of 9 p.m. Friday and has caught the attention of university officials.
Rice President David Leebron tweeted that the students’ costumes “were remarkably insensitive given the present environment,” where many Rice students, including those covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, “are unsure about their safety in this country” or concerned about their relatives or friends who face deportation or separation from their families.
“Let us turn this distressing incident into positive action and express our concern and support … for our many students who are threatened by current immigration policy, especially our students of Latinx heritage,” Leebron tweeted. “It falls on all of us to be thoughtful in our actions and create a welcoming environment for all.”
Rice’s student newspaper, the Thresher, which identified the three students who wore the ICE costumes in an article Friday, reported that the students have apologized in a written statement to the newspaper. Two of the students who held leadership positions on campus have also resigned due to failure “to promote inclusivity for which our roles serve to facilitate,” according to the Thresher.
“We disregarded how fellow students would react and did not consider the safety and wellbeing of others,” they wrote to the Thresher. The students also acknowledged in their statement that their costumes led to a Twitter thread “where hate-speech was incited” and “opened the gates for further negative discourse,” though they stated that they did not participate in the online discussion.
The Thresher reported that the students will also participate in a town hall meeting Tuesday for their specific college, McMurtry, which will be facilitated by the college’s diversity council.
The Halloween incident follows the university’s efforts to educate its community, tackle issues such as race and exclusivity and address its own history. Earlier this year, the university announced the launch of a “Task Force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice” (university officials announced the task force members, which include Rice student, faculty and alumni, in a university-wide email on Friday). And in October, the university launched its Center for African and African American Studies — a first for the college.
Pham said the responses to his tweets showing the students in the insensitive costumes have largely been positive. The senior, who works at The Hoot, an on-campus student-run café, said he went to go visit some of his colleagues at nearby Willy’s Pub while taking a break from writing his paper. That’s when he saw the students, but at the time many people didn’t seem to notice the students’ costumes, he said.
“There wasn’t any loud happening in the line in regards to what they were wearing,” he said.
At least two students told the Thresher that they confronted the students that night.
“I continued to tell them why it was inappropriate for them to wear those costumes until they finally decided to take the letters off,” sophomore Mezthly Pena told the Thresher. “They got verbally aggressive with me so I left.”
Pena told the Thresher that she felt hurt by the students’ decisions to make light of such a serious issue.
“ICE is wreaking havoc on many families and causing a lot of death, and I just couldn’t understand why they would find it humorous,” Pena said. “I was also very disappointed that no one had said anything to them beforehand and that they had made it all the way into Pub with the costumes on.”
Pham decided to tweet out the photo to make people more aware of the situation, he said.
He said that even with the campus’s touted “culture of care” and the broader understanding that Rice is a “fairly liberal school … stuff like that still happens and those kind of opinions are still prevalent on campus.”
“There’s still work to be done,” Pham said."

Transgender Thanksgiving a loving, affirmative, safe space for the holiday
By Hannah Dellinger

Alexander Miller used to request to work the Thanksgiving shift at his retail job. He couldn’t tell his coworkers why he wouldn’t be with his family when they asked.
“Little did they know, I’m transgender and my family doesn’t accept me,” he said. “I think the holidays are supposed to be the happiest time of the year, but for a lot of people, especially trans people, it’s the saddest time of the year.”
Miller, who recently moved to Houston from Kentucky, celebrated the holiday for the first time in years at a Thanksgiving potluck for the transgender community Tuesday night at the Montrose Center.
“Nobody here is ashamed to be themselves,” said George Zemanek, a transgender man who organizes the dinner each year. “It’s a place where people can safely be who they are without that fear and shame.”
The longstanding tradition was established in the late 1990s by Brenda Thomas, a trans woman who was a pillar in the community. After her death in 2006, Zemanek wanted the tradition to continue in her honor.
After the community center where the event used to be held closed down, Zemanek began hosting the dinner in his own Houston home. Up until a few years ago when the dinner moved to the Montrose Center, about 10 people would attend. This year, about 100 people gathered for the meal.
“The history of all of the different letters of (the LGBTQ) community has been not having places to go on the holidays,” said Kennedy Lofton, chief development officer the Montrose Center. “Specifically, our trans brothers and sisters and others are really struggling during the holidays.”
More transgender people attend the center’s support groups and utilize the counseling it offers around the holidays, Lofton said.
Hosting an event specifically for transgender people is important, Zemanek said, because often celebrations of being trans are grouped into larger LGBTQ events. While being inclusive is a positive thing, Zemanek said it’s also crucial to recognize the individual identities within that community.
There are many factors that have made building a cohesive transgender community difficult, said Kaylee Senn, who runs the center’s support group for transgender people.
“As trans folks, a lot of times, we’ll be very involved in the community right when we’re transitioning because that’s when we’re most struggling and in need of resources,” she said. “A lot of folks, those who are successfully able to transition, just sort of disappear into the woodwork and we don’t really have that much of an organized community.”
Sometimes after people transition, Senn said they may not be out to the people around them. The real threats to the lives and rights of transgender people keep many from coming out, she added.
“I do think that if there were fewer overt risks everywhere you went, then maybe we would have a more out and visible trans community,” she said. “I would love to see that day come.”
The risks are especially dangerous for black transgender women, advocates say. Most of the 22 transgender people murdered so far in 2019 in the United States were black women. Three of the women were killed in Texas and one, Tracy Williams, lived in Houston.
“When you’re out here in the community, you literally have to look around and worry about what somebody’s intention is when they interact with you,” said Atlantis Narcisse, volunteer coordinator at the center and a black transgender woman.
Another obstacle to building a community is that some may not feel that being transgender is a defining personality trait, said Senn, so they don’t feel called to build a community with other transgender people.
“For so long, there’s been trans erasure,” said Lofton. “It’s been really difficult for that community themselves to create institutions as large as the Montrose Center.”
While it’s common for transgender people to be grouped into the larger LGBTQ community when it comes to organizing, there are also silos of specific groups within the trans community, Lofton said.
“Trans women of color will meet over here, and trans men will meet here...and our Latinx unauthorized immigrants will meet over here, and there are very few events like this that bring all of those intersections within the trans community together,” Lofton said.
Asher Ritz, a transgender man who identifies as nonbinary and attended the dinner for the first time this year, said the inclusiveness of the gathering made him feel more comfortable
“As I’m more gender fluid, sometimes, I’m uncomfortable in trans men’s groups, because that’s not really who I am,” he said.
People of all ages, races and backgrounds come to the dinner to share their trans experiences together. They can find inspiration in others going through the same things they are, Lofton said.
“To have leaders in the leaders in the community that are both elders and have done this for a long time, then the next generation coming in, and have one place where they can all mix together is really important to us,” he said.
Narcisse said the dinner is a rare and deeply needed celebration.
“It seems like a lot of the narratives are about our tragedies and our struggles,” she said of transgender representation in the media and society as a whole. “I think that sometimes, we have to be cautious of what message that sends to people — that you’re only important in death. We need to empower people while they’re here.”
Derek Gaffney, a gender-fluid transgender man said the Thanksgiving potluck is a place to simply exist without judgment.
“You don’t have to explain that you’re trans,” he said. “They all automatically know the struggles you’re going through, because they’re going through the same stuff.”
Jessica Zyrie, a case manager at the center, model, transgender woman and Miller’s girlfriend, said the dinner is a space filled with unconditional love shared between people who have chosen each other.
“Knowing that so many people are not affirmed and accepted for just living in their truth, I think coming in this space and seeing the love and people cooking and parts of their own traditions and being able to celebrate, I think is really powerful,” she said.
“This lets people say say, ‘Well, I may not have spent Thanksgiving with family — my biological family — but I was able to spend it with chosen family.”"

Rice class explores what it means to be Muslim in America
By Lindsay Peyton

On the first day of the “Muslims in America” class, Rice University instructor Craig Considine places students in the driver’s seat.
He tells them: “I’m giving you the keys to the car. I’ll be sitting in the passenger seat, but you’re going to go out there and do this.”
On their second meeting, Considine divides students into groups, each charged with finding an area of interest to explore throughout the semester. Each group also determines how they will showcase the results of their efforts in a final project.
“We’re not writing papers, and we’re not making Power Points,” Considine says. “You have to do something different.”
His focus is on self-directed, active learning. Students come up with their own questions and their own parameters.
Considine’s role is to offer advice and suggestions. “I’m here to guide you on your journey,” he tells his students.
Considine neither assigns readings nor leads lectures. Instead, he arranges a series of guest speakers to visit the class. He wants his students to gain knowledge directly from the source.
This semester, for instance, he invited Pastor Bob Roberts from NorthWood Church in Dallas, Imam Mustafa Carroll, director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations in Dallas, and Imam Mohammed Khan of the Maryam Islamic Center in Houston.
Team members and founders of IslamInSpanish, a Houston nonprofit that educates Latinos in the U.S. about Islam, spoke to the class, as well as Shahid Shafi, vice chairman of the Tarrant County Republican Party.
In addition, the class was visited by Steve Slocum, former Christian missionary and author of a “Why Do They Hate Us?” The book explores Islamaphobia in the U.S.
Misunderstandings involving Islam are what spurred Considine on this path. His own interest in the religion dates to 9/11 when he was 15-years old, living in the suburbs of Boston.
Raised as a Catholic, Considine had no knowledge of the Islamic faith, but he quickly became aware of the negative portrayal of Muslims in the media. He also realized the power that education had to clear up misconceptions and combat bias.
Considine says he sees the same lack of understanding of Islam today. As an instructor, he wants to have a role in reversing that.
“A lot of students go into class with hardly any knowledge of Islam and Muslim Americans,” he said. “I try to bridge the gap in their minds about what it means to be a Muslim and what it means to be American.”
And Considine wants to accomplish that goal in the most effective way possible. When students finish his class, he hopes that they will be better able to hold up an educated discourse on the subject, debunk conspiracy theories and challenge stereotypes.
“I try to empower them,” Considine said.
By placing students in control in the course, he wants to show them their own potential to make a positive impact.
“It’s not just learning what to think; it’s bigger than that,” Considine said. “They have to learn to create in a way that’s constructive and can build bridges in their communities.”
This semester, one team interviewed Muslims who identify themselves as Republicans, while another group explored negative portrayals of Muslims in the media.
Some students decided to explore Hindu and Muslim relations; others looked at how the physical space of a mosque displays Islamic values. One group learned about Muslims involved in civic engagement.
Noor Gamal Eldin, Emma Siegel, Eden Desta, Amanda Ochu and Alina Zhu formed a team to more deeply examine IslamInSpanish.
Sophomore Noor Gamal Eldin, a Muslim with parents who immigrated from Sudan, was interested in ways other minorities combined their identities as Muslims and Americans. She also wanted to learn more about the rising number of Latinos who are converting to Islam.
After conducting four interviews at IslaminSpanish, she gained a new perspective. “We were able to gain a better understanding of who they are as individuals, why they chose Islam and how Islam affected their lives,” she said.
Questions involved prior religious experiences and how converting affected them and their families.
The team members found that the subjects of their interviews benefited from their conversions, Gamal Eden said. They seemed to feel better equipped to search for peace in their lives.
Desta, a junior and a Catholic, admitted that her knowledge of Islam was limited prior to the class.
“It’s a topic I was relatively uneducated about,” she said. “The only thing I knew about Muslims or Islam was anything I heard in the media or in my social sphere. I wasn’t exposed to the actual experience of people who are Muslim.”
The project with IslaminSpanish taught her a lot, she said.
“I learned how similar Islam is to Christianity,” Desta said. “They’re both Abrahamic faiths. It helped me grow as a person — seeing our connections to other people.”
For Siegel, a junior, the course applied to her double major degree in history and sociology. She’s Jewish and is the co-president of Rice’s interfaith council.
“I saw similarities between Judaism and Islam,” she said. “Seeing that commonality was really important to me.”
Working in a group that came from all different backgrounds also was affirming to Siegel. “We all vibed really well,” she said. “I think that’s because of our differences, not in spite of them.”
Group member Zhu, a sophomore who is agnostic, also wanted to learn more about the Muslim Latinx community through the project.
“In the media, we have representations of the Latinx community and the Muslim community,” she said. “A lot of times, the media misconstrues both of these narratives.”
Through the group’s interviews, she learned about the backlash that individuals faced from their families and peers when they converted. “They had negative stereotypes in their own communities,” Zhu said. “They faced discrimination in that sense as well.”
Still, she found that the subjects they interviewed were inspired by what they found in Islam.
“Religion became a rock in their lives,” she said. “It was something they could derive passion from and find community in.”
Zhu wrote about her experience with the group in the Rice Thresher newspaper. “Even in our group of five, we can take steps in changing media relations for another community,” she said. “Our projects are making real contributions. I’m not just learning about things, but I can also make a difference.”
Considine has offered this class for his five years as lecturer at Rice University.
Past projects have culminated into fundraisers, dinner dialogues, web sites, blogs, documentaries and social media accounts.
Considine’s mission is that team members will carry a lasting impression of the research they did this semester and the projects they created.
Desta said she is confident that she will carry this experience forward in her career in public health.
“Being mindful of other people who don’t share the same backgrounds as me, it broadens my perspective,” she said. “People have more than one identity. They don’t have to fit in a singular category.”
Gamal Eldin plans to work further with IslaminSpanish. “Our professor fostered our intellectual curiosity, facilitated our learning and helped us make connections” she said.
Being in a classroom full of students interested in learning more about Islam made a lasting impression on her.
“Seeing students act as allies for other minority communities shows they care and these issues are important,” she said. “It’s easy to stay silent, to be among people who care about the issues and want to see change, that’s really powerful.
Considine encourages his students to be “cross-cultural navigators.” This is not something he sees as limited to the classroom or to Muslims in the U.S. There are a number of minorities who have been negatively stereotyped and deserve to be heard first-hand, Considine said.
“I’m just laying a foundation,” he said.
His studies of Islam have strengthened his own faith in general.
He pointed to a verse of the Quran that says humanity was formed purposefully into “nations and tribes so that you would recognize each other.” He explained the point of being different was to get to know and care for each other.
“That’s what Jesus was attempting to do as well,” Considine said. “He was trying to bring the most destitute members of society into the fold.”
Considine recently wrote a book entitled “Islam in America: Exploring the Issues,” and is at work on “The Dialogue of Civilizations: Muhammad’s Interactions with Christians.”
He also wrote “Muslims in America: Examining the Facts” and “Islam, Race, and Pluralism in the Pakistani Diaspora.”
He hopes to foster further exploration of Islam in his books and his classes. Interfaith dialogue is essential.
“It’s important now, but it will be even more important in the future,” Considine said. “Tensions can be lessened when we get to know each other. You have to go out and get to know each other, before there is any real understanding at any level.”"

Latino faculty face ‘gross’ pay disparities at UT Austin
By Olivia P. Tallet

Texas education leaders are discussing how to address the findings of a recent report that detailed “gross disparities” and “discrimination” in compensation, leadership opportunities and other measurements for Hispanic professors at the state’s flagship university.
The 188-page “Hispanic Equity Report,” released last fall by a group of eight professors at the University of Texas at Austin, found that UT faculty of Latino origin earn thousands of dollars less than their white peers at all levels of professorships. The gaps occur even “after taking account of field, rank and scholarship,” the report says.
“We found that Hispanics are grossly underpaid and underrepresented in positions of leadership in a university that makes diversity one of its central missions,” said Alberto Martínez, a history professor and chair of the Independent Equity Committee that produced the report.
Hispanic professors say they have long known about the inequalities and underrepresentation. The university’s Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, for example, has had 13 directors since its 1940 founding; none was of Hispanic or Latin American origin. The institute is named after a Hispanic alumna who endowed it with $15 million.
“That’s simply grotesque,” said Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, a UT history professor. “That’s like having a prestigious center of African American studies (that has) never had an African American director; it would be unthinkable.”
But, he added, “that’s where we are.”
UT officials recognize the problem but disagree on the scale of salary disparities.
Speaking at a recent Faculty Council meeting, Gregory Fenves, the president of UT Austin, said that a university council on racial and ethnic equity and diversity completed the first phase of a study on Latino faculty pay and found issues similar to those in the equity committee report.
“There were some differences especially in interpretations of data,” Fenves said, according to an official transcript of the meeting. “But there clearly are inequity issues.” He said the council would be “working through this information very, very diligently.”
Joey Williams, a spokesman for UT’s executive vice president and provost, stressed that the university is “strongly committed to further understanding this potential inequity and fixing it.”
Salary gaps
For the analysis, the committee used methodology similar to the Gender Equity Report of 2008 that prompted changes to address disparities between female and male scholars, according to the document.
“One of the most alarming discoveries is that the inequities grow and get larger the longer a Hispanic professor is at UT,” Martínez said.
The most significant compensation gaps in net terms were found among full professors, where Latinos were paid approximately $25,300 less on average than their Anglo peers in 2017, the focus year of the report. Assistant professors faced a gap of roughly $19,600 on average, and the difference was about $10,600 for associate professors.
The report analyzed data from different sources, including the Texas Tribune’s Government Salaries Explorer, which publishes payroll information from state public entities responding to open records requests.
Another major problem is that “Hispanic women are the most underpaid (professors) in the university in almost every category, and they are extremely underrepresented,” Martínez said.
Hispanic women who are full professors at UT were paid $37,100 less on average than white men with the same tenure status; $15,800 less than equivalent white women; and $10,200 less than men of Latino origin. The report found a similar pattern for assistant professors, where white men were paid 44 percent more than Latinas.
Williams, the spokesman for the provost, said the university’s analysis found “the difference (in compensation) is a little over 3 percent for full and associate professors favoring white faculty.” He said that in some job classifications, Latina professors even earn more than their white peers.
He said “that pattern is reversed with a much larger difference favoring our Latina over white assistant professors and not much of a difference at all when we compare salaries across races for assistant tenure track professors who are men.”
“Regardless, this difference favoring white over Latinx faculty at the senior ranks needs to be investigated further,” he said.
Defining the problem
Gloria González-López, a sociology professor at UT, said race and gender are also factors.
“I use the concept of ‘academic doméstica’ (domestic servant) to describe this, where Latina professors do a lot of services for which they are not paid or paid worse than anybody else” in academia, she said.
Part of the burden that faculty members of color have in majority-white educational institutions is a sense of responsibility to serve as mentors and role models, frequently helping disadvantaged students who are first-generation college students, González-López said.
“A basic tenet of education across the lines, whether you’re talking about kindergarten kids or college students, is that in order for students to learn, they need to feel connected to the classroom and the faculty, and they are more likely to feel that with someone who shares their background,” said Natasha Warikoo, a Harvard University professor and author of the new book “The Diversity Bargain: And Other Dilemmas of Race, Admissions, and Meritocracy at Elite Universities.”
The overwhelming majority of full-time professors at UT — 80 percent — are white. By contrast, only 7 percent are Hispanic even as students of Hispanic ethnic origin are 23 percent of the undergraduate population and 11 percent of graduate students.
At colleges and universities where there are more Latino students than faculty, such as at UT, “students are going to go disproportionately to those professors, who, in turn, are disproportionately asked to serve on committees,” Warikoo said. That’s in part because of the background and cultural knowledge that they bring to campuses.
Fenves has stressed that diversity and inclusion are priorities, according to his official bio. Under Fenves, the university successfully defended its admissions practices before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2016 Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin case, winning and consolidating the right to use race as a valid criterion in its so-called holistic admission policies.

University leaders say they want a more diverse faculty. “As we explore improving faculty equity issues, we also want to seek ways to improve the supply of future Hispanic professors through graduate opportunities,” said Williams, the UT spokesman.
Hispanic professors say they frequently hear the argument that there are not enough Latinos with graduate degrees to increase faculty representation.
“That’s a convenient, false argument for a university like UT,” Cañizares-Esguerra said. He contended that “this is the wealthiest institution (of higher education) in the country after Harvard, capable of attracting talented (Latino) professors from anywhere.”
The equity committee’s analysis also found that of the 130 deans, vice deans and associate and assistant deans at UT-Austin, only 7.7 percent are Latino; none is a Hispanic woman. The underrepresentation of Latinos is a pattern observed at all levels of leadership, endowments and recognition, according to the report.
“It’s ironic that in this state where almost 40 percent (of residents) are Latinos, we are having these inequalities at the public state university,” González-López said.
What comes next?
Among other remedial actions, the provost’s office has asked UT Austin deans to review how leadership and committee roles are assigned, Williams said. And Provost Maurie McInnis recently created a group of deans to pilot new approaches to address issues of salary equity, diverse faculty recruitment and retention, departmental governance and academic unit climate.
State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, said he’s contacted Fenves’ office and wants a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the equity report and disparities.
The report is “quite compelling, particularly the disparity in pay,” said Rodriguez, who is policy chair of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. “It seems that the University of Texas can do a much better job in incorporating more Latinos and Latinas, not only as professors but as deans and higher levels of academia.”
Martínez, the equity committee chair, said the group will continue pushing for changes at the university.
“I don’t think these are intentional biases that are executed by individuals who consciously dislike Hispanics,” he said. “But whether these patterns are intentional or not, the consequences are similar. We feel excluded because we are.”"

Why is there no major Latino cultural center in Houston?
By Molly Glentzer

By next fall, more than $700 million in building projects that have transformed Houston’s Museum District during the past decade will be complete. Near the Theater District, Stages’ new Gordy complex opens next weekend, further burnishing the city’s reputation as a cultural mecca.
But will Hispanic Houstonians see their culture represented in these new spaces consistently and profoundly?
Some community leaders think not, even though the city’s Latino population is 44.9 percent, a number that is expected to grow with the 2020 census.
Those leaders wonder why a city with such a fierce appetite for new parks, public spaces, museums and theaters has not invested in a major facility that acknowledges their significance. Why doesn’t Houston have a Latino cultural center on the scale of, say, the Asia Society Texas Center?
“Houston’s arts are ethnically and economically segregated,” said Nicolás Kanellos, a University of Houston professor and the founder/director of Arte Público Press, the nation’s top publisher of Hispanic literature. The city’s major arts supporters, including individuals and philanthropic foundations, “have put all of their money into cultural centers for the wealthy and marginalized Latino cultural arts,” he said.
A number of other cities with burgeoning Latino populations are either already supporting their culture with multi-disciplinary arts centers or planning new ones. Dallas, Austin and San Antonio have had multimillion-dollar Latino centers for years. California’s Riverside Art Museum will open its Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture & Industry next year, and there’s a campaign underway to build the Latino Cultural Arts Center in Denver.
The point isn’t just to erect another building. A well-funded center could help to equalize and elevate local Latino visual, performing and literary arts groups that have been perennially underfunded or little known in Houston.
Tony Diaz, founder of the 21-year-old literary organization Nuestro Palabra: Latino Writers Having Their Say, was among those alarmed in September when the long-struggling performing arts organization Talento Bilingue de Houston, a bilingual English-Spanish theater group, lost its nonprofit status and folded. He also felt the failure was inevitable.
“It’s appropriate that the Talento Bilingue building used to be a supermarket,” he said. “Basically, the community was given a building that wasn’t built for art and told to have at it. There’s never been enough money to run the place, so every administration that’s been there was set up for failure.”
The Talento Bilingue Center is owned by the city and managed by Houston First, a local government corporation that promotes the city and oversees more than 10 city-owned buildings and properties. The building holds a theater, large studios and community rooms — making it Houston’s most comparable facility to Latino cultural centers elsewhere.
The city tapped the legacy group, MECA, Multicultural Education and Counseling through the Arts, to operate the Talento Bilingue Center while it creates a long-term plan for the building. Continuing to operate the building it owns in the Sixth Ward, MECA will offer its first dance, music and art classes at the TBH Center starting Jan. 21.
“Things are still up in the air about exactly what the community wants,” said MECA founder Alice Valdez.
City Council Member Robert Gallegos admires Valdez’s work. The community needs both the MECA and TBH centers, he said, but he believes Houston also has room for something bigger and better. “As our population grows, we will need a larger facility,” he said.
He already has a vision for what that might be. Gallegos worked with Mayor Sylvester Turner last year to commit $1.5 million in future capital improvement funds toward buying land for a Hispanic library and archive building in 2024.
He would like to see that idea develop into a building with a theater and an art gallery as well as a library, calling it “a Hispanic cultural arts and archive center … a multi-service center for the arts that is also a tourist attraction.”
Financing such a place would require the full-philanthropic press of a major capital campaign. But what might be possible if Houston embraced the idea?
Albuquerque aims for national profile
The 20-acre campus of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque’s Barelas neighborhood is the gold standard.
Its five simpatico buildings contain a museum with three exhibition spaces and a collection of more than 3,000 objects; a three-theater performance hall; a library and genealogy center; an education building and two restaurants.
The architecture is on display, as well, designed by local firms to reflect the diverse history of Hispanic design. There are visual lessons in the powerful geometry of Mesoamerican pyramids, the curves of Spanish-inspired barrel-vaulted ceilings, the grace of Spanish-Pueblo Revival style and the drama of modern Latin minimalism.
The brainchild of local artists in the late 1970s who wanted space to show their work because mainstream institutions ignored them, the campus was ultimately built in 2000 by the state of New Mexico.
Construction begins this spring on a welcome center surrounding the chapel-like tower that holds artist Frederico Vigil’s monumental concave fresco “Mundos de Mestizaje,” a star attraction that depicts the history of pre-Hispanic and Hispanic civilization.
The National Hispanic Cultural Center sees about 280,000 visitors annually. About 70 percent are local, although acting executive director Alberto Cuessy and his staff would like to attract more out-of-towners.
“Like every arts and culture organization, we struggle for money,” Cuessy said. “We have 32 staff for 20 acres, five buildings, 700 events a year. It’s incredible what these people can do on a shoestring.”
The center operates on an annual budget of about $2.2 million, appropriated by the Legislature mainly for operations and staffing. The NHCC Foundation provides funds and support for its many programs through grant opportunities and sponsorships.
“We are always looking at our programs for ways to reach new audiences,” Cuessy said.
Tey Marianna Nunn, the NHCC museum’s director and chief curator, sees opportunities to grow. “Mainstream institutions are clamoring for Latino subject matter because they don’t have the expertise, and we do,” she said. “So there are ways to leverage. But I don’t think one center can do it all because there are so many differences and nuances, layers and complexities to Latino communities and culture.”
Serving the Dallas community
Dallas’ 16-year-old Latino Cultural Center is community-focused, home to two resident theater groups. It’s also used by several other Latino performing-arts organizations.
Designed by Mexican modernists Ricardo and Victor Legoretta, the 27,500-square-foot facility contains a distinctive and color-blocked L-shaped building around a plaza. Inside are a 300-seat theater, a community room and a gallery space.
One of four community centers overseen by Dallas’ Office of Arts & Culture, the LCC was financed with a mix of public and private funds and built for just shy of $10 million. General manager Benjamin Espino believes that without land and a lead gift of $250,000 donated by the Meadows Foundation — one of Dallas’ oldest private philanthropic organizations — the concept could have languished indefinitely.
The city recently found $4.8 million to expand the center, eliminating a public-private funding rule, so it could activate an improvement bond for the project that voters approved in 2003. Those funds will add a black-box theater.
Finding what Houston wants
Alice Valdez, MECA’s founder, gets angry when people say Houston has no Latino cultural center.
A former professional musician, she started Houston’s oldest and largest Latino cultural organization 42 years ago. MECA’s multi-story historic structure in the Sixth Ward — the former Dow School, built in 1912 — is nowhere near state-of-the art but will soon be upgraded.
The city awarded MECA $800,000 in Hurricane Harvey relief funds to repair roof damage and leaks. After a two-year private fundraising effort with major support from the Cullen Trust for the Performing Arts, the Brown Foundation and the government of Qatar, MECA also is replacing its makeshift theater with a new auditorium and installing elevators. Construction begins next summer and should be complete in 2021, Valdez said.
MECA presents art exhibits and performances but focuses on out-of-school programs and social services as a United Way agency.
When people talk about a Latino cultural center, they can mean many different things, said Debbie McNulty, director of the Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs. “Whatever is in your head right now, 10 people will have 10 different ideas.”
Arté Publico Press, University of Houston’s Center for Mexican-American Studies, the Hispanic Forum and the Mexican Institute of Greater Houston are all well-established and respected; they, too, could be considered cultural centers. So might the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston’s International Center for the Arts of the Americas. But none of them offer programs akin to the centers in Dallas and Albuquerque.
McNulty’s office is seeking public input about the future of the TBH Center. The East End Houston cultural district and the East End District TIRZ (Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone) also have a stake in the property, which is tantalizingly close to the convention center. Hispanic community leaders want it to remain in the hands of a Hispanic organization.
‘Hispanic cultural capital’
Houston has an abundance of what Diaz calls “Hispanic cultural capital.”
That was clear last spring when the University of Houston hosted the international Latino Art Now conference. The mayor declared it a spring of Latinx arts, and for several months virtually every arts institution in the city showcased Hispanic talent, much of it local.
“The stereotype is there’s not enough interest or talent. That’s not true,” Diaz said. “But there are a lot of structural barriers to Latino art institutions prospering.”
According to a study commissioned by the community and released in late 2018 by the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures, only 7 percent of Houston’s hotel-motel tax funds — the biggest local source of public funds for the arts — were awarded to Latino organizations from 2010-2015. Houston’s four largest philanthropic foundations scored even worse: Less than 1 percent of a total $110 million they gave to arts during that period went to Latinos.
Funds from Houston’s hotel-motel taxes are still skewed toward large institutions in the Museum and Theater Districts that attract tourists. In December, the city approved approximately $128 million of those funds, to be distributed by the Houston Arts Alliance through 2024. McNulty’s office and the arts alliance have recently improved the transparency and fairness of the grants processes, resulting in a dramatic increase of applications from all over the city, especially from individual artists — and more competition for the funds.
MECA typically receives the most of any Houston Latino organization — about $75,000 a year — which is less than one-tenth of its annual budget.
“Let’s put it in context,” Diaz said. “In San Antonio, two of the three highest-funded nonprofits are Latino: the Guadalupe Theater is getting $500,000 this year, and the Esperanza Center, which does hardcore community activism, is also in the six-figure range.”
Arte Público flourishes because the University of Houston gave it a home, said Kanellos, the founder of Arte Público. Through a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution, he is able to present literary programs and exhibits around the United States; but Arte Publico stopped working with its hometown schools after local funding for those programs was cut.
A dearth of Hispanic political power at City Hall and a lack of awareness don’t help, said Kanellos.
If a new Latino center were to materialize, it should be built in the Museum District, where it could be prominent and not a “poor stepchild,” he added. “It would be a phenomenon.”
McNulty noted that in Houston, such facilities typically arise through public-private partnerships driven by philanthropists who see a need, build consensus, raise a lot of money, put something in place and then donate it to the city, collaborating with government entities on sustainability and long-term operations. The parks renaissance of the past decade is a perfect example.
“There’s certainly a large number of Latinos in Houston, and a lot of Latino wealth,” she said. “If a group of Latino civic leaders and funders, high net-worth people, wanted to get together and say, ‘We need a cultural center,’ we’d have one. I think that’s the question: Is a certain amount of need being satisfied (already), or have people just not thought of this before?”
Diaz doubts that a new building will solve all of the inequities he sees, but he is optimistic about changes that more awareness will bring. “I think there’s a lot of goodwill. I think everyone wants to help,” he said. “We just haven’t looked at it this way.”"

Born for the role: Latinx stories show what it’s like to be a brown kid in this world [Gray Matters]
By Gerardo Velasquez

It’s hard not to feel selfish sometimes. But I was born for the role I got.
I still remember arguing with my mom in the kitchen. I was 17 and about to graduate high school. I was the first person in my entire family to ever have the option of going to college. I risked all that. A big part of me can’t believe I gave that security up. But a bigger part of me can’t believe I’m a working actor with an agent now. I can’t believe I can help my family pay bills.
My mom, an immigrant from Mexico, came to the U.S. at 17 all by herself, holding my older brother in her arms, fleeing from an abusive boyfriend.
My mom and I were living very different lives at 17.
She came to the U.S. to find her mother, who she hadn’t seen since she was a baby. She slept on the floor with my brother at her side. She told me she’d stay up all night, swatting roaches off of my brother until the sun came up and the light made them scatter. She’d sleep a few minutes, maybe an hour, and then head to work. While working at Whataburger, she met my dad, fell in love, got married and had three kids. Unfortunately, they didn’t stay together, and my mom was left to raise us on her own. I saw my dad here and there over the years, but he didn’t really hold a substantial place in my life.
It was impossible not to feel guilty when I told her I wanted to be an actor. I was the smart one of the family. I was always the one who fixed the Wi-Fi in our house. I took advanced placement classes, I took art classes and won awards, I ran track and cross country and won medals.
I fell into theater by accident. I was just waiting for a friend to finish auditioning for a school play so I could get a ride home, but I somehow got roped in and got a role in the stage adaptation of “Dracula.” That little performance changed my life. For the first time, I felt welcomed somewhere; I felt no judgment.
Ironically, in one of our school plays, I played a deadbeat father who was resented by all of his kids. That was the only performance my dad ever made it to. He cried at the end.
I did every play. I was obsessed. I stayed late every day helping paint and build the sets even though I didn’t have to. I quit art, cross country and track. My grades plummeted.
But I was happy.
When it came time to submit applications for colleges, I froze. I waited until all the deadlines had passed for most of the local schools and finally, minutes before the cutoff, I submitted an application for The American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Hollywood. At 11:50 p.m. I submitted my application electronically, along with a short video audition.
I got a shiny silver envelope in the mail saying I got in. I was terrified to tell my mother what I had done.
We shouted. She told me we couldn’t afford it. She worked in the cafeteria of an elementary school. We were barely scraping by. This was always the case, but when faced with what I wanted versus what made financial sense, I found every way around it.
She made sure to remind me that she came to this country to give us a better life, not for me to throw it away at an acting school.
She was right.
I only lasted a year in Hollywood. By the end, I was sleeping on a thin mattress pad on the concrete kitchen floor of a one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood. I was always hungry and I barely slept. No one knew how much I was suffering, I was too stubborn to admit it. I told everyone I was just going home for the summer. I came home to an empty room, furniture gone, walls painted white. My mom thought I’d be gone longer and was planning to rent the room. Over dinner, I told her I wasn’t going back to school. She stayed quiet and just nodded her head. I think she knew that Hollywood had broken me. I found work doing construction with someone my mom knew. I worked in the sun every day, tying rebar and pouring concrete.
That year, my mom brought us all into the kitchen and told us our dad was being deported. He was being held in a detention center in Eden, a small desert town about five hours west of Houston. We all piled in the car and drove out to see him one last time. It was Christmas Eve.
We walked through metal detectors and showed our IDs. My brother showed his military ID, and the guard thanked him for his service. We sat down in an open visitation room and the guards brought out a group of detainees in tan scrubs. A little girl broke away from her family, ran up to one of the men, wrapped her arms around his legs and yelled “papa!” The man began to weep. My dad came up and sat with us, giving us all a hug. He was skinny with less hair and a graying beard. My siblings and I updated him on what we were all doing. He told me to go back to school and study law or medicine; it was up to me to take care of the family. He told me to give up the whole acting thing. I asked him how to become a doctor if he knew so damn much, and my mother punched me.
The entire time I felt as if someone had cut me open. I was just trying to hold myself together, trying to keep my insides from falling out.
He had a point. I was the closest to having a shot at a viable career and I threw it away. It felt like our struggle was now my fault. I had the power to ease the financial burden and I chose to chase a pipe dream. I knew it was time to give up.
I kept working for the next few years, trying to figure out my life. I would work two, sometimes three jobs and did my best to help my mom with the bills. One day, I was mindlessly scrolling through Facebook, and I stopped on an ad for an audition notice for a feature film called “Rich Kids” that was set to film in Houston. I had never heard of anyone making a film in Houston, except for that one scene in “RoboCop.”
I clicked on the link and read the description. “A group of Latino kids break into Los Ricos, the local mansion, and pretend to be rich for a day in order to forget their difficult lives.”
I immediately sent them an email and begged for an opportunity to be a part of the project in any way. I told them I’d bring the coffee to set every day, I didn’t care. The director emailed me back and told me to send in a video of me reading a few of the scenes. I sent the video right away, and she called me a few days later and asked if I could do a video chat.
She offered me the lead role. I cried. I was in shock.
We shot the movie in 11 days in South Houston in the Pasadena area. It was the hardest, most demanding thing I’ve ever done. I was on set for 12 hours a day, sometimes more, sometimes overnight. The cast consisted of a group of young Latinos from all different backgrounds.
The story at its core is about a young Latino kid from a poor neighborhood who dreams of having more. How could I not relate? I gave it everything I had. For months, we held our breaths. The movie took over a year to finish editing, but it finally got done, and we premiered at the Houston Latino Film Festival in 2018.
Our director, Laura Somers, submitted to dozens of film festivals, every single one she could. We won Best Feature Film at HBO’s New York Latino Film Festival, Best Ensemble Cast at Downtown LA Film Festival, Best Ensemble Acting at Phoenix Film Festival, among many others. I won Best Actor at Reel East Texas Film Festival.
A few weeks ago, I found out that “Rich Kids” is going to be on Netflix this February.
I still can’t believe we’ve come this far. I can’t believe a stupid Facebook ad changed my life. I can’t believe this is just the beginning.
What I came to realize is that my origin story is not unique. This is the reality for a lot of young brown kids trying to do what makes them happy. We’re held back by economic hardship, by racism, by cultural stigma. We’re told that the future of our entire family is on our shoulders, and sometimes it’s true, but I believe it’s possible to do what you love and live a different reality than what our parents came here for, while still doing justice to the hardships they endured to get us here. They fought so that we could thrive, and we must break the boundaries of their imaginations. They deserve to see us do more than they could ever dream to do for themselves.
When I posted on social media about “Rich Kids” being on Netflix, I gained over 200 followers on Twitter within a matter of days. A great majority of them were young Latinos from Houston. They’re excited about this movie; they’re ready to support it in whatever way they can, and it’s not even out yet. This tells me that there is a huge demand to hear stories like this. People want to see movies like ours; movies that show the world what it’s like to be a young brown kid in this world.
We have to raise our own voices and tell our own stories because no one is going to do it for us. We have to encourage and support and nurture these voices or they will be buried.
We have to stop waiting for permission to tell our stories. We have to stop feeling selfish and guilty. I want young people to see this movie and realize that they are capable of doing exactly what they want to do.
Let’s get to work."

The great vision of Houston’s Arte Público Press
By Andrew Dansby


Just above Nicolás Kanellos’ desk in the Houston offices of Arte Público Press hangs a striking piece of black-and-white art – India ink on rice paper – that depicts a wake after the death of a child.
The numerous characters in “El velorio” are presented with exaggerated physical features and varied expressions of grief. The action in the piece looks a little like a William Hogarth woodcut from the 1700s. But Kanellos says artist Jorge Soto Sánchez – a New Yorker of Puerto_Rican descent who died in 1987 – looked not to Europe but rather to a 19th-century African artist for inspiration.
“I keep finding new stuff in it all the time,” Kanellos says.
Kanellos views literature similarly: He looks for stories rich with detail, written by Latino artists with a perspective unique to their experience. That’s what prompted him four decades ago to start Arte Público, which has published hundreds of books by scores of authors while also digitizing and offering publicly forgotten archival periodicals and other cultural documents. The press doesn’t routinely fling bestsellers into bookstores. But its dedication to preserving literature and culture has been remarkable in piecing together a written history that has been marginalized and left out of the mainstream publishing industry.
Its work is described as “vital and necessary” by Nicole A. Johnson, executive director of the organization We Need Diverse Books.
Novelist Daniel Peña says, “I think they’re doing the most important work in the world: They’re the only press that really acknowledges the human endeavor that is Mexican American literature.”
Arte Público occupies an office on the outskirts of the University of Houston campus. Inside the building nestled among warehouses, Soto Sánchez’s work isn’t an aberration but rather part of wall-to-wall décor – paintings, posters, woodcuts and also piles of bright books – that displays a broad history of the Americas.
Arte Público starts its 41st year resiliently ignoring trends defined by commerce. Instead, the publisher offers a platform to authors whose works don’t receive attention by the publishing epicenter in New York. Which means Arte Público quietly exists during what may become a defining flashpoint for diversity in books. Weeks into the new year, a combative debate caught fire about Latino representation and literature. Last week, author Jeanine Cummins’ book tour, including two Houston stops, was canceled after her potboiler about a woman and her son fleeing a drug cartel in Mexico, “American Dirt,” drew widespread praise and then scathing critiques for charges ranging from cultural appropriation to cultural miscues – there is no place for sour cream on street tacos.
Before that book’s reception transitioned from rapturous to negative, Kanellos treated “American Dirt” with a level-headed assessment. Rather than criticize it, he deflected attention to Peña’s 2018 novel “Bang!” – not just as an alternative to “American Dirt” for readers but as an alternative publishing experience.
Peña says his agent “wanted me to shape the book for the New York market. But I didn’t want it to become a thriller. I didn’t want a Disney fairy-tale situation.”
He fired his agent and sold the book – a story about the drug trade and American involvement in it – directly to Arte Público.
“It was the only press that would honor the vision of the book and take it on in its totality,” he says.
The restaurant in Jersey City, N.J., where Kanellos’ father worked shared a building with a bindery. Workers there would sometimes trade books for a meal. Kanellos remembers getting copies of books by John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway and Somerset Maugham. When he finally made his way to the public library, around age 10, the librarian asked about his reading preferences. He told her he liked Steinbeck. “She said, ‘No, no, too old for you.’ So she gave me a copy of ‘Black Beauty.'”
He laughs. “But I still have those old books,” he says. “They’re treasure.”
In 1973, he co-founded Revista Chicano-Riqueña, a quarterly publication out of Gary, Ind. Kanellos, then 28, says publishing was a natural activity that sprang from working with various marches and boycotts in the civil rights era.
In 1979, he pivoted toward book publishing. Arte Público’s name reflected its roots: It sprang from the idea of street art and other forms of creativity that were publicly shared.
Arte Público soon found a groove, publishing Sandra Cisneros’ “The House on Mango Street” in 1983. Victor Villaseñor’s “Rain of Gold” – Arte Público’s first hardcover – became a national bestseller nearly a decade later. At the time, the reception from the publishing industry remained chilly. Kanellos today shrugs and expresses bemusement at a decades-old Wall Street Journal story about the mediocrity of a new internationally flavored wave of fiction.
“It wasn’t so great, but they mentioned our books, and people went and looked for our books,” he says.
Kanellos has always looked for untold stories in the margins of the industry and culture. The slush pile – incoming manuscripts without representation by a literary agent – has long been a point of ridicule in book publishing. Arte Público still looks through each of the more than 2,000 submissions it receives annually for some flash of greatness. They publish 25 to 30 titles each year. One of those this year is “Wishbone,” a young-adult novel by Anna Garcia Schaper, set partially in Houston, her hometown. “That one came across the transom,” Kanellos says, a gem found by an editor in the flow of submissions.
The publisher has aggressively worked in the children’s market, both picture books and young-adult titles, many of which appear in formats that have both English and Spanish versions. Kanellos says the rationale isn’t complex: They hope today’s picture-book readers will be tomorrow’s novel readers.
“There has been an awakening to see different representation in books for kids,” says Johnson, of We Need Diverse Books. “You have kids looking for books with characters that look like them. But children that grow up with this more diverse reading portfolio in their back pocket right now grow up and go, ‘What? What happened? Why aren’t you giving me something else?'”
Arte Público, it should be noted, is not just a book publisher. Its dedication to preservation of Latino writing extends far beyond new writers looking to tell stories.
Mainstream book publishing operates as a business first, with its archival efforts largely driven by financial concerns. Large publishers keep the canon in print not for the sake of culture but because it sells. When shelf space becomes cost prohibitive, titles fall out of print.
But Kanellos early on dedicated a portion of his resources to documenting and preserving all storytelling traditions in Spanish-language nations. “Not just literature,” he says. “Cookbooks, correspondence, memoirs. A lot of this material hasn’t been saved or made available in the past. This isn’t Franklin or Thoreau.”
Arte Público’s recovery program digitizes and makes available texts that would otherwise be lost or buried in archives.
Kanellos says Arte Público has requested books from the Library of Congress and archives at Harvard and Yale universities. It will request books so rare only one or two copies existto be scanned and archived. “We get signed copies from the 18th century,” he says.
“This is something people don’t talk about a lot. What they call post-custodial work. But we’re doing the post-custodial work.”
As a phrase, “post-custodial” doesn’t have much shine to it – certainly not the ring of “bestseller” or “Oprah’s Book Club.” But it does present publishing as a cultural calling, rather than a book-selling gamble.
The issue with “American Dirt” is more complicated than its author receiving a large sum of money for a thriller. Sandra Cisneros was among those who praised it as “the great novel of las Americas.” But Huffington Posts’s David J. Schmidt pointed out similarities between a scene in the book and one in “By the Lake of Sleeping Children,” a reported book by Luis Alberto Urrea. Writers who feel they have a deeper cultural connection to the sort of story presented in “American Dirt” don’t feel they have the opportunity to tell those stories because the industry infrastructure doesn’t see them.
“I had a conversation with another writer, and we wondered how much of the Latino canon was dictated to us by people in New York,” Peña says. “We wondered, what is the shadow canon? What are we not reading because we’re not told to by people in New York? That’s the greatness of Arte Público, as a publisher and also its recovery project.”
Johnson says the Cooperative Children’s Book Center surveyed publishers and found far less than 10 percent of titles were written by Latinx writers.
“The cultural demographics are changing, and some publishers have adapted to that better than others,” she says. “But do you know who always got it right? Arte Público and a few other publishers who saw these trends that were coming, and they’ve seen it since the ’70s.”
So Kanellos and his staff – roughly a dozen – have tried to create a platform removed from cycles and trends, though some themes persistently endure.
On a back wall at Arte Público hangs another piece of art, this one by Malaquías Montoya. The image was used as the cover for “The Adventures of Don Chipote, or, When Parrots Breast-Feed,” a satire written by Daniel Venegas that Arte Público published in Spanish in 1998 and in English in 2000.
It represents what the publisher does so well because the book is one of its recovery stories. Venegas’ novel was originally published in 1928, telling the story of a struggling immigrant nearly a century ago in Los Angeles.
“It’s the kind of book that time would typically relegate to the margins,” Kanellos says. “But one of the things we can do is give writers a voice who can’t find another place to publish. And to bring these stories back from the margins.”"

Emilio Delgado talks about his journey from ‘Sesame Street’ to the Alley’s ‘Quixote Nuevo’
By Wei-Huan Chen

Emilio Delgado walks into the VIP room of the Alley Theatre with a wide smile on his face. As he shakes hands, he looks intently with the kind of warm expression that suggests the question, “How are you doing today?” When Delgado sits down and begins to speak – his voice gravelly and sonorous, his words precise and deliberate – he tells stories of growing up along the U.S.-Mexico border with a style that draws you in like a campfire tale.
It’s no surprise, of course, that Delgado embodies an inimitable combination of gravity and affability. When it comes to Latino actors on TV, he remains a giant. Working for 44 years as the charismatic business owner Luis on the television show “Sesame Street,” Delgado is perhaps the most important Mexican American actor to ever appear on a children’s program.
Now, he’s in Houston to star in “Quixote Nuevo,” at the Alley Theatre through Sunday. Written as an adaptation of “Don Quixote,” the play is the first-ever story on the Alley main stage to focus on Latino experience. Delgado is the titular protagonist as Jose Quijano, an aging man living in a city on the Texas-Mexico border. Told that he is headed to an assisted living facility, Quijano decides to escape his home and embark on a fantasy-filled quest.
It’s the perfect role for Delgado. Because “Quixote Nuevo” adapts Cervantes’ story for the Chicano experience, Delgado, who himself grew up on the border, fit naturally into the character.
“That’s an aspect of Chicano culture that’s in this play,” he says. “The play, 95 per-cent of it is in English, but there’s the cultural aspect of Mexican-ness, of Chicano-ness, that’s in there. There’s a way of speaking that pops in there. It’s peppered with words, phrases, exclamations in Spanish. It’s interesting that it has this aspect of Mexican American culture.”
And so, for the members of the production who shared that cultural identity, the characters made sense right away. “We hit the ground running with that ‘border mind,'” Delgado says.
Delgado was born in Calexico, Calif., but grew up in his grandparents’ house south of the border, in Mexicali, Mexico. As a schoolboy, he crossed the border on a daily basis. He spent his days speaking English, attending school in California and listening to rock ‘n’ roll. He spent his nights speaking Spanish, listening to mariachi and watching Mexican movies about “cowboys with horses and big hats, singing with their guitar,” he says.
“It’s an expansion of personality when you have both cultural contexts,” he says.
And it helped his career as an actor. At a time when opportunities were few and far between for Latinos, Delgado could nab voiceover jobs.
“I could do voiceover material without an accent. I could do different accents in English as well as different accents in Spanish,” he says. “It expanded my opportunities.”
But he remained keenly aware that Latinos either were invisible in TV and film or were portrayed as criminals and lowlifes.
“I’d been trying all my professional life to be somewhere I can change that, whether I was talking about it or trying to get into a project that showed Latinos in a good light,” he says. “That’s why ‘Sesame Street’ was such a good thing. For the first time on television, they showed Latinos as real human beings.”
“We weren’t dope addicts. We weren’t maids or prostitutes, which were the way we were being shown in television in film,” he continues. “Here, on ‘Sesame Street,’ there were different people who spoke different languages and ate interesting foods, and they were all Americans.”
The role of Luis, as a recurring character on “Sesame Street,” meant Delgado landed one of the pioneering jobs in the history of Latino representation in American TV. But Delgado says much progress still needs to be made.
“What needs to happen is Latinos have to move into the power structure of Hollywood, which we haven’t quite done yet,” he says. “There’s hope, definitely. I’m working with this young cast – such incredibly talented performers and actors. There’s an amazing amount of Latinx talent.”
After all, Delgado says he’s often approached by Latinos who thank him for his role as Luis – viewers who had never seen Latinos portrayed as complex human beings on TV. Delgado’s starring role in the Alley’s “Quixote Nuevo” is another step in the right direction, he says.
“It’s culturally oriented to being Mexican American. There’s a personal significance,” he says. “It’s a fabulous thing. And it’s not only for Latinos and Latinas. It’s about people and family and finding your way and falling in love. It’s for the whole world.”"

Piñata-inspired works at Art League Houston are not for bashing
By Molly Glentzer

Nothing to knock around lightly, the paper piñata has a complex history.
It may have originated in China, then found its way in about the14th century to Europe, where it was incorporated into Lenten traditions. Spanish missionaries took piñatas to Latin America in the 16th century, but indigenous people had a similar practice involving treasure-filled clay pots.
That legacy — and the meaningfulness of piñata-making in the Latinx collective conscious — drives the work of the three artists featured in Art League Houston’s show “Piñatasthetic.” Their materials are humble by nature — strips of colorful paper that they layer and build into sculpture and murals.
Josué Ramírez of the Rio Grande Valley pushes the working-class craft of piñatería into the contemporary art realm the most compellingly with his abstract psychedelic forms and a videotaped performance. In the video, he performs alongside a river bed, maybe the Rio Grande, in a costume that calls to mind a Nick Cave Soundsuit. But the the form of Ramirez’s piñata suit morphs continuously as the person inside it rolls and whirls. It could be so many things: A wild beast, a flower, a colorfully unsettled spirit. It’s mesmerizing.
His big, globular and wormy sculptures — also part of his “Pinatabstract” series — are fixed in place but have such a sense of movement you half expect them to wake up and animate the room.
Justin Favela, a Las Vegas-based artist who showed his Tex-Mex food-inspired sculpture last year at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft, has created a monumental mural based on Mexican painter José Maria Velasco’s late 19th century masterpiece “El valle de México desde el Molino del Rey.” Velasco’s original landscape, a realistic and tranquil depiction of a valley below snow-capped mountains, has a muted palette. Favela’s mural renders the in near day-glow colors, and the rows of paper strips create an almost Impressionistic effect. The image is readable only from a distance, nicely evoking the haze of time.
Dallas native Giovanni Valderas has built what looks like a rolling piñata with “Victory Lap,” a paleta cart-inspired sculpture emblazoned with the word Recuerda (Remember). It made me recall Sancho Panza’s fanciful cart in the Alley Theater’s wonderful recent production of “Quixote Nuevo.”
Valderas’ smaller, wall-dependent mixed-media pieces combine piñata materials atop nestlike deconstructions. For example, he spells out “Apaciguate” (“cool it” or “settle down”) with piñata paper strips atop layered slivers of wood, duct tape and newsprint.
Valderas explains in his artist statement that such works address the “tattered relationship” of his Guatemalan, Mexican and American ancestry. These are the show’s least piñataesque pieces, but that idea aptly expresses the soul of it all.
“Piñatasthetic” is up through Feb. 29 at Art League Houston, 1953 Montrose; free; 713-523-9530, artleaguehouston.org."

LNG opponents sue feds over two Port of Brownsville permits
By Sergio Chapa

Opponents of the liquefied natural gas industry have sued a federal agency that issued permits for a controversial LNG export terminal at the Port of Brownsville and a related pipeline.
In a petition filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the Sierra Club, the City of Port Isabel and four other opponents are asking a federal judge to review and overturn permits issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for Rio Grande LNG and the Rio Bravo Pipeline.
No court hearing has been set in the lawsuit.  FERC officials issued a permit for the controversial projects in November and then denied a request by opponents to reconsider the agency's decision.
Citing safety and environmental concerns, opponents of the projects say that Rio Grande LNG will become the largest polluter in the Rio Grande Valley, an impoverished region along the U.S./Mexico border.
""FERC has consistently ignored concerns about how Rio Grande LNG and other fracked gas facilities would harm already-marginalized Latinx communities in the Rio Grande Valley,"" Sierra Club organizer Rebekah Hinojosa said in a statement. ""This fracked gas export facility would devastate our local economy and subject our families to dangerous pollution, and it's unacceptable that FERC has refused to take these threats into consideration.""
However, supporters of the projects say they will reduce flaring in the Permian Basin of West Texas by creating a market for natural gas that would otherwise be burned off. Designed to export 27 million metric tons of LNG per year, the plant and pipeline will also bring billions of dollars of private investment to the impoverished region, generate thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of high-paying permanent jobs.
Rio Grande LNG is owned by Houston liquefied natural gas company NextDecade. Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge has entered a deal to buy the Rio Bravo Pipeline from NextDecade."

MFAH unveils new Latin art resources
Molly Glentzer

If you’re missing visits to museums and love Latin American art, this could keep you busy well past the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. If you’re a scholar, it could inform a lifetime of study.
The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and its research institute, the International Center for the Arts of the Americas (ICAA), have launched an expanded, redesigned website and database for its Documents of Latin American and Latino Art Digital Archive Project.
Begun 20 years ago, the project now offers full, free access to more than 8,200 letters, manifestos, newspaper and journal articles, exhibition reviews and other key theoretical, critical and art-historical texts. The materials include significant writings by artists, critics and curators from Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and the U.S. Latino communities — many now available for the first time, via a more user friendly platform.
The only digital humanities initiative of its kind, the site is fully bilingual for English and Spanish-speaking students, scholars, researchers, collectors and art enthusiasts.
""It is difficult to overstate the significance of this project to the fields of Latin American and Latino art,"" said MFAH director Gary Tinterow. ""Twenty years ago, then-MFAH director Peter Marzio and Mari Carmen Ramírez recognized that the lack of access to primary sources was a fundamental barrier to understanding entire generations of artists who made important contributions to 20th- and now 21st-century art.”
Ramírez, the institute’s founding director, is better known to the public as the museum’s curator of Latin American art. The major exhibitions she has organized have brought wider recognition to many masters of modern and contemporary Latin American art, including Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jésus Rafael Soto, Gego and most recently, Beatriz Gonzalez. During her watch, the MFAH also has amassed a superb collection of more than 2,000 works by Latin American artists.
The institute’s work is less tangible but no less important to scholars. It has now shifted its focus toward partnerships with artist’s archives and estates, foundations, and select public and private institutions, Ramírez said. “This new phase of the Documents Project will develop and expand a host of understudied areas of research, including Latin American contemporary artistic production; the work of Latin American and Latina artists; and a significant expansion of represented Latinx artists, both historical and contemporary.""
The archived material brings to life a ferment of international cultures, ideas and personalities, providing evidence of how artists, writers and intellectuals sought to define or challenge notions of a national art; how art movements emerged in response to changing local political situations and the encroachment of perceived North American imperial politics and culture; and how Latin American and Latinx artists contributed major theoretical insights to the early stages of global avant-garde movements and initiated novel tendencies.
Since its inception in 2002, the project has been accessed by more than 38,000 registered users and more than two million one-time global visitors."

As hate crimes against Asian Americans spike, coronavirus anything but an equalizer [Opinion]
By Amy Mu

A few weeks ago, in a now-deleted Instagram post, Madonna shared her thoughts about the new coronavirus. Sitting in a petal-filled bathtub listening to soft piano music, she stated, “it doesn’t care how rich you are, how famous you are…what’s terrible about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways — and what’s wonderful about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways.” New York’s Governor Cuomo echoed a similar sentiment, describing the pandemic as an equalizer.
There’s a certain irony to calling COVID-19 “the great equalizer.” Epidemics have long extracted bigoted rhetoric and folded it into the public eye. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans have spiked. A video shared on Twitter showed an Asian woman, wearing a face mask, being attacked in a New York subway station. In Midland, two Asian children and their father were stabbed in a grocery store. The instigator suggested that he had been trying to prevent them from spreading disease. Though COVID-19 can infect anyone, media outlets, social media users and elected officials have effectively racialized the virus as Asian.
Health discourse often serves as a conduit for discrimination. Historian Joan Trauner refers to this phenomenon as “medical scapegoating,” describing public health responses in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1900, an outbreak of bubonic plague struck San Francisco. Public health inspectors identified Chinatown residents collectively as culpable patient zero. Municipal reports described Chinatown as a “laboratory of infection,” “distilling its deadly poison,” “contaminat[ing] the atmosphere of … a populous, wealthy, and intelligent community.” The American Federation of Labor (AFL), meanwhile, stated that “the almond-eyed Mongolian is watching for his opportunity…to assassinate [children]…with one of his many maladies.” Years prior, the AFL and other nativist groups had cited purported filth and illness as a crucial justification for the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.
Racializing illness is not limited to Asian Americans. When H1N1 cases were confirmed in the United States in 2009, Latinx and Hispanic immigrants, especially those of Mexican heritage, were similarly scapegoated. Hosting a segment on H1N1 prevention on his talk show, Michael Savage warned his audience, “No contact anywhere with an illegal alien!”. On Alex Jones’ website, an anonymous user wrote that “MEXICANS ARE PIGS,” a convenient association to H1N1’s mainstream, colloquial nickname “swine flu.”
Similarly, before being identified in the United States, Ebola was all but invisible from mainstream American health discourse, as well as the budgeting priorities of the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. People afforded little to no sympathy or concern for Ebola and Ebola patients when they believed they couldn’t be among them. When American panic over Ebola peaked in 2014, media outlets portrayed it as inherently African and inherently foreign. Dinesh D’Souza called it “Obola,” likening Ebola to then-president Barack Obama — who’s continuously faced a slew of suspicions and criticisms for his own allegedly foreign background. The first Ebola patient in the United States was of Liberian descent, hospitalized in Dallas; African immigrants across Dallas reported experiencing greater suspicion and facing backlash.
Assigning the burden of a disease to marginalized communities is nothing new and it’s certainly not reserved solely for racial prejudice. The New York Times described AIDS as “Gay-related Immune Deficiency” when cases were confirmed in the U.S. Conversationally, people also used the terms “gay cancer” and “gay plague.” LGBTQ+ men were banned from donating blood due to assumptions that they likely carried HIV or AIDS. The FDA recently alleviated some of these restrictions, allowing men who have sex with men to donate blood given that they had had no sexual contact within at least the last three months. No such restriction exists for heterosexual blood donors. Blood donations are crucial in light of COVID-19; researchers have found promisingly high levels of antibodies in the plasma of COVID-19 survivors, but, as with many other points within the U.S. health system now, there’s a tremendous shortage.
When we examine our past and present alike, it’s truly difficult to suggest that COVID-19 or any widespread disease is an “equalizer,” especially when they have served as mediums to express bigotry. Likening marginalized communities to illness enables the reconfiguration of prejudice into a form of supposedly justifiable hypochondria. Furthermore, with both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, there are clear, devastatingly disparate outcomes. COVID-19 cannot be considered as an equalizer when its mortality rates are disproportionately higher among black Americans. It is, in fact, one of many epidemics that have ultimately underscored the inequalities built into the social and institutional fabrics of the United States."

Opinion: Remove the statue of Confederate General and Texas Ranger Lawrence Sullivan Ross at Texas A&M
By Sonia Hernández, Nancy Plankey-Videla, Sarah McNamara, Michael Collins and Felipe Hinojosa

Tradition defines Texas A&M University. In theory, there is nothing wrong with this principle. But what happens when institutional traditions symbolize white supremacy?
We, faculty of Latinx and Mexican American studies, Africana studies and Multicultural Education, join our students and colleagues in their call to remove the statue of Texas Ranger and Confederate Gen. Lawrence Sullivan Ross at Texas A&M University, College Station. The statue of Ross commemorates a man whose life, beliefs, actions and principles stand in stark contrast to the institution that Texas A&M University strives to be.
When Texas seceded from the Union in 1861, the state’s Declaration of Causes stated that the preservation of slavery, the subjugation of African Americans and the supremacy of white Texans motivated this call to arms. Ross saw these principles as upstanding and led Texas and the Confederacy in its fight to uphold “equal civil rights for all white men” and maintain “the servitude of the African race.”
Ross served in the Texas Rangers as a captain. The relatively unregulated purview of the Rangers led to anti-black, anti-Mexican and anti-native violence throughout the state. Archival research from scholars such as Monica Muñoz Martínez and William Carrigan illustrates that the Rangers did more than instill order; they instilled terror.
The Texas Rangers claimed land for white Texans at the cost of human lives they believed mattered less than their own. Ross, who was known as an “Indian fighter,” ordered the murder of native peoples who sought to escape Ranger raids on their sovereign lands. And, in 1901, the San Antonio Daily Express reported that Ranger presence in the city made “Mexicans live in terror and fear,” as Rangers harassed, abused and lynched Tejanos who lived in the region for generations. Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, the Rangers did not need hoods because the violence they committed was done with the endorsement and protection of the state. Between 1910 and 1920, the Rangers followed direct orders from the governor and killed several hundred Mexican-origin Texans. Scholars, across the state and nation, have gone to great lengths to document this history through the Refusing to Forget project.
In 1919, at the height of Ranger-led violence, Texas A&M University erected a statue to Ross. Our call to remove the statue is not an effort to remake history in exchange for politically correct fiction, but a call to recognize what the statue intended to represent in its historical moment. Jim Grossman, former president of the American Historical Association, reminds us monuments and statues do not explain history; the act of creating a statue carries a political purpose and agenda. When that statue represents a hateful past, it falls upon the university community to correct it.
It is impossible to divorce who Ross was, and what he stood for, from the statue itself. Ross grew Texas A&M University during his term as president at a time when higher education was segregated and intended to benefit white men only. The legacy of unequal treatment and discrimination lives on at Texas A&M and is validated by the veneration of men like Ross."

Fresh Arts in Houston focuses on diversity and equity
By Ryan Nickerson

When artists and creative entrepreneurs attended Fresh Arts events before the onset of COVID-19, they saw a diverse representation of people that fostered an inclusive environment — a valuable resource for artists of color.
But because of the pandemic, the arts nonprofit made a point to continue their emphasis on diversity through virtual content by highlighting artists of color in online workshops and discussions.
“They will always be mindful that this person is from the African American community, this person is from Africa, this person is Asian America, this person is Hispanic American,” said local theater artist Neisha Bently. “I think if you’re trying to report the image of inclusivity you would host your events in that manner.”
Fresh Arts is a nonprofit that helps local artists and creative entrepreneurs succeed in the business of art. Fresh Arts treats the arts as any other industry, understanding financial success comes from a strong business acumen. Through their artist-centered community programs, they offer resource sharing and skill-building initiatives to help advance their careers.
Immediately responding to news that Houston would be following work-from-home guidelines, on March 17 Fresh Arts launched the first of many virtual programs aimed at amplifying efforts and support of Houston’s creative community.
“We have reached nearly 30,000 users from all parts of the world,” said Marci Dallas, executive director of Fresh Arts in a news release. “We are reaching twice as many artists and arts lead organizations as we were offline. We’re able to do that even more effectively now by meeting them where they are.”
Fresh Art’s strategy was to leverage what they’re good at, which was nurturing a good online following, and talk to people who already want to talk to them, then work based on that, according to Fresh Art’s programs outreach coordinator Reyes Ramirez.
Every Tuesday, Fresh Arts launches Arts on Tap LIVE on Instagram TV, featuring artist interviews and behind the scenes scoops on local art happenings. On the first and third Tuesday of the month, audiences can participate in the Resource Round-up, hosted by Ramirez, on Facebook Live that featured special guests and informs viewers on available resources and upcoming opportunities. Fresh Arts also recently launched a Facebook Live Conversation Series that is broadcasted every Thursday, where local artists talk about how they are adapting and staying engaged during the pandemic.
Beginning in August, Fresh Arts will also launch a monthly podcast discussion on career development.
Online content provides artists with an opportunity to remain engaged with their audiences throughout the shutdown, such as mezzo-soprano opera singer Jessica Blau whose work, Sonquete Iberoamericanx, was rescheduled due to COVID-19.
“The fact that Fresh Arts is there to help support some of us artists who are trying to create our own work and really showcase different kinds of projects, it really helps individual artists,” said Blau.
Still, many Houston creatives are not aware of Fresh Arts, including many artists of color. According to Bentley, many African American artists she knows do not affiliate with what they consider “non-black organizations.”
“Working in the theatre community, there’s the Ensemble Theatre community, then there’s everyone else,” said Bentley, referencing Houston’s Ensemble Theatre, an African American ran theatre company which works to bring Black Theatre to the Houston community.
In Bentley’s conversations with African American artists, many will say, “’Oh, I thought it was just for white people’, and I’ve found myself having to explain that it’s really open to all of us.”
According to Ramirez, Fresh Arts understands that Houston is one of the most diverse cities in America and makes a point to feature artists of color in their discussions and programs.
“Even before the protests, we understood that artists of color make Houston what it is. It makes the Houston arts community what it is. It’s always been great, and we know by featuring them would be paying them respect but also shows Houston that this is it, this is the heart of it,” said Ramirez. “It’s artists of color who have made Houston’s arts community great.”
One of their recent conversation series featured local artists Marissa Castillo from Teartx, a local Latinx Theatre Company, and Matt Manalo from Filipinx Artists, an artist collective of Flipinx visual, performing, literary, culinary and multidisciplinary Houston artists.
They have also featured multidisciplinary artist, curator, and project manager Theresa Escobedo, and visual artists Jamie Robertson. Their July programming is centered around cultivating equity in the arts, with topics such as Amplifying Arts Writers of Color, Implementing Language Justice for the Arts, and Prioritizing Programming for Marginalized Artists.
“They definitely do garner attention from all different types of people, ethnic backgrounds, geographic locations, and also artistic disciplines,” said visual artist Amy Malkan. “We’re bringing a different flavor, we’re bringing our own cultural backgrounds, our perspectives, to whatever that artistic opportunity is. “We’re introducing people to new cultures, new ways of thinking, new ways of seeing things.”
According to Malkan, the arts is like any other industry where people have subconscious biases and give art projects primarily to people that are white, leading to artists of color missing out on opportunities.
By Fresh Arts producing content that featuring a diverse group of people, “you can’t say ‘oh well they’re only catering to this group’”, said Bentley. “It’s never all one color”.
“It’s important now for our voices just to be heard,” said performing artist Chris Thomas, also known as Yung Chris, “It’s always been the time for that but I feel like now is more critical just because of the climate of what’s happening around the world and in our community.”
“I think people are starting to listen now versus just being silent,” said Thomas. “We have a story as well. We have narratives as well. Those narratives and stories should be highlighted, and I hope it’s not just a trend but more so it’s an actual change that will continue in the far future.”"

Kristof: Now is a time to learn from Hispanic Americans
By Nicholas Kristof

Scholars call it the “Hispanic Paradox”: Despite poverty and discrimination, Hispanic Americans live significantly longer than white or black Americans.
Latinos also appear to have lower suicide rates than white people, are less likely to drink alcohol, are less likely to die from drug overdoses and, at least among immigrants, appear to commit fewer crimes.
Researchers have puzzled for decades about why this is. Strong families? Supportive social networks? Religious faith and active churches? A hard-driving immigrant work ethic?
It’s a paradox because the disadvantaged normally live shorter lives. Hispanics in the United States endure discrimination, high poverty, lower rates of health insurance than both white and black people — yet they enjoy a life expectancy of 81.8 years, compared with 78.5 years for whites and 74.9 years for black people.
This resiliency is now tested by the coronavirus, which has hit Latinos particularly hard: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this month that 33 percent of Americans testing positive for the coronavirus have been Hispanic, almost twice their 18 percent share of the population.
I came here to Cornelius, a town west of Portland, Ore., with a large Latino population, to gauge the impact of the crisis, and the virus predictably has struck Hispanics hard. Many are immigrants living in the country without legal permission and thus aren’t receiving federal relief payments. Yet what struck me, in keeping with the Hispanic Paradox, was how the community pulled together to ease the suffering.
Francis, 50, who does not want to be identified by her full name because she is living in the country without legal permission, lost her job as a receptionist because of COVID-19, but her 30-year-old daughter and her son-in-law took her in. “They may think it’s weird to have their mother-in-law living with them, but they’re not saying anything,” she said.
Meanwhile, Francis is volunteering for the community, driving boxes of food from a Catholic church to needy families. “My car overheats,” she said. “But I make it work.”
A Brookings Institution study found that since the start of the pandemic, 1 in 6 households in the United States has young children who aren’t getting enough food, so I asked Francis about hunger. She acknowledged that there must be hungry children but added, “If people knew kids were hungry, they would help. The community would step up.”
On the other end of the United States, Latinos in New York City display a similar resilience. Dr. Carmen Isasi, an epidemiologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who has studied Latinx populations, said that lately she has seen signs on Spanish-speaking churches offering food for the needy.
Scholars have been debating the Hispanic Paradox at least since 1974, when researchers found that the neonatal mortality rate in Texas was lower for people with Spanish surnames than with English surnames.
Researchers have found another paradox within the paradox: First-generation Latino immigrants tend to live longest, and their children — while better educated and earning more money — die earlier. Moreover, Latinos embedded in ethnic enclaves seem to do better than those who live in heterogeneous neighborhoods.
Part of the explanation may be that what many white Americans think of as “traditional American values” — an emphasis on faith, family and community ties — are disproportionately found among Latino immigrants but then fade as their children assimilate.
“If we find that someone needs help, we help them,” Raúl González Hernández, who works in a plant nursery and has just recovered from COVID-19, told me. He said that others had helped him when he arrived from Michoacán state in Mexico, so he wants to pay it forward — particularly if the person needing help is also from Michoacán.
I’ve been long interested in the Hispanic Paradox because I grew up in a mostly white farm town in Oregon that has been devastated by lost jobs. As I’ve written, one-quarter of the kids on my old school bus are dead from drugs, alcohol, suicide and other “deaths of despair.”
Latino families in the area have seemed more resilient because of their greater “social capital” — bonds of family, home region or church. Instead of being “criminals, drug dealers, rapists,” as Donald Trump alleged of Mexican immigrants in 2015, Latino immigrants often seem to be models of civil society.
“Our community, we rely heavily on each other,” Petrona Dominguez-Francisco, who works with a program called Adelante Mujeres that empowers women, told me.
Mark Hugo Lopez, director of global migration and demography research at the Pew Research Center, emphasized family ties as part of the basis for the paradox. “There’s a lot of support in my own family for those who are facing challenges, such as those who lost their jobs,” he said. “That’s how Latinos help each other.”
Another element may be faith and church connections. There’s some evidence that religious beliefs reduce behaviors like drug and alcohol abuse, risky sexual activity, violence and suicide, and a Harvard study found that church attendance or daily prayer or meditation correlates to better health and greater life satisfaction. Churches also offer a web of services and social connections that can buffer hardship.
Family and community ties also protect from a pandemic of loneliness in Western countries. One scholar has found that social isolation is more damaging to health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
This social fabric also isn’t a perfect shield from a pandemic. But it helps, and perhaps there’s a lesson in that for all the rest of us."

Virus strikes disproportionate blow in Beaumont Latino community
By Kaitlin Bain

Latinos who live in Beaumont and northern Jefferson County account for 13% of the population but nearly 30% of COVID-19 cases there, prompting urgent new outreach from public health officials.
Countywide, the growth rate of confirmed infections in the Latino community has outpaced that of nearly every other racial or ethnic group since mid-May.
The Beaumont Public Health Department has begun to respond. It has increased virus testing in locations well-known to the greater Latino community, translating informational materials into Spanish and getting the word out through local Spanish-language media, Director Sherry Ulmer said.
These strategies likely will help, but one regional health expert says the rate of the virus’ spread within the Latino community is indicative of long-standing barriers to overall health.
Shannon Guillot-Wright is director of Health Policy Research for the Center for Violence Prevention at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, which is researching how these traditional barriers have affected the virus’ spread in communities of color.
“Thinking about the neighborhoods people live in, where people work, where they go to school, the different kinds of food they have access to and how that all ends up affecting people’s health - those happened long before the pandemic,” she said.
“Now, we’re really seeing the dramatic impacts through COVID and what that means for long-term health and safety across age groups.”
Ulmer, whose department covers the northern half of Jefferson County, compared the Latino outbreak to that among African-Americans, who have experienced a disproportionate level and severity of coronavirus cases.
It’s likely the additional risk factors in the Black community were a greater focus when the pandemic began because the number of cases was higher.
Now, as the number of Black individuals testing positive for coronavirus inches closer to percentage of their overall population, the rise in the number of infected Latinos stands in stark contrast.
Since mid-May, Jefferson County’s Latino community has seen confirmed cases grow by nearly 715%. That’s compared to overall case growth of 526%.
One factor contributing to that is a language barrier, said Jesus Abrego, director of Hispanic Ministry for the Catholic Diocese of Beaumont.
Much of the Latino community in Southeast Texas speaks Spanish only, he said, yet information about the virus presented in Spanish to this point has been limited.
Abrego is working with the Health Department to do virus outreach through Spanish-language media.
Additionally, Ulmer said, Latino individuals are more likely to live in multigenerational households. As the economy has reopened and the average age of coronavirus patients has dropped, the younger members of those households have picked up the virus while working or socializing and brought it back to their families.
“Again, looking at an already vulnerable population, they are likely going to be hit the hardest,” Guillot-Wright said. “Especially when you put on top of that, essential workers in low-wage jobs are disproportionately people of color.”
That’s one reason it’s been so important to find ways to increase testing opportunities specifically in the Latino community. That way, those cases can be identified, and the infected individuals isolated sooner.
Late last month, the state tested more than 400 people at El Cristo Rey Catholic Church, which Ulmer said was specifically chosen for the Latino community.
Guillot-Wright said the channels and messaging being set up to address coronavirus also could make way to address many of the systemic barriers to health care going forward.
She specifically pointed to the focus on wearing masks for the broader community, instead of just to protect oneself as an example.
“For instance, when we talk about Latinx workers who are essential workers on the front lines and have a lot of contact with people, we don’t want to put (all of) the onus on those workers to wear a mask and practice hygiene,” she said. “It really takes the patrons as well. We’re also practicing safe hygiene to keep our community safe.”"

'Mucho Mucho Amor' is what beloved astrologer Walter Mercado left to a generation of fans
By Sonia Ramirez

A generation of Latinos, myself included, will remember Walter Mercado as in influential source of hope.
The flamboyant and larger than life Puerto_Rican boricua astrologer is the subject of a new Netflix documentary, now streaming, detailing the life of an extraordinary man who was a fixture, especially among Latinos, for his on-point predictions and his eccentric wardrobe.
""Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado"" delves into the life of this beloved television personality who came into your home through his multinational TV show, first seen on Telemundo and later on Univision.
""His broadcasts reached an estimated 120 million Latino viewers daily for more than three decades,"" NPR reported. 
In my household, my mother swore by him, and if you walked in while he was on, you better be quiet, sit down, and wait until he read all the horoscopes, and after, you had to be ready to discuss what he had just predicted so that your week would go better.
A definite fixture in my mind throughout my childhood, even years after I stopped watching the show.
From Cristina Saralegui to Oprah to Kelly Ripa, everyone knew Walter Mercado, and even if you didn't believe his visions into the future, you knew him for the outrageous capes he wore.
Even Lin-Manuel Miranda shared in an Oprah Magazine article how important Mercado was: ok“There was really nothing like it on [Spanish-language] television,” Miranda said in the documentary, recalling how his grandmother would shout, “Shut up! Walter Mercado is on!”
Mercado passed away at the age of 87 in November 2019, but not before being able to take part in his own documentary created by ""a trio of Latinx storytellers — co-directors Cristina Costantini and Kareem Tabsch, and producer Alex Fumero,"" according to the LA Times. 
The documentary explores ""the man behind the glamorous makeup and opulent wardrobe, as well as the unfortunate reason he vanished from the spotlight in 2006, at the peak of his career,"" said The Oprah Magazine. 
An icon to the Latino community, Mercado resonated with generations of adoring fans who saw him as a symbol of hope and faith in the world.
Mercado's beloved catchphrase-""Mucho Mucho Amor"" resonated with millions of fans across the world, and it's how I will remember his charismatic charm that influenced a generation of believers."

Fort Bend County’s COVID-19 Anti-Hate Resolution wins approval
By Kristi Nix

A resolution denouncing bigotry, antisemitism and hate speech espoused by extremists who target Chinese Americans on claims China caused the COVID-19 pandemic and conspiracy theorists who say Jews are using COVID-19 to make money drew both praise and harsh criticism from the public during Tuesday’s Fort Bend County Commissioners Court meeting.
During public comments, Sugar Land resident Ian Scharfman was among those who came to voice support for the measure.
“Sadly, this pandemic has given rise to hate directed at our neighbors, such as hateful ethnic slurs and other egregious actions directed at Asians and the proliferation of conspiracy theories tied to this pandemic that are founded in antisemitic tropes, to name a few examples,” Scharfman said and urged commissioners to approve the measure. “We must stand together to condemn such hate, bigotry, racism and antisemitism in all its forms.”
The resolution put forward by County Judge KP George, denounces “antisemitism, anti-Asian bigotry, racism and all hateful speech, violent action and the spread of misinformation related to COVID-19 that casts blame, promotes racism or discrimination or harms Fort Bend County Asian Pacific, Black, Latinx, Jewish, immigrant or other ethnic and religious communities.”
The measure also drew criticism from a number of residents such as Christine Longwood, who objected to the resolution because it wasn’t inclusive of every ethnic group.
“I noticed on the resolution that nowhere does it have Caucasians or white listed,” Longwood said. “Because a particular demographic is excluded from the resolution, it seems like a pretty racist document to me.”
The resolution states the Jewish community has been the target of blame, hate, antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories that claim they profit from COVID-19 and goes on to condemn terms like “Chinese Virus” or “Kung Flu virus” as language that encourages hate crimes and against Asians and Pacific Islander individuals and spreads misinformation.
Deborah Chen from OCA Greater Houston, a national civil rights organization that advocates for Asian Pacific Americans, said many Asian American residents contacted her organization for support because they were afraid to go to the grocery store or venture out in the community for fear they would become targets of hate speech or violence.
“The Midland incident is where a family was shopping at Sam’s Club and was stabbed and that’s generated a lot of fear among many members of the Asians community,” she said, referring to reports that an Asian family became victims to an alleged hate crime incident while shopping earlier this year.
According to police officials, Jose Gomez, 19, allegedly stabbed three family members including two children under the age of 10 and later reportedly told officers he tried to kill the family because he believed they were infecting people with coronavirus because they were Chinese.
“Unfortunately, whether it’s antisemitic tropes that rely on conspiracy theories that blame Jews for (COVID-19) or geography that has been the source of anti-Asian hate and violence, particularly what happened in Midland a few months ago, extremists and other people have stoked fear for their own agendas,” Anti Defamation League Southwest Regional Director Mark Toubin said. “We do know that public officials can make people feel more secure by publicly and officially stating that hate and this pandemic should not be related and that’s what this resolutions does.”
The resolution also “encourages” people to report any “antisemitic, discriminatory or racist incidents to the proper authorities for investigation,” which drew criticism from Simonton resident Andrew Perry who said although he didn’t condone racism he opposed the resolution because it limited his constitutional rights.
“You’re trying to limit our freedom of speech,” Perry told the court. “You make words prosecutable or investigable. This is a slippery slope. Where does it end?”
During court discussions, the resolution drew criticism from Commissioner Andy Meyers who also voiced concerns related to free speech.
“There are problems with potential first amendment questions. There are problems with potential HIPPA violations,” he said. “But I think most importantly, there are problems with potential violations of state and federal law in relation to how this resolution is worded to establish county policy.”
Commissioner Vincent Morales also voiced opposition to the resolution.
“This resolution condemns hate but it creates division. It does not show unity. I could see us coming together supporting a resolution that is not so divisive,” Morales said, without pointing to any specific part of the resolution as divisive.
When contacted later for clarification, Morales issued a statement via email:
“Fort Bend is internationally known as a diverse county, and I believe we’re a fine example of how so many different cultures, people, and beliefs can successfully thrive and peacefully coexist. The reason that we continue to grow so quickly is because we live up to that reputation. This Commissioners Court has stood time and again for equality, justice, and civility, and despite our different backgrounds and cultures — we’ve worked hard together to keep our community thriving,” Morales wrote.
“My major concerns were the policy changes, and especially after Judge George’s recent media appearances about unkind and racist social media comments against him — the vague language about citizens being asked to report on their fellow citizens’ speech was not the direction I expected him to go. Normally, our court takes policy decisions through a more deliberative approach. We were initially brought the first Anti-Defamation League Resolution and I had been working for days on being ready to vote in favor of it, to condemn hate and promote the peaceful unity of our community.
“I’ve still not learned why the ADL resolution was changed and picked apart to its final extent. As has been the case before with Judge George, I (and Commissioner Meyers) find ourselves occasionally on the outside looking in when it comes to input or discussion. As an elected member of the court, it’s regretful when I have been deprived of any deliberative or creative process,” Morales wrote. “I liked the initial resolution and was ready to support much of the language in even the second version if there had been any discussion at all from the other members. But they stayed silent, so my only choice was an up or down vote. I honestly believe that if this was an inclusive court that relished a diversity of perspectives, we would have taken the time to proofread these documents against embarrassing errors, involve more deliberation from all our members, and solicit at least some input from the departments impacted by the new policies. These are basic steps towards unanimous support and resolutions that we all can agree upon, and use to show love to all our neighbors as ourselves.”
The resolution was approved 3-2 vote with Meyers and Morales voting against the measure at a Fort Bend County Commissioners Court meeting held Tuesday, July 28."

Latino voters in Texas ‘much more’ motivated to vote in 2020, poll finds
By Benjamin Wermund

Latinos in Texas say they are much more motivated to vote this November than they were in 2016, with gun safety being a big factor after the shooting in El Paso a year ago, according to a new poll.
The survey of 800 Latinos who are registered to vote found that 57 percent are “much more” motivated to vote in November, with 74 percent saying they are “almost certain” to vote in the presidential race and even more — roughly 80 percent — saying they are “almost certain” to vote in the U.S. Senate and congressional races.
The poll, shared exclusively with Hearst Newspapers, was conducted by the gun safety group Giffords — one of a handful of national advocacy groups that have vowed to make Texas their big target in November — and the Latino Victory Project, a progressive group that seeks to grow Latino political power. The survey carries a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
The poll is likely welcome news for Democrats who have long hoped they will be carried to victory statewide by a wave of Latino voters — who make up 30 percent of eligible voters in the state, according to the Pew Research Center. But Latino turnout has lagged, with just 28 percent voting in the 2018 midterms, the lowest of any racial or ethnic group tracked by U.S. Census data.
The poll indicates gun safety could be a motivating factor this time around.
The vast majority of those surveyed supported stricter gun laws and most said candidates’ views on gun laws are more important now than in 2016. More than 80 percent voiced support for universal background checks and red flag policies that temporarily remove guns from those who pose an immediate danger to themselves or others. Nearly three quarters of the respondents support a ban on assault weapons.
More than 60 percent, meanwhile, said they sometimes find themselves more concerned for their safety or that of their loved ones when in public and going about basic errands since a gunman killed 23 people at an El Paso Walmart in August 2019.
“Latino voters want to live in a community without fear of gun violence and hatred fueled by anti-Latino rhetoric,” said Mayra Macías, Latino Victory Project executive director. “Latinos will determine races across Texas, and they’re ready to hold their representatives accountable at the ballot box.”
Nearly 75 percent said they believe that the El Paso shooter’s words about a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” were inspired by comments President Donald Trump had made about a “migrant invasion at the border.” Some 40 percent said Trump “does not really care” about passing gun safety laws such as universal background checks.
The poll found many are still unsure, however, where candidates stood on those measures. For instance, respondents were nearly evenly split on whether U.S. Sen. John Cornyn supports (26 percent), opposes (27 percent) or doesn’t really care (29 percent) about universal background checks. Another 18 percent said they did not know.
Cornyn sponsored the “Fix NICS Act,” which tightened requirements for states and federal agencies to report criminal history data to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which he says led to a roughly 400-percent increase in record submissions from federal agencies. Cornyn also proposed legislation after the El Paso shooting aimed at cracking down on people selling guns illegally and expanding mental health programs. It left out measures such as red flag laws and expanding background checks for gun purchases.
More than 40 percent said they believe MJ Hegar, Cornyn’s Democratic challenger, supports background checks, while 16 percent believe she opposes them. Another 21 percent believe she doesn’t care about them and 19 percent said they did not know.
Hegar has called for measures including red flag laws, repeal of open carry, a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks for firearm purchases.
“To win in Texas, candidates need to be leaders who are committed to stopping individuals motivated by hate from obtaining firearms,” Giffords Executive Director Peter Ambler said in a statement. “Motivated by the tragedy in El Paso, fed up with day-to-day gun violence, and ready for a new direction, Latinx voters poised to decide the swing state of Texas know where they stand on the issue of gun violence.”"

Zoe Saldana apologizes for playing Nina Simone in biopic
By Nardine Saad

Zoe Saldana has finally and tearfully apologized for playing the inimitable Nina Simone in “Nina,” the doomed 2016 biopic of the iconic civil rights activist and jazz artist.
“I should have never played Nina,” the Afro-Latina actress said repeatedly during an interview posted on Instagram.
“I should have done everything in my power with the leverage that I had 10 years ago, which was a different leverage, but it was leverage nonetheless,” she said. “I should have done everything in my power to cast a Black woman to play an exceptionally perfect Black woman.”
The “Avatar,” “Star Trek” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star spoke out during a lengthy interview about representation, racism and colorism with “Pose” creator Steve Canals.
“I thought back then that I had the permission to play her because I was a Black woman,” Saldana said. “And I am. But it was Nina Simone. And Nina had a life and she had a journey that should have been — and should be — honored to the most specific detail because she was a specifically detailed individual. … She deserved better.”
“With that said: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” the actress said through tears, later adding, “I know better today and I’m never going to do that again.”
It’s a far cry from Saldana’s unapologetic approach to the role back in 2013, when she told Latina magazine, “Let me tell you, if Elizabeth Taylor can be Cleopatra, I can be Nina — I’m sorry. It doesn’t matter how much backlash I will get for it. I will honor and respect my Black community because that’s who I am.”
The star, who is of Dominican and Puerto_Rican decent, was dragged for sticking with the part, which involved using skin-darkening makeup and a prosthetic nose to make Saldana appear more like the singer, who was proud of her looks. When the long-gestating film’s trailer landed and the film arrived in theaters in 2016, it was again with met harsh criticism and scathing reviews and drew ire from Simone’s estate and fans for Saldana’s casting.
Still the actress was defiant, telling Allure: “There’s no one way to be Black. You have no idea who I am. I am Black. I’m raising Black men. Don’t you ever think you can look at me and address me with such disdain.”
In her discussion with Canals, Saldana touched on current discussions of race and said she recognizes now when she should have done things differently. But instead of pitting Black people and Latinx people against each other, citing a recent Times article that appeared to do so, she and Canals agreed that the historically marginalized groups should work together to change their status from minorities to the majority.
“We need to stop the division internally,” Canals said. “We need to pull each other aside and say enough is enough and it means that we need to help each other up.”"

Opinion: College diversity trainings disappoint, spend on real disruption of racism instead
By Amna Khalid and Jeffrey Aaron Snyder

In response to the killing of George Floyd, the massive Black Lives Matter protests and pressure from students, dozens of colleges and universities have made public commitments to new anti-racism initiatives.
The University of Florida will require all students, faculty and staff to undergo training on “racism, inclusion and bias.” And Northeastern University will institute “cultural competency” and “anti-racism training” for every member of the campus community.
Given the vital importance of confronting past and present racism, we believe it is imperative that colleges and universities address racial disparities and discrimination in higher education head-on. However, as scholars who study race and social inequality, we know that diversity training suffers from “chronically disappointing results.” Recent research in psychology even suggests that diversity training may cause more problems than it solves.
Called into a typical diversity training session, you may be told to complete a “privilege walk”: step forward if “you are a white male,” backward if your “ancestors were forced to come to the United States,” forward if “either of your parents graduated from college,” backward if you “grew up in an urban setting,” and so on.
You will most definitely be encouraged to internalize an ever-expanding diversity lexicon. This vocabulary includes terms such as Latinx, microaggressions and white privilege.
In terms of reducing bias and promoting equal opportunity, diversity training has “failed spectacularly,” according to the expert assessment of sociologists Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev. When Dobbin and Kalev evaluated the impact of diversity training at more than 800 companies over three decades, they found that the positive effects are short-lived and that compulsory training generates resistance and resentment.
“A company is better off doing nothing than mandatory diversity training,” Kalev concluded.
There is evidence, for example, that introducing people to the most commonly used readings about white privilege can reduce sympathy for poor whites, especially among social liberals.
There is also evidence that emphasizing cultural differences across racial groups can lead to an increased belief in fundamental biological differences among races. This means that well-intentioned efforts to celebrate diversity may in fact reinforce racial stereotyping.
With its emphasis on do’s and don’t’s, diversity training tends to be little more than a form of etiquette. It spells out rules that are just as rigid as those that govern the placement of salad forks and soup spoons. The fear of saying “the wrong thing” often leads to unproductive, highly scripted conversations.
This is the exact opposite of the kinds of debates and discussions that you would hope to find on a college campus.
The main beneficiaries of the forthcoming explosion in diversity programming will be the swelling ranks of “diversity and inclusion” consultants who stand to make a pretty penny. Robin DiAngelo, the best-selling author of “White Fragility,” charges up to $15,000 per event.
In this belt-tightening era of COVID-19, should colleges and universities really be spending precious dollars on measures that have been “proven to fail”?
In our view, instead of pouring money into diversity training, colleges and universities would be better off using their limited resources to provide increased financial aid and better academic support systems for underrepresented students. The increasing number of scholarships and fellowships that have been established in George Floyd’s name are a welcome step in this direction.
We also recommend that schools invest more in expanding the full range of educational opportunities at their disposal to better understand and disrupt systemic racism.
This includes coursework, lecture series, discussion panels, student speak-outs, college-wide teach-ins, exhibitions, performances and common readings. Such an approach would enable universities to use the extensive knowledge and expertise that their faculty, students and staff already have on issues of race and inequality.
Campus communities don’t need diversity consultants to lead workshops about terms such as “microaggressions,” “micro-invalidations” and “micro-insults.” Instead they should discuss thought-provoking works such as poet Claudia Rankine’s book “Citizen,” a personal account that “strips bare the everyday realities of racism.”
Rather than simply declaring that “illegal immigrant” is an unacceptable derogatory term, analyze Jason De Leon’s “The Land of Open Graves,” a vivid portrait that “pushes our understanding of how lives are lived and lost on the U.S.-Mexican border to a new level.”
To explain the concept of “intersectionality,” replace “social identity wheel” exercises with an examination of the 1977 Combahee River Collective Statement, whose Black feminist authors insisted that it was not possible to “separate race from class from sex oppression.”
Facing urgent calls for action, colleges and universities have embraced diversity training to try to prove that they really are doing something to advance racial justice. But the relevant evidence suggests that in offering ineffective, superficial remedies to the complex problems of prejudice and exclusion, diversity training will shortchange campus communities and short-circuit critical thinking.
If colleges and universities want to effect meaningful social change, they will soon discover that diversity training is no substitute for education."

Opinion: For trans, non-binary folk, health care anxieties can make COVID-19 worse
By Eric Edward Schell

When I tested positive for the coronavirus, I went straight to Google and read articles and personal essays about the varying degrees of symptoms individuals had. The takeaway was that this virus affects everyone’s body differently. For three week’s this virus physically debilitated me, but the greatest impact was how it affected my mental health.
I am very lucky to have health insurance and a doctor who can monitor my health in the future, but my anxiety was worsened by the fact that I am visibly queer and a Latinx individual. I personally identify as a gay, trans-non-binary person. I have 10 tattoos and five of them are LGBTQIA+ inspired. Most recognizable are a rainbow band around my bicep and a heart with the transgender flag colors on my leg.
In Texas being gay is still a reason to be cautious and being part of the transgender community is sometimes a death sentence for people of color. In 2019 we saw 27 murders of trans and gender non-conforming humans in the U.S., and most of those deaths were Black trans women. In 2020 we have already seen 26 murders. As recently as 2019, Donald Trump’s administration introduced a proposal that allowed for health care workers to cite religious reasons to deny care to members of the LGBTQIA+ community. This hostility is very anxiety inducing when looking for a doctor who is competent and affirming of all humans.
Trans and non-binary people often deal with a great amount of anxiety, apprehension and sometimes fear when seeing a new doctor for the first time. Far too often we are met with non-affirming language in regards to our gender identity which can create debilitating dysphoria and trigger past trauma. According to a survey from the Center for American Progress, 23 percent of trans folks said they were misgendered or their birth name was used during office visits. During a pandemic, it’s disheartening to know that some folks might not be seeking medical care because of these barriers. Now more than ever is the time for health care providers to make sure they are taking steps to be as inclusive as possible.
I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had to educate my doctor on how to best care for me when it concerns my sexual health. I find it hard to believe a straight individual would be told they must get an HIV test when they are at a doctor’s visit for a common cold. I spend extensive amounts of time researching doctors before I make an appointment. I often have to make a choice about which parts of my identity are needed at appointments. If I’m there for a cold or something pretty common, I tend to check the boxes indicating I’m male and anything related to sexuality or gender identity, I leave blank. This usually makes for an uneventful visit free from discrimination. However, I am not showing up wholly.
There are private Facebook groups I am a part of that are really helpful to find out who’s had a good experience at a doctor’s office and which offices to avoid. Health care providers need to realize we are not asking for extra treatment, we are asking to be treated with respect and dignity. The knowledge we expect the doctor to have is not something that takes years of training to understand. It shouldn’t have taken me five years and several different doctors to finally feel comfortable with my current health care at Legacy Community Health in Montrose. Even adding pronouns to intake forms and or your email signature are simple and effective clues that your offices are informed and inclusive.
I am 35 years old, and aside from the occasional cold or very rare flu, I am fortunate to have good medical history. I have no underlying conditions and am not immunocompromised. As lucky as I was during the active virus days, I felt like a human time bomb. I was convinced that at any moment one of the harrowing accounts I had read about would become my kismet. That feeling has subsided substantially now that I have tested negative. The one worry I do have is the unknown of any long term effect that the virus has on the human body.
This virus is very real and wreaks havoc on our bodies and our minds. Those of us who are systemically othered for simply existing as our true selves in a heteronormative, cis society have added weights on our shoulders. For trans and non-binary folks, don’t be afraid to reach out to others for advice on where to seek care. For medical providers, I can not stress enough the need to be LGBTQIA+ competent and affirming. As a medical professional, I am sure you are aware of the language in the Hippocratic oath you took. The oath tells you to not be afraid to say “I know not,” and seek more education on a subject. Most importantly, leave your personal beliefs and biases at the door and do your job. Trans and non-binary folk are counting on you."

Opinion: Reinstate public power — Harris County must make new elections administrator accountable
By Judson Robinson III and Frances Valdez

On Aug. 11, Harris County Commissioners Court moved forward with the creation of the office of elections administrator which, as Commissioner Rodney Ellis and Congressman Al Green shared in a July 21 op-ed, has the power to “erase the legacy of a historically inequitable and discriminatory system.”
We strongly support this laudable goal and we support the creation of this office, but accountability to the public is critical. And we need that oversight now as the office is created.
During public comments at an Aug. 3 Commissioners Court meeting, numerous groups called for more transparency, accountability and community involvement, but many of their concerns remain.
Protect democracy
By creating the office, the court removed responsibilities and functions from the county tax assessor/collection and county clerk, and shifted important decision-making from an elected official to an appointed administrator. That’s why the court’s next step must be to give county residents official and meaningful influence over the role of the elections administrator. One way to do that is through the newly created Citizens Advisory Committee — but that will only work if the committee has the power to hold the administrator accountable to performance measures on registration and turnout. Harris County must ensure that this office is accountable not only to the Court, but to community leaders committed to upholding the spirit of democracy; and that the objectives of the elections administrator remain intact regardless of who sits on Commissioners Court.
Texas Civil Rights Project trains community volunteers to protect the integrity of elections through poll monitoring and other activities, and knows firsthand the role of community participation in maintaining democracy in Harris County. “For the Citizens Advisory Committee to be effective, it has to be established with the goal of creating a durable structure for a meaningful and effective relationship between the public and the County. Houston voters deserve a legitimate, nonpartisan committee, established in good faith, with a clearly defined and substantive role for community involvement,” adds TCRP Voting Rights Fellow, Louis Bedford, IV.
This committee should proportionately include populations of Harris County voters who have historically been disenfranchised and should be functional before an election administrator is identified so that the committee may play a role in the selection and appointment of the administrator.
Repair the damage
In the spirit of upending a racist legacy, we call on the Commissioners Court to strengthen the role of the Elections Administrator Office beyond its attention to “the security, transparency, and efficiency of county elections and voter registration.” To do this, we recommend that office be rated annually on its ability to increase voter registration and participation to levels that are proportionate to the county’s demographics by age and race. This performance data should be made available in real-time, online via a public dashboard, and discussed during a public meeting of the Commissioners Court.
Mi Familia Vota works to make sure that eligible Latinx youth are registered and motivated to vote, and proportionately represented in Harris County elections. “The measure of the office of the Elections Administrator should be how good it is at making sure the participants in our representative democracy actually look like its populace. That starts with creating measures that work to ensure that Harris County voters are registered and voting at the same rate across age and race,” says Angelica Razo, Texas state director of Mi Familia Vota.
Operate transparently
Finally, we submit that the Election Administrator Office be required to publicly post its proposed election plan no less than two weeks before adoption, in order to solicit and respond to public feedback before it is finalized. The Election Administrator Office should also be required to publicly post all substantive changes to that plan and, prior to implementation, receive approval from Commissioners Court following a public hearing of these changes. These may include, but are not limited to changes to polling locations, their closure or consolidations.
MOVE Texas works to protect the rights of Harris County voters. “The Harris County Tax Assessor/Collector’s Office has been responsible for voter registration because it used to collect poll taxes from people of color, so the struggles voters face here go way back. This office must create ways to hold the Office of Election Administrator accountable to not only the Commissioners Court, but also to those who are, and who have historically been, directly impacted by the prior system; one that carries the legacy of the Jim Crow era,” adds Alán de León, Houston Advocacy Organizer at MOVE Texas.
We support the creation of the Harris County Office of Election Administrator. Like the people and systems that governed elections that have come before it, this office has the potential to live on for decades, and for its impact to be felt for generations. That is why it is now, at its formation, the court must implement these standards and ensure that this new system remains accountable to the residents of Harris County for generations to come."

Opinion: Harris County buyout may have our houses — but not our dignity.
By Dolores Mendoza and Gabrielle Luebano

No one came to help us during Hurricane Harvey. We were on our own. Left behind.
We are sisters who live across the street from one another. When Dolores’ house got nearly 10 feet of water, her brother-in-law hotwired a boat floating in what used to be her backyard to get us out of harm’s way. As we left our subdivision by boat, the water covered the top of street signs and neighbors on jet skis were checking each house for evacuees.
The absence of outside help during Harvey is part of a long pattern of neglect for our neighborhood. There are only two streetlights, which we had to fight to get. Streets don’t get fixed, garbage doesn’t get picked up on time and the police rarely come when we call.
A month ago, we learned that our homes in the Allen Field neighborhood in north Houston near Greens Bayou is part of a new mandatory buyout program led by Harris County’s Community Services Department.
We are not against a buyout program. While some of our neighbors are indeed opposed to it, others have been through enough floods. We know we’re in harm’s way and want to get out, but we have to speak out about how this program is being implemented. Not just for our own sake, but for the many others who will share our fate.
Make no mistake, more buyouts are coming in Harris County. Our flooding issues will only get worse with climate change.
Harris County has an opportunity to be an innovator for these types of programs. The mandatory buyout program we’re a part of will set the tone for how future buyouts will be handled and how people will be treated. This matters in a place that calls itself one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the country and the energy capital of the world.
Harris County officials say no infrastructure solution can solve the problem — they have to buy our house. If proper investments had been made to protect us from flooding in the first place, maybe we wouldn’t have to lose our homes. If Harris County is asking some to give up their homes for the benefit of the region, it has to be done in a way that doesn’t heap the most burden on the places that got the least help in the first place. All we are asking for is an equitable buyout program.
Harris County’s current mandatory buyout program covers eight areas across Aldine, north Houston and Highland Shores. The county will purchase over 400 sites, 34 of which are commercial, and turn that land into permanent green space and detention. The seven areas in the buyout program area include several residential neighborhoods, four mobile home communities, small businesses, and even the retreat center for the Missionary Carmelites of St. Teresa. The program impacts about 2,000 people and 682 households.
Our family’s ties to this neighborhood run deep. Relatives on both our mother’s and father’s sides make up 13 households who live in this subdivision, and every one of them is a part of Harris County’s new mandatory buyout program. Our family has lived and grown in this community for six generations. Our great-great-grandparents met here, fell in love and started a family. We all rely on one another and continuously work to make this community better.
Displaced by Zoom call
The timing of this predicament couldn’t be worse. In the middle of hurricane season and a global crisis in which sheltering in place is vital, we have to face the realities of losing our home. The county says buying our homes and moving us into a new one will take about 18 months from start to finish. That might seem like a generous time frame, but the thought of losing our homes in the COVID era, when we’re already dealing with job loss and worried about putting food on the table, is almost unbearable.
The county program website describes the number of households and people who will be displaced along with their demographic data. In the census tract for Allen Field, 86 percent are nonwhite. Of the eight buyout areas only one is predominantly white. Because the program uses federal disaster recovery money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, non-citizen residents don’t qualify for relocation benefits. They will only be reimbursed for the cost of the property, so relocation costs will be passed onto families or prorated for the number of citizen residents. Some will be forced to pay out of their own pockets for movers, rent deposits, new mortgage costs and many other expenses.
They can’t get a straight answer on how much relocation money they’ll get, how straightening out things like deed or title issues will be handled and how property appraisals will be fair. The circular conversation (not getting a satisfactory answer on Zoom or getting different answers depending on who you talk to) doesn’t give people confidence to submit their paperwork to start the process. Dolores has all her paperwork filled out but she can’t get specifics on even the range of relocation benefits she may receive.
The county has sent letters and hung fliers with information. They have held virtual meetings in English and Spanish, but that’s not enough information for a mandatory buyout. When we call the number the county provides, it’s answered only in English, and the person who answers doesn’t know anything about the program. They just take down your information and say someone will call you back. But they don’t call you back. You have to call over and over to get answers about them taking away your home.
A recent town hall held over Zoom just repeated the same information we’ve heard before. We ask questions and get no clear answers. Nearly 80 residents in the town hall shared the same concern.
Our neighbors are confused, anxious and worried. We’re not sleeping from all the stress. We’re afraid we’ll be left behind once again.
In some other places, the community is involved in creating the handbook for these kinds of programs from the start. Other counties and cities across the country take a human rights approach to buyouts. This model is working in Mecklenburg County, N.C., and a Greenway Master Plan in Des Moines, Iowa, where they’ve adopted an equity lens. Harris County missed this step.
The fact that we flood as severely as we do connects back to environmental racism, systems that have put us at the bottom of the list for mitigation programs and allowed irresponsible development to increase our vulnerability after storms and heavy rains.
Harvey’s high waters impacted high-income neighborhoods, low-income neighborhoods, white neighborhoods and communities of color. While floods don’t discriminate, recovery often does.
Relocation with dignity
As we organize with our neighbors, we have also begun working with nonprofits, including the Coalition for Environment, Equity and Resilience, a local environmental advocacy group that is connecting us to experts and engineers who know about buyout programs.
The current program fails to take under consideration the fact that our property values have been depressed by a lack of infrastructure and because of discrimination against our mostly Latinx population. The county keeps telling us they will take our homes, but they have not asked us what we need. They are only telling us what the economic calculations say they can provide. We are asking for a program based on human rights so that we can be bought out and relocated with dignity.
Last year, NPR ran a story showing how buyout programs grow inequality nationwide, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is especially true in communities of color. We will be repeating the same pattern here in Harris County if we don’t wake up and change this program and future buyout programs.
The county is looking into creating a fund with general county dollars so that mixed-status households can be made whole. Right now, they’re conducting a study to understand how many households would need that help to determine how much money to set aside in the fund. That is the kind of solution we need.
We ask Commissioners Court to charge all departments with incorporating the 1998 U.N. Commission on Human Rights’ Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and immediately establish a fund for mixed-status immigrant families. Hire more bilingual case managers and benefits specialists so qualified staff can answer our calls. We also ask Commissioners Court to establish formal partnerships with nonprofits that can provide legal services and educate us about our rights.
The county should connect with the community to ensure the correct information reaches all of us. Ideally, these would be in our actual neighborhood and not just online. Many of our neighbors say, “que nos den a la cara,” meaning “come face us.” During the pandemic, we know it’s not safe to gather, so this makes the confusion, frustration and misinformation even worse. Communicating difficult information like eligibility of benefits or the process to relocate your entire life over a video call is so unsatisfactory.
My family has watched this neighborhood change over the course of nearly 70 years. It always flooded, but never this badly. The repeated flooding began when new development along Homestead Road and all around us left our neighborhood a low spot where floodwaters pool. Ever since Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, the flooding has gotten worse every year.
Our community is not just buildings on a map; it’s where lives and memories and connections exist. The home where my mother lives is the same one my great-grandmother bought in 1953. Every generation of my family has lived in that house at some point.
It’s also the gathering spot for our annual Halloween party. Dolores’ husband fills a trailer with hay and hooks it up to an ATV to take kids on a hayride and trick or treat throughout our neighborhood. Our mom prints fliers and invites all the neighbor kids to join in on the fun. It seems those gatherings, and many others, are at an end.
My family invested in this place, even when the county didn’t. We just want to make sure they keep up their end of the bargain as they move us out. No one should be left behind."

Mortgage holders falling through gaps in safety net
By R.A. Schuetz

More than 1 million homeowners are at least 30 days behind on their mortgage payments despite aid from the CARES Act, a sign that the law meant to ease financial stress and ward off foreclosures has let many fall through the cracks, data from real estate analytics company Black Knight shows.
Misconceptions, a lack of awareness and, in Houston, bad experiences with mortgage relief programs in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey have led to the pitfall, say housing counselors. The problem has led some in both the House and Senate to call for automatically enrolling borrowers who are 60 days behind on their mortgages into forbearance, or a temporary reduction or pause in payments. A disproportionate share of minorities were failing to take advantage of forbearance, according to Census data.
“An automatic forbearance would allow homeowners who do not reach out to their servicers a needed pause so they can have the opportunity to limit their arrearage, minimize fees and work with the servicer before they find themselves in a foreclosure,” argued Alys Cohen, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center, in a July 16 House committee meeting on how to protect homeowners during the pandemic. “Given the disparities in accessing mortgage help right now, adopting this policy would help prevent a huge wave of foreclosures in Black and Latinx communities in the near future.”
The CARES Act, passed by Congress in March to relieve the economic devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, gave homeowners who are struggling financially the right to take up to 360 days of forbearance if their mortgages are backed by the federal government.
The majority of the homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments likely fall into that category — 680,000, or 62 percent, are federally backed, according to Black Knight. Homeowners with loans not backed by government-sponsored mortgage-finance companies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can also request forbearance.
In fact, a higher share of loans held by banks and private-label securities are in forbearance than those held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: 10.5 percent, compared to 4.6 percent, according to the Mortgage Brokers Association.
“I can’t say it’s 100 percent across the board,” said Ellie Pepper, head of relationships and innovations for the National Housing Resource Center, of forbearance options offered for loans not backed by the government. “But we’re seeing and hearing that a lot of them are offering something.”
However, some Houston housing counselors, who provide homeowners free mortgage advice, said some clients are wary of forbearance because of the way it was rolled out after Hurricane Harvey. Homeowners impacted by the natural disaster were allowed to pause payments on their mortgages for six months, but all six months’ worth of payments were due in a lump sum payment when the period came to an end.
“So many families, after Hurricane Harvey, fell victim to some practices where they were not aware (that) at the end of the deferral period, all of those dollars became due,” said Kathy Payton, chief executive of Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment, which offers free housing counseling. “So some families are distrustful of the lending environment. They think it’s set up for failure.”
There are key differences between forbearance provided by the CARES Act and forbearance in the wake of Harvey.
Homeowners experiencing financial stress because of COVID-19 and whose mortgages are backed by the federal government are protected from lump sum payments if they would prefer to make other arrangements. Those can include a repayment agreement that involves making up the missed payments over time; a partial claim, which involves making up the missed payments at the end of the loan; or a modification, which may change the interest rate or number of years the mortgage will last. A housing counselor approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development will be familiar with the options and can provide free guidance to homeowners on how to communicate with their servicers.
The National Housing Resource Center surveyed housing counselors in July about problems faced by homeowners. Nine out of 10 counselors said they had heard from families who are delinquent, or about to become delinquent, on their mortgage payments.
The majority of counselors — 70 percent — said they had clients who knew about forbearance, but were afraid they would have to pay a lump sum repayment at the end of forbearance, which is not true for federally backed mortgages and can be negotiated with servicers for other types of mortgages. Fifty-seven percent said they had also had clients who were unaware forbearance was an option.
Housing counselors have also reported hearing about forbearance-related scams. As a result, when a homeowner receives a letter promising relief on mortgage payments, they may not be sure whether it’s legitimate, Pepper explained.
Pepper recommended that homeowners who are struggling financially reach out to a HUD- approved housing counselor to talk through options.
“In the financial crisis, it was proven that people who worked with a HUD counseling agency (got better loan modification options) than people who did not go through a housing counseling agency,” she said. “Different lenders work in different ways, but the bottom line is that’s something the housing counselor can help figure out.”"

Grace Rodriguez and Impact Hub strive for inclusion in Houston’s startup community
By Dwight Silverman

If you’ve paid attention to Houston’s tech community for any length of time, you likely know the name Grace Rodriguez. A self-professed serial entrepreneur and social-media presence, she’s been starting businesses here since she helped launch a DJ collective known as the Kracker Nuttz in 1999.
At 46, she’s still at it. Most recently, Rodriguez is co-founder and chief executive of the Houston branch of Impact Hub, an international network of startup accelerators with outposts in more than 100 locations in 50 countries. Impact Hub focuses on helping founders from underrepresented communities, and each operates differently.
Prior to starting Impact Hub Houston, she co-founded Station Houston, one of the city’s highest profile tech startup accelerators, now owned by Austin-based Capital Factory, where she still serves as a mentor to its startup cohorts. She also serves as an adviser at the TMC Innovation Institute.
Oh, and she also co-owns a bar, Dean’s Downtown, where — when it’s not closed under pandemic-related orders from the governor — it’s a meeting spot for Houston’s tech and social-media communities.
The Chronicle spoke with Rodriguez about Impact Hub’s mission in Houston, inclusion and diversity in the city’s growing tech community and the challenges it faces as the coronavirus pandemic drags on. The interview was edited for length and clarity.
Q: If you were to explain Impact Hub to somebody who knew nothing about it, what would you say?
A: Impact Hub is a global network of individually owned and operated hubs around the world that operates something like the United Nations, as a federation of hubs. For instance, Impact Hub Houston is a 501c3 nonprofit organization, but Impact Hub Madrid is for-profit. Each one opts into the protocols of the network and the guidelines and pays a fee to be a part of the network. Impact Hub, the company is based in Vienna, Austria.
Q: What’s the mission?
A: Impact Hub itself commits to the mission of supporting entrepreneurial solutions towards the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.
Some people call those types of ventures social enterprises, social ventures, impact entrepreneurship or social entrepreneurship. (The ventures’ goals) range from no hunger, no poverty, gender equality to industry innovation and infrastructure.
We have found that we need to do a lot more education on those topics. which means we are more program-driven versus space-driven. The vision of Impact Hub is a just and sustainable world where business and profit are in service of people and planet.
Q: Do you operate like other accelerators, where you work with specific entrepreneurs and have startups grouped into cohorts?
A: Some Impact Hubs do.
Then there are some Impact Hubs that are primarily co-working based. We are kind of a hybrid of where we had just recently launched this Accelerate membership, which is not cohort based. It is more ongoing support, but with an accelerator model. We would like to get to the point where we are partnering with, whether it's a diversity fund or a platform where people can raise funding through, to provide them with capital as well, because we understand that's one of the biggest challenges for diverse entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs.
So it's kind of like a hyper-local approach to global change.
Q: What’s an example of an Impact Hub success that you've been proud of?
A: One thing is making sure that more diverse people are on (tech conference) panels. And that our diverse organizations are included in the ecosystem.
If you want a specific example for a startup, there’s Amazing Bond. Varina Rush is a cofounder of Amazing Bond and they support seniors who need care. She came to Impact Hub at the beginning of their journey. They didn't know exactly how to structure the organization, how to grow it, what kind of tech tools that they needed to use.
And through the course of being engaged with Impact Hub, they were tapped into the Acumen Academy’s social entrepreneurship curriculum. We've provided her with a few mentoring sessions, and I would say we’ve given her confidence.
Q: Do you think in general that Houston's technology and innovation community, as is the case with a lot of others around the country, has a diversity issue? Do startups with founders from underrepresented communities get left out of funding?
A: Well, I don't think it's intentional. I've never thought it was.
When we first started Station and I was talking with Bob Harvey from the Greater Houston Partnership, he was explicit that we want to make sure that we have a diverse community, that we are supporting diverse people and startups and organizations, but he didn't know where they were.
It's just hard to find because a lot of it is underground or a lot of it's community-driven. It's by relationships. If you think about a lot of the corporate executives or a lot of the leaders in this space and their networks, those networks probably don't look like Houston, because that's just how they grew and that's no fault of their own.
I spoke on a panel in Austin for the Black Leadership Forum and you had dozens of Black-centered and (Black-)led organizations at this forum.
I said: I challenge every organization in Houston that wants to support entrepreneurs to specifically seek out an organization that is Black-led and Black-centered, and then see how you can partner on something. So with the African American Lawyers Association, how can we work together to hack solutions towards, you know, public safety?
I think that's what I would challenge a lot of the organizations that exist in Houston where there is a lack of diversity in their leadership.
Q: So what have you done to address that?
A: It's not just checking off a box, it's really, “What about supporting people in this community?” Impact Hub Houston is actively working with Baker Ripley because they have great Spanish-language programs for entrepreneurs.
We actively work with the Urban League because they specifically have a program for Black entrepreneurs. We work with the East End district because the majority of the businesses in their district, are Hispanic or Latinx owners.
If we can role-model it and we can show other organizations how to do it, I am finding that other organizations will do it, they just didn't know how to start. And I think that we're now we're at a good place where we're actually going to see a tsunami of support.
Q: How has the pandemic and everything going virtual affected both your efforts at Impact Hub as well as the ongoing growth of Houston's technology community?
A: One of the things that was a driving rubric for how we decide on what and how we sell our programs, how we do events for Impact Hub Houston has been: How do we meet people where they are? And that is psychologically and physically.
That's one of the reasons why we partnered with (co-working space) The Cannon, to make sure that we could do programs in places around the city where the candidate locations are. That’s also why we partnered with Baker Ripley, so we can do programs at all of the different Baker Ripley community centers around the city.
Houston has always had this problem of sprawl. And I feel like one of the opportunities that the pandemic presented was now people have to learn how to use virtual, online programs so that they can connect and they can work together and have meetings and learn.
There are a lot of people who don't know how to use tech tools and now they have had to. And one of the benefits of the pandemic has been that we don't have to focus so much effort on doing so many programs a week because now other Impact Hubs around the world are doing programs that we can offer to our members.
Q: How has that worked out?
A: It has definitely hurt all of the happy hours and the social events, which is a big part of Houston's culture, you know? I'm a partner in a bar and we hosted a lot of the Houston tech meetups and it's kind of sad that we can't get together right now, but we can do virtual happy hours.
We just have to rethink how we operate in virtual spaces. How do we still feel connected? It does feel different, but until we can be in spaces together and in ways that are safe for everybody, I don't want have a super-spreader event, right?
So until it is safe to convene in physical space, let's get better at doing virtual connections. And if Houston can lead in that, then we will help solve our sprawl problem. And then we can also be a role model for how other large cities like ours or large regions like ours deal with this problem."

Dr. Keila Lopez is devoted to improving healthcare for Latino and Black communities
By Lindsay Peyton

For Dr. Keila Lopez, public health comes first — with pediatric cardiology a close second.
That’s because, Lopez said, every field of medicine can be improved when the health of diverse populations are protected through equal access to education, medical care and quality of life.
“We know there are social determinants of health that affect your outcome, like where you live and what you eat,” Lopez said. “What’s your insurance? What’s your access to health care?”
All of that came into focus during the coronavirus pandemic, Lopez said, especially as minority communities reported higher numbers of cases.
“We know the community is disproportionately affected by this disease,” Lopez said. And she wants that to change.
As data became available from other cities, Lopez learned that Latino and Black communities were more adversely affected. That news set off an alarm, as she considered the ramifications for Houston.
“We have the most diverse population in America,” she said. “The number of front-line and essential workers tends to be people of color or in lower economic neighborhoods.”
For the past few months, Lopez has brought her expertise to Mayor Sylvester Turner’s Health Equity Response Task Force as part of two subcommittees: medical and public health. In both subcommittees, Lopez is working to ensure the proper messaging is going to minority and underrepresented groups.
The task force formed in April as part of the city’s relief and recovery efforts for the pandemic. It seeks to provide assistance for vulnerable and at-risk populations. The initiative is led by five division directors in the mayor’s office, charged with creating the vision and path to move forward.
Juliet Stipeche, director of the city’s Office of Education, said that the mayor wanted strong, female leaders on the task force.
“Dr. Lopez has a real passion for community health,” Stipeche said. “She’s just fantastic. She’s worked tirelessly with us, and she exemplifies leadership, mentorship and education.”
Lopez helped develop the Community Health Education Fellowship program with the UT School of Public Health. Participants explore public health education while learning about the work of community health workers and interacting with professionals in the field. Young adults participating in the program conduct outreach, advocacy, counseling and education in neighborhoods affected by COVID-19.
“She’s a fierce champion for the underserved in our community so adversely affected by COVID-19,” Stipeche said. “She has always been very inclusive and fights to get input from young people in the community. She’s just an amazing role model, too, very inspirational.”
As a Latina, Lopez is positioned to inspire younger students who might feel culturally underrepresented in the health field.
As the only Spanish-speaking physician on the task force, she is able to communicate the health risks and protective measures available to at-risk communities.
“I’d never envisioned being part of the mayor’s office,” Lopez said. “It’s been fascinating and rewarding work.”
She joined a virtual town hall in August that aired on Univision as part of a panel addressing the myths and misconceptions of COVID-19.
“She has gone above and beyond making an impact,” Stipeche said.
Prior to the pandemic, Lopez was already a leader, said Dr. Kjersti Aagaard, professor and vice chair of research in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital.
Aagaard has worked alongside Lopez as clinical provider at Texas Children’s and has seen her mentor students in pediatric cardiology.
“She is a superb advocate for her patients and for her colleagues,” Aagaard said. “This includes colleagues in training and those out of training. Her inherent ability to see things from others’ perspectives, with great empathy and compassion, is a tremendous asset.”
Lopez seeks new ways to care for patients with heart disease in their teen and early adult years, Aagaard said.
Originally from Chicago, Lopez cannot remember a time when she did not want to be a doctor.
“According to my parents, I’ve been saying I wanted to be a doctor since I was 6 years old,” she said. “I always knew. I felt in my heart it was what I wanted to do, and now I can’t imagine doing anything else.”
Lopez earned bachelor’s degrees in biology and Portuguese in 1998 at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, entered a clinical research training program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and earned her medical degree from Rush Medical College in Chicago in 2003.
Her residency in pediatrics was at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, where she then served as chief resident in pediatrics. Lopez earned her master of public health as a Commonwealth Fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, with a concentration in minority health policy. The experience was formative. “It’s shaped how I look at the field,” Lopez said.
In 2008, she came to Houston for a pediatric cardiology fellowship at Texas Children’s Hospital, where she then became an advanced imaging fellow in pediatric cardiology.
Lopez completed postdoctoral training in comparative effectiveness at the Columbia Summer Research Institute in New York and became a junior faculty scholar at the Baylor College of Medicine Center of Excellence in Health Equity, Training and Research in 2018.
She has taught, volunteered, conducted research and interventions on best methods to reduce health disparities and improve access to care in medicine.
She was recently published in Circulation, the cardiac journal of the American Heart Association. Her article was about the mortality in congenital heart disease in the U.S. during the past 19 years — and how that demonstrated ongoing racial and ethnic disparities, despite advances in medicine and surgery.
Lopez is also the recipient of a National Institutes of Health early career grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Her mission is to create a mobile application intervention to reduce disparities in congenital heart disease patients by improving the transition between pediatric and adult care.
Currently, Lopez serves as “diversity and inclusion ambassador” for the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, as well as a co-faculty adviser for the Baylor College of Medicine Latino Medical Student Association.
She created the Latinx Brainchild Project, an initiative that pairs Latino academic faculty at Baylor with medical students who are interested in improving care, health and outcomes for underserved communities. Participants join in quality improvement, advocacy, research, educational and wellness projects.
“It’s been one of the best things I’ve ever done — to reach back and pull others up with you,” she said.
Lopez hopes to see more Latinos in health care. The only way to stop disparity, like what is happening with COVID-19, is to promote health in diverse communities — and to ensure that members of those communities are represented in medicine. “We’ve got to do more,” Lopez said."

Diverse Houston arts organizations to share a $10 million lifeline
By Molly Glentzer

Some of Houston’s Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous arts organizations that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have a new lifeline coming.
The Houston Endowment is partnering with the Ford Foundation to commit at least $10 million to support Houston area arts organizations in communities that are historically marginalized, underfunded and underrepresented in the narrative of American culture.
""Houston’s cultural organizations of color celebrate our region’s extraordinary diversity and foster our connections to each other. This initiative, which will provide meaningful support to important organizations during a time of great challenge, carries with it the potential to transform the funding landscape and significantly advance racial equity,"" said Ann Stern, President and CEO of the Houston Endowment.
The Houston initiative is one element of “America’s Cultural Treasures,” a $156 million fund-raising effort led by the Ford Foundation to recognize and sustain diverse organizations across the nation during a time of almost universal financial hardship.
Last week, the Ford Foundation announced that Houston’s Project Row Houses was among 20 renowned organizations recognized as “significant anchors” who will receive $1 to $6 million, plus $100,000 in “capacity building” funds, through the program’s national component. Bloomberg Philanthropies, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, the Abrams Foundation, the Alice L. Walton Foundation and Tom and Lisa Blumenthal supported that effort.
The Houston Endowment will collaborate with other local funders and the non-profit arts community to identify the regional grant recipients.
""These organizations represent the very highest ideals of artistic excellence and are truly America’s cultural treasures,” said Darren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation . “We hope that other arts philanthropists and corporations will join in increasing support to the many cultural organizations that reflect our nation’s rich and diverse history."""

Baylor students pass bill, urging administration to approve LGBTQ group
By Brittany Britto

Baylor University has denied to recognize and charter an LGBTQ+ student group as an official on-campus organization for nearly a decade, but students have not given up the fight.
The Student Senate passed the “No Crying on Sundays” resolution last week that urges Baylor administration to recognize and charter Gamma Alpha Upsilon, which spells out “GAY” in Greek letters, as an official student group, and to add a nondiscrimination clause to student activities. If approved, Gamma, which was created in 2011, would share in the privileges of other official student organizations, including opportunities to advertise their programs on campus, invite guest speakers, reserve university spaces for meetings, and receive funding through the student government.
Motivated by some of the unsettling experiences she has had since coming out as queer on Baylor’s campus, Sophomore Senator Veronica Penales, 19, wrote the resolution as soon as she was elected to the student senate last year. The resolution, which passed with 31-15, is the first from the Student Senate to directly advocate for the charter of Gamma Alpha Upsilon, Penales said.
“I knew there was going to be push back from a lot of people,” said Penales, who is a member of Gamma. But the support the bill has received from current students, alumni and major donors, however, “just screams how everyone is ready for this to happen,” Penales added.
“It’s 2020. … Times are seriously changing as a result of COVID and Black Lives Matter. The issues of human rights are highlighted constantly,” Penales said. “It’s also time for Baylor to grow up and grow with the times.”
Emma Fraley, senior and president of Gamma Alpha Upsilon, said the resolution is seen as a “huge success” that paves the way for the group to be chartered.
“It’s definitely a great first step, but by no means does it accomplish all of its goals,” Fraley, 20, said.
The university released a statement to the Houston Chronicle Tuesday, emphasizing that it appreciates the work of the Student Senate and its role in representing the voices of Baylor students, but that the resolution is “non-binding.”
“The decision-making authority related to this matter lies with the university administration, and ultimately, the Board of Regents. Both previously have made a strong public commitment to provide a loving and caring community for Baylor’s LGBTQ+ students. This commitment remains unchanged today, as it is embodied in Baylor’s mission that calls us to educate students within a caring community,” the university wrote.
Officials also noted that they have allowed LGBTQ+ students to meet and use campus resources through certain faculty and staff members, and the university continues to provide resources through its Title IX office, bias response team, chaplain’s office and The Spiritual Life Center, and its counseling center.
“The university understands that we must continue conversations to demonstrate love and support for students who identify as LGBTQ. We are all part of the Baylor Family and are called by Christ to love one another,” the university’s statement said.
But Fraley, who has worked in leadership positions at other chartered student organizations, said the resources Gamma has received have differed from the ones others have received, making the university seem disingenuous in its recent statements.
“It has inklings of separate but equal arguments,” Fraley said.
“The university claims to stand for things like love, compassion and justice. We should see this in their actions as well as their words,” Fraley said. “Here’s a group of people who don’t feel loved right now. Baylor has a commitment to upholding the law and upholding just basic human dignity. It’s a part of their Christian commitment.”
Gamma has seen support from the university’s LatinX Coalition, which consists of at least five student organizations, including the Hispanic Student Association, as well as support from several fraternity and sororities.
Baylor’s chapter of the NAACP released a statement Sunday backing Gamma Alpha Upsilon and urging the university to “treat all students, including LGBTQ+ students, with equal dignity and respect and to permit LGBTQ+ students to form student organizations” and participate in campus life. Such an “exclusionary policy” has not only had a negative impact on Black students who also identify as LGBTQ+ but also calls back to some of Baylor’s discriminatory history, chapter president Lexy Bogney wrote.
“Baylor University did not admit Black students onto their campus until nearly a decade after the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education, and we still see the legacy of this discrimination today. LGBTQ+ people are deserving of equal dignity and respect, which includes the ability to form student organizations like all other students at the university,” Bogney wrote.
Fraley said the group applied to be chartered on Oct. 23 and expect to hear back by the end of the semester. Students launched a petition the same day, with the goal of getting 5,000 signatures from the Baylor student body, and are seeking support from the greater Baylor community, including alumni and faculty.
Faculty Senate chair Matt Cordon, a law professor who also serves as a director of Baylor’s Legal Writing Center, said there are no set plans to make any decisions regarding the student bill during the Faculty Senate next meeting on Nov. 10, but the topic could be discussed.
“I’m someone who likes to have dialogue. I want to make sure voices are heard, and that’s what I’m trying to accomplish,” Cordon said.
Last May, more than 3,000 Baylor University alumni, students, staff and former faculty signed a petition addressed to university officials supporting the group’s fight to be recognized. Gamma Alpha Upsilon also requested last year to meet with the university’s Board of Regents — the entity that President Linda Livingstone said established its human sexuality statement — but the request was denied. The group’s application to be chartered was also denied last year."

Election Day anxiety is real. Here’s how to battle it.
By Julie Garcia

Elizabeth Walthall feels lucky to have Tuesday off from her job as a high school teacher, but she wishes she had work as a distraction from the anxiety-inducing national noise.
She voted early, so she plans to hang out with a coworker outdoors and bake — anything to keep her eyes off her phone and away from Election Day coverage.
Walthall hasn’t decided whether she will watch the voting tallies live or completely unplug in the evening. She feels she should be ready so she can be prepared for Wednesday with her students.
“I have been thinking about school for Wednesday. What do I do? Plan a lesson, keep it moving for a sense of normalcy?” Walthall asked. “Or should I have a backup plan, in case emotions are high? I want to give the students an outlet.”
Walthall isn’t the only Houstonian feeling a great sense of unease this Election Day. Dr. Jon Stevens, chief of outpatient services and psychiatrist at The Menninger Clinic, describes his patients as anxious, stressed and depressed regardless of party affiliation.
“A lot of people are still feeling isolated, uncertain or dislocated related to COVID-19, but it’s now a more complicated situation,” Stevens said. “Constant exposure to various political upheavals, tragedies and candidates who use really strong language… people worry there won’t be a democracy to wake up to (on Wednesday).”
One of Stevens’ patients has coined this “political anxiety disorder.” It’s not a clinical term, but Stevens gets the meaning.
“It’s a feeling that no matter the outcome, it’s the end of all times,” Stevens said. “But there have been other very partisan elections before, and there will be more in the future.”
Local mental health experts recommend maintaining focus on your personal situation rather than worrying about the country as a whole.
That’s nearly impossible for Walthall, a high school teacher in Spring Branch ISD who teaches AP statistics and “Seminar,” a college and career prep class. A majority of her students identify as part of the Latinx population; many are immigrants.
The election is personal to these students, Walthall said. Though many aren’t old enough to vote, they know their futures can drastically change depending on who wins the presidency. When her students are feeling stress and anxiety, Walthall empathizes but attempts to maintain a non-partisan balance.
“I have to walk that line where I want my students to feel supported for valid reasons without creating an environment that would be considered offensive to others,” Walthall said. “I don’t really have the luxury of grieving if the results don’t go the way I want. I have to be strong for my students, so I don’t even get to process it before I have to lead the processing of it for a group of young adults.”
Dr. Teandra Gordon, vice president of school-based health at Legacy Community Health and a marriage and family therapist, said people who have been in a long-term state of anxiety may believe that Tuesday night will be the conclusion to this season of mental and emotional unrest.
It is important to remember that a winner may be not be declared Tuesday, Gordon said; the electoral process could continue for days following Nov. 3, so that every vote cast will be counted toward the decision.
Before going to sleep on Election Day, prepare your mind for the possibility of not knowing who will win, Gordon said. Prepare for the possibility of lost ballot boxes, technical difficulties and close vote margins.
People must recognize what is within their control and accept what is not, she added. Also, avoid catastrophizing.
“In this election, you can vote — that’s how you express yourself and the control you have in this situation,” Gordon said. “The results are outside of your control, and no amount of stress and worry will change that. To help you maintain a more balanced perspective, know that the country has been through difficult times before and come back from it.”
There are ways to calm the mind, and it starts with disconnection from technology and ends with connection to other humans.
Being tethered to near-constant election updates has resulted in many people being unable to focus on anything else, Stevens said.
“They’re constantly focused on the election — through Facebook, Twitter, 24-hour news channels or wherever they’re getting their news — so they’re neglecting other things,” Stevens said. “But they feel they may miss out if they pull from the election coverage for a few minutes. So they fall behind on basic life care, whether that is sleep, healthy diet, exercise or anything that provides respite or distraction from the election.”
It is possible that people who follow news feeds constantly are looking for evidence they made the right decision, Stevens said. But often, they stumble upon more partisan and hostile remarks, like name-calling or the demonization of the other side.
Rather than read another think-piece on the election, Stevens recommends taking problem-solving action steps.
Self-care is about boundaries, Gordon said.
If you know you will be triggered by opposing opinions, Gordon advises against scrolling through social media on Election Day; instead, she recommends intentionally scheduling activities.
Take a walk, go for a run, call a good friend and talk about anything other than politics or COVID-19. If you like to cook, practice a new recipe for Thanksgiving or bake something indulgent.
“Be intentional about doing something that brings you joy, calm and peace,” Gordon said. “Because the external parts are things you can’t control. You can control your own self-care.”"

Editorial: Biden’s election brings relief — and a shot at redemption
By The Editorial Board

That noise you heard was the sound of relief sweeping across the country.
After three days of counting votes and nearly four years of a corrosive regime, voters chose character over corruption, unity over division, truth over lies — and elected Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States.
The moment was historic. At 77, Biden will be the oldest president in our history. Kamala Harris will be the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to hold the office of vice president.
It was fitting that Philadelphia was the place to push Biden over the top — the cradle of our democracy became the city that may restore the national honor tarnished by Donald Trump. Shortly after, the Associated Press also called Nevada for Biden, and other battleground states were leaning that way.
A cacophony of celebration rang out as soon as networks and news outlets projected that Biden had clinched enough electoral votes to win the presidency: Honking horns. The banging of garbage cans. Shouting in the streets. Sobs of joy. Flag-waving and dancing in front of the White House.
The soundtrack of a people desperate for normalcy, compassion and decency. At long last, the jubilant crowds seem to be saying: We can breathe.
Biden, who served eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president following a long career in the U.S. Senate, was lifted in his third run for the White House by a coalition that reflects the diversity of America: Black voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, young Latinx voters in Arizona and Nevada, Native American voters in the Southwest — the very people most harmed by Trump’s policies.
Under Trump, we have suffered through racial strife and civil unrest, a pandemic that has killed 240,000 Americans, an economic crisis that has left millions out of work and struggling to put food on the table, a diminished international reputation, the separation of thousands of children from their families — and the coarsening of public discourse.
The 45th president spews insults at his political rivals and anyone who challenges him, encourages his supporters to hurl ugly chants at reporters and anyone perceived to be on “the other side” and markets in racist fear-mongering.
True to form, Trump released a statement Saturday accusing Biden of “rushing to falsely pose as the winner” and vowing to start “prosecuting our case” on Monday. But his claims of fraud have proven baseless and it’s not clear what avenues his lawyers have left to challenge results.
Biden, who will win the electoral and popular vote by wide margins, represents the polar opposite of Trump’s divisive instinct. Throughout the campaign, he spoke of unity, of healing, of treating our fellow Americans as family, not the enemy. And true to his form, his first statement as president-elect echoed that message: “There’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together.”
In the end, Biden’s message of reconciliation and empathy won over Trump’s toxicity and ugly diatribes.
The election has been cast as a battle for America’s soul, as a referendum on character more than candidates’ stances on any particular issue. This editorial board argued in endorsing Biden that character wasn’t simply a matter of style but a seminal factor in effective leadership for every single issue facing this nation, including pandemic response, existential climate challenges, health care access and relations with our foreign allies.
Under Trump, the soul of America has indeed been wounded. But with Biden in office, we now stand a chance at redemption."

Essay: What happened in the Valley? Latino voters were for Democrats to lose — and they did.
By Luis Carrasco

The signs, of course, were there to anybody who was paying attention.
Sylvia Cervantes, 74, told Texas Public Radio back in October that she loved President Donald Trump and hated the Affordable Care Act.
“You have to have insurance? No, we don't. Especially if you live here in the south, you go across the river, you get all the meds and you get seen by physicians a lot cheaper,” the Webb County resident said.
El Pasoan Mario Falcón told the Los Angeles Times on Election Day that even though he grew up in Ciudad Juárez and his wife was in the country illegally, as the only member in his family who could vote, his support was for Trump.
“I know some people find him kind of racist,” Falcón said. “But he hasn’t done anything that affects my economy. I understand that he might be a little bit against Hispanics, but he hasn’t done anything against me.”
That kind of logic is baffling. Right from his 2015 campaign announcement, Trump has demonized Latinos in word and targeted immigrants like Falcón’s family members in policy. Yes, we had record low unemployment before the pandemic — built, by the way, on the steady growth during the Obama years — but Trump’s mismanagement of the pandemic has left many communities of color ravaged by COVID-19 cases, death and economic fallout.
The Latino community is not a monolith, but, man.
As the Texas results started rolling in on election night and it became clear the president was performing better than he had four years ago in border counties, I started disliking my own people so much that I wondered if it was too late to donate to the Trump campaign.
Votes on the table
There has always been a steady bloc of support for Republicans among Latinos, with about a third of the Hispanic electorate breaking for the GOP since the 1960s. Now there’s a party that has for decades blown opportunities to appeal to a segment of Latino voters very much aligned with touted conservative values of family, faith and entrepreneurship.
Promising inroads made 20 years ago by George W. Bush were squandered. The GOP’s famous post-2012 election “autopsy” report laid out the need to attract minority voters, with an appeal to Latinos leading the way. The Growth and Opportunity Report, commissioned after Barack Obama’s re-election, stressed the importance of diversifying the party and growing organically through outreach efforts in Latino communities.
The surprise this election doesn’t come from Latinos supporting the Republican Party, it comes from Latinos supporting Donald Trump.
Particularly stunning was the increase in support in the Rio Grande Valley, where counties moved decisively toward the president. Joe Biden managed to hold on and win in most, but the difference between Hillary Clinton’s 2016 performance and Biden’s was dramatic: In Cameron County, home to Brownsville, there was a 20-point shift to Trump. In rural Starr County, Biden underperformed Clinton by 55 points.
That is not the kind of swing that Democrats were hoping for.
Before we move on, let me stop here and note that, no matter what the New York Times says, Latinos did not deliver a Texas win for Trump. We’ll let white people take the credit on that one.
As Antonio Arellano, head of Texas progressive Latino group Jolt, wrote on Twitter, outside of the Valley, participation in Latino majority precincts was on par or better than for Clinton and Beto O’Rourke. About half a million new Latino voters cast their ballots during early voting and even if Biden had overperformed in the RGV, it would not have been enough to flip Texas.
A blue wave would have gone through the Valley, but it could never crest there. The president already scapegoats Latinos, no need for disappointed Democrats to do the same.
So what happened?
A valley runs through it
The answer invariably goes back to that monolith. No group is neatly homogenous. There are similarities and patterns, of course, and with Latinos it may be a common language, ancestry, religious beliefs or similar cultural practices, but just look at the outcomes in the different states and the different “Latinos” involved. If you’re in Florida, you’re talking about Cubans and Colombians making up the largest groups (they definitely delivered the Sunshine State); if you’re in New York, it’s Puerto_Ricans and Dominicans; if you’re thinking California, Arizona and Texas, it’s Mexicans.
Drill down even further and you’ll find that Mexican Americans by themselves are just as complex and hard to pin down as everybody else. Our divisions can be as stark as they are petty. If I’m in Arizona having breakfast and someone asks if I want white menudo or red, I’ll stare them down until they realize there is no such thing as white menudo. Don’t even get me started on pozole.
Even among Texas counties, look at the disparate decisions among brown folks who check the Hispanic box. While the Valley turned toward Trump, El Pasoans gave Biden almost 70 percent of the vote, and Laredo showed about a 60-40 split.
What moved the Valley was a combination of factors that Democrats should pay attention to. In a broader sense this erosion of support points to the error that the Democratic Party makes in its appeal to minorities. If lumping all Latinos into one group is a mistake, throwing in all non-white ethnic, racial and non-Christian religious groups into a big bin labeled “OTHER” is probably not effective, either.
It’s vital that Democrats address social justice and structural racism (and explain what that even means), but it’s just as important they realize that we don’t all care about the same things. In fact, some of us don’t care at all. At least not for what others assume is supposed to matter.
Take immigration. Post-election, I’ve seen many angry white liberals ask a variation of, “how could Latinos endorse immigrant families being torn apart?” I’d say for the same reason that a majority of white voters seems to have endorsed it: they don’t care because it doesn’t directly affect them.
What’s more, Latinos who aren’t immigrants, don’t speak Spanish and don’t have relatives they visit in Mexico over Christmas may not take Trump’s insults personally because they don’t see themselves in the caricature he’s vilifying. He may be a bully, but they don’t feel he’s bullying them.
Visiting my hometown of El Paso during the height of the migrant caravan hysteria in 2018 — which, unlike COVID, did go away after the election — members of my own family discussed how Central American migrants were flooding the border, how entitled and demanding they seemed, and feared they would bring crime. Family separation was wrong, they said, before asking the same question surely uttered over non-Hispanic dinner tables across America: “but why are they endangering their children in the first place?”
And just as Latinos aren’t immune to debt, divorce, excess sugar consumption or any other ills in our society, we’re not immune to the unmistakable taint of racism and classism. The divides and hierarchies that are alive and well throughout Latin America hardly go away when a rich Venezuelan finds herself in Florida or a well-off Mexican in McAllen struggles to identify with a Guatemalan sharecropper asking for asylum in Tijuana.
Immigration also plays a different role in the Valley, where because of an increased focus on border security — over Republican and Democratic administrations — there is an alphabet soup of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that are major and coveted sources of jobs, customers and clientele. It’s easy to walk away from a party that is cast, even erroneously, as trying to “abolish ICE” or “defund the police,” and for every woke, young Latinx vote you gain, there may be a Border Patrol family you alienate.
Then there’s the urban-rural divide. The president improved his performance in rural communities by 400,000 votes across the Lone Star State, according to Ed Espinoza, executive director of Progress Texas. You would assume that a community racked by the coronavirus, as much of the Valley was earlier this year, would hold the administration at least partly responsible, but rural communities seem to be more in line with Trump’s efforts to buck restrictions and reopen the economy as quickly as possible.
There’s no giant
If Democrats ever want to win Texas, they’ll need every vote they can get. If they’re waiting on the “sleeping giant” of the Latino electorate to awaken, they are in for more decades of disappointment. The giant number of Latino eligible voters in the state — 5.6 million and counting — is not one mythical organism but a complex community whose members will have to be reached one by one.
Texas has traditionally been a low-turnout state, and while this election broke records, response by Valley voters was still underwhelming. Democrats there have gotten used to winning office by appealing to a core group that turns out, but they have made little effort to growing that group.
If Democrats want to appeal more broadly to Latino voters, they can start by showing up. And not just the week before the election.
Talking with voters, interacting with them on a personal level, goes a long way toward dispelling misconceptions and inspiring loyalty. Democrats’ interpretation of social distancing during the pandemic put them at a disadvantage with voters who prefer a closer connection than any Zoom call can offer. You also can’t just lay a cumbia track under a political ad, give lip service to “immigration reform,” and call it a day. Latinos want to hear about the same issues as other Texans: jobs, health care and a better future for their kids.
This is Politics 101, but it seems as if Texas Democrats still need some remedial work.
Democrats also need to groom young Latinos to hold public office. Getting to Lina Hidalgo running Harris County didn’t happen overnight, and while it’s wrong to pin your hopes on there being a “Latino Barack Obama” out there — a Great Brown Hope who will energize the Latino electorate and beyond — representation matters. Bill Clinton may have been called the first Black president, but we’ve come too far for a O’Rourke to be the first “Latino” in the White House.
The lesson from the Valley is that the Texas Latino vote for Democrats isn’t a given, and assuming it is is the best way to lose it."

In light of pandemic, flu vaccinations more important than ever for people at highest risk
By American Heart Association

The American Heart Association, the leading voluntary health organization devoted to a world of longer, healthier lives, is helping to keep families and communities safe from the flu by providing facts, resources and encouraging people to get a flu vaccine.
“Getting the flu vaccine is especially important this year. If you get you may need to be hospitalized, in this time of COVID-19, in an already overwhelmed healthcare system. Get your flu shot. Avoid getting the flu. Stay out of the hospital due to the flu,” said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., M.P.H., FAAFP, American Heart Association chief medical officer for prevention and former commissioner of health for the state of Texas. “In a normal year, the flu is serious and can even cause death.
While it is important for almost everyone six months and older to get a flu vaccine, it’s especially important for those at highest risk:
Seniors and people with underlying risk factors such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), those 50 years-old and older, living with one or more chronic conditions, are at high risk for the flu. Those who aren’t vaccinated are six times more likely to experience a heart attack
Children, especially those who are under 5 years-old and those who are back in school. Children who are vaccinated are 74% less likely to be hospitalized due to the flu.
Pregnant women - those who are vaccinated are 40% less likely to be hospitalized due to the flu.
According to the CDC, people who are Black or Latinx may be at increased risk for the flu and are least likely to get the flu shot. Over the past 10 flu seasons, non-Hispanic Black people were hospitalized at the highest rates and Latinx people were hospitalized at the third highest rates for the flu. Native Americans were second highest.
Some people have misinformation and concerns about the flu vaccine, causing them to skip it altogether. Here are some facts:
The vaccine does not cause the flu.
The flu vaccine cannot cause the flu. It may cause very mild side effects. The most common are soreness, swelling or redness on your arm near the site of the shot that might last only 1 or 2 days. However, the mild symptoms you might experience from the vaccine are much less severe than the flu itself.
It is safe and effective and easy to access.
The flu vaccine is safe and effective for at places that are taking extra safety measures like:
your doctor’s office,
pharmacy, and
some employers that are providing drive-thru vaccinations.
It is accessible even without insurance.
Many community pop-up vaccination sites, federally funded programs, local health departments, community health centers and some places like churches and community centers offer the vaccination at no cost for those who qualify.
It is not too late to get vaccinated.
Flu season typically peeks between December and February, so getting the vaccine now is better than waiting. You need at least two weeks for your body to develop antibodies to the virus. However, being vaccinated anytime during flu season is better than not at all.
“No one wants the flu. The best way to keep your family and yourself safe from the flu is by getting the flu vaccine and as with COVID-19 prevention, wearing a mask, washing your hands often, and social distancing helps,” said Dr. Sanchez. “Don’t forget to take your mask when you go for your flu vaccine.”
The American Heart Association’s flu vaccine campaign is made possible nationally in part by generous support from the Anthem Foundation and Sanofi Pasteur."

'Umbrella Academy,' 'Juno' actor Elliot Page comes out as transgender
By Julie Garcia

Actor Elliot Page took to Instagram and Twitter Tuesday with an announcement: he is transgender and goes by he/they pronouns.
Page, who plays Vanya in Netflix's ""The Umbrella Academy"" series, shot to fame in the late 2000s in the films, ""Juno,"" ""Whip It"" and ""Hard Candy."" The 33-year-old actor played an LGBTQ+ role in the Netflix miniseries ""Tales of the City"" and hosted and produced a documentary series ""Gaycation"" with Ian Daniel, a documentary filmmaker.
Page wrote: ""I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can’t begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self. I’ve been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community. Thank you for your courage, your generosity and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place.""
Though celebratory, Page sought to bring more understanding to the plight of transgender people, especially the Black and Latinx trans community, with his announcement. He asked for patience, saying his joy ""is real, but it is also fragile."" Though, he is ""profoundly happy,"" he is scared of jokes, invasiveness and potential violence.
""To be clear, I am not trying to dampen a moment that is joyous and one that I celebrate, but I want to address the full picture. The statistics are staggering. The discrimination towards trans people is rife, insidious and cruel, resulting in horrific consequences. In 2020 alone, it has been reported that at least 40 transgender people have been murdered, the majority of which were Black and Latinx women,"" Page wrote.
According to the Human Rights Campaign, murders of transgender, nonbinary or gender non-conforming people are disproportionately committed against Black women. In 2019, 91 percent of those murders were against Black women, while another 81 percent of victims were under the age of 30. Sixty-eight percent of victims in this group lived in the South.
Asia Foster, a 22-year-old Black woman, was killed on a west Houston street on Nov. 25. She is the first trans woman murdered in Houston this year, according to the Montrose Center.
Several LGBTQ+ organizations came out in support of Page's announcement, including Equality Texas, a nonprofit dedicated to securing equality for the LGBTQ+ community in Texas through political action, education, community organizing and collaboration. In a tweet, the organization congratulated Page for ""recognizing (his) truth and choosing to live fully and authentically."""

East End residents, organizers work toward bikeability in Second Ward
By Julie Garcia

A cluster of 30 bicyclists gathered beneath a gray sky, as raindrops splashed against their helmets. Not ideal conditions for a long and winding bike ride, but these cyclists — organizers and community members from across the East End — were on a mission. They would pedal through their corner of the city, logging mental notes about how safe they felt along the way.
Their feedback is crucial as Houston, and the East End in particular, work toward becoming more bikeable.
Cycling is not new to Houston, but it’s more mainstream now than ever, said Bryan Brown, senior planner for the county’s engineering department. And active transportation methods, like biking, walking and mass transit use, which can have positive effects on everything from the environment to citizens’ mental health, is garnering more support from local governments, Brown said.
First, biking has to be safe and accessible. Throughout the ride, many participants lamented the narrowness of bike lanes, the disconnectedness from other neighborhoods and lack of lighting along the Buffalo Bayou trail.
“Can y’all do something about the Kroger?” one community member asked about the Polk Street grocery store, the parking lot for which is riddled with pot holes.
“Probably not,” said Jessica Wiggins, an associate with Traffic Engineers, Inc.
She did explain the reasoning behind the store’s newly refurbished “floating bus stop,” which sits between the bike lane and the street to reduce conflict between cyclist and pedestrian.
A comprehensive bike plan — like the East End plan being shepherded by the East End District in partnership with the Harris County Engineering Department and Harris County Precinct 2 — is about working together to serve everybody, said Precinct 2 Commissioner Adrian Garcia.
Garcia is new to the Houston bike scene, having recently bought his first bicycle since childhood. But he’s started commuting on two wheels each day, and says his “respect for biking as an alternative to an automobile has been long in development.”
The East End has been changing rapidly in recent years, due to gentrification. But it is still considered predominately Black and Latinx. And that’s at the root of why Garcia thinks a bike plan in the neighborhood is so important. A recent health disparity study found that the Latinx community faces a number of health challenges.
“We want to create infrastructure that allows for safe commuting, whether walking or biking, and more opportunities to create a healthier culture,” Garcia said as he rode alongside community members. He listened to feedback from others while taking notes so he could fill out the survey himself. He wants to be active and lead by example.
Before the ride, he spoke with older women who said they use the Harrisburg Hike And Bike Trail to walk with neighbors and stay physically and mentally healthy. He also spoke with a young man who said he wanted to be able to bike to school.
“Even the incredibly young are giving us perspective about the trail,” said Garcia, who noted that these conversations deepen his desire to have a dedicated plan for the East End.
Jalil Cantarero attended the community ride to advocate for the students at Cage Elementary on Leeland Street, where he is a resource adviser. His goal is to make the East End more bike friendly for children.
Cantarero has pushed for more Houston BCycle stations in the area and wants to grow the number of kids riding bikes safely to school. Eight new stations were installed in December, including two in the East End, at Mason Park and the corner of Telephone and Eddington.
Stations are typically placed near existing or planned transit infrastructure or in popular recreational areas, like city parks, said BCycle’s director of new operations Doogie Roux. The Mason Park station is near trails and a bridge that connects to other parts of the East End.
BCycle bikes typically are not used for long distance or high-intensity workouts, Roux said, but they work as segues to people eventually owning their own bike.
“Even pre-COVID, Houstonians were trying to utilize different forms of transportation — they wanted to get out of their car,” he said. “By creating a transit network in a dense area with bike lanes, paths and the metro bus and rail stop, we are striving for cohesion.”
Roux sees several opportunities, like the East End Bike Plan, to make biking practical for commuting. It just takes groups working together, he added.
“In the East End, it’s important for longtime residents to be part of the process,” Roux said. “The East End is a very rich and vibrant community, culturally and historically.”
In recent months, new and expanded bike lanes have popped up all over Houston. In the East End, a stretch of Cullen Drive, just north of Interstate 45 was reconfigured to include bike lanes. On Austin Street in downtown, lanes that were made for vehicles are blocked off using curb blocks and painted green. Now, they’re cycle tracks.
Senior planning engineer Brown was happy to see six elected officials participate in the community ride. Fifteen years ago, that likely would not have happened.
“We know it’s important to the community, but having elected officials come out to a bike plan event like this — I thought that was cool,” he said. “It helps the general awareness or support of what active transportation.”"

Opinion: If ever there was a time to help Houston’s nonprofits, it’s now
By Amanda McMillian and Armando Perez

The coronavirus pandemic has focused a bright light on what’s long been a harsh reality: Houston is two cities.
One Houston is an “opportunity city” where folks with good paying jobs, successful businesses, comfortable homes and 401K portfolios have been busy with holiday gift-giving and dining.
Meanwhile, in the other Houston, families are struggling financially to survive. Parents lay awake wondering how they will pay the mortgage, rent or utilities after losing a job from a business closure or energy sector layoff. In some homes, families diligently work multiple jobs to barely cover necessities. An unforeseen issue like a car repair or medical bill topples their fragile financial balance and plunges them into crisis. Thousands of cars line up at area food pantries. Anxiety, depression, addiction and domestic violence have spiked.
So what can be done? The first step is responding to our community’s immediate, critical needs. United Way has filled that role for decades, especially in times of crisis. Calls this year to 211 Texas/United Way HELPLINE have surpassed 1.35 million, connecting neighbors with available resources for basic needs like utility assistance, food, rental/mortgage assistance, medical and mental health assistance.
But what if we could help more in our community to reach firmer financial ground, building the savings and assets that would avert future crisis for them?
Creating change on this scale takes the collective work and expertise of many local nonprofits, along with investments in resources that anticipate individual needs like job training, financial coaching, childcare, mental health services and more. United Way fills the unique role of identifying and assembling nonprofit and community partners to tackle challenges like this, ones that are too big for any partner to tackle alone.
Take Caroline, a single woman in her fifties. She was recently laid off from her job as a safety manager. Through our United Way THRIVE initiative, Caroline received career and financial coaching, help refining her resume and interviewing skills, and completed, at no cost, a certification program that makes her a more marketable job candidate. These services involved several United Way partners, all of whom worked with one purpose — to widen Caroline’s opportunities. Her example is one of thousands of families and individuals helped through United Way THRIVE this year.
Before the onset of COVID-19, nearly one in two households (47 percent) in United Way’s four-county area (Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery and Waller counties) were just one emergency away from financial ruin, according to the latest United Way ALICE Report. ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) data shows the number of working households in our community whose incomes aren’t sufficient to cover basic needs such as housing, childcare, food, transportation and health care.
Since COVID-19 arrived, the financial struggle in our community has grown more widespread and more urgent. In a recent poll by NPR, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 63 percent of Houston families — six of every 10 — reported having serious financial problems after the coronavirus outbreak. Nearly half of respondents (41 percent) have used up all or most of their savings and are having serious problems paying debts. Among respondents of color, the majority of Black (81 percent) and Latinx (77 percent) households report having serious financial problems, underscoring how historic inequities exact a harsh toll in tough times.
We all know someone who is suffering right now. This is your neighbor, your co-worker, your friend, your neighborhood restaurant owner, your aunt. Maybe it’s you.
The irrefutable fact is the needs in our community have never been greater. While the passing of a second COVID-19 relief package is welcome news, it doesn’t begin to address the mounting needs of the most vulnerable or the exponential resources nonprofits need to serve them. It also does nothing to address the fundamental financial disparities exposed by this crisis.
If COVID-19 has shown us anything, it’s that narrowing the opportunity gap between the “two Houstons” is one of the most pressing needs of our time. To get there, our city needs bold action and generous community support.
United Way of Greater Houston is entering its second century of service at an unprecedented time of challenge and of hope. Our Second Century Vision is focused on helping more struggling families achieve financial stability and a brighter future. We know United Way can lead this transformation in our community. To make this happen we need your help. Bridging the divide will help to create one Houston that is stronger together. Please join us."

Over 90% of Hispanics and Latinos don’t like to be called Latinx
By Olivia P. Tallet

A woman stands in a lobby while a facial recognition scan describes her as a Latina, one of the pan-ethnic identifiers most used among women of Hispanic or Latino heritages, as opposed to Latinx, which is only accepted by 2 to 3% of these multicultural population.
Latinx is a buzzword for individuals of Latin American origin in the United States, yet the use of “Latinx” as a noun to identify people of Latino and Hispanic heritage is not universally welcomed.
“Ooooo, you’ve entered the dangerous territory of ‘identity politics,’” said Rice University professor Luis Duno-Gottberg on a social media post where a journalist asked for opinions about the use of Latinx.
The word “Latinx” and its plural “Latinxs” spark passionate discussions, with supporters asserting it is more inclusive than the predominant “Latinos” or “Hispanic” to group the multifaceted identities of people who trace their origins to Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries.
Some analysts trace the original use of Latinx to the mid-2000s when it began to appear in web searches. The word started a slow trend upward in June 2016, according to Google Trends data. Some observers associated it with the mass shooting that month at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando where 49 people were killed and 53 injured.
Young activists gave a push to Latinx in political campaigns in the last election cycle. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., used the term in 2019 during her presidential campaign.
“Latinx is now widely used in the academia to reflect an awareness of the intersection of gender and sexuality,” said Duno-Gottberg, who teaches in Rice’s Department of Spanish, Portuguese & Latin American Studies. He said the identifier is mostly embraced by younger generations.
The logic behind Latinx
It isn’t clear who coined the word, but young scholars developed it as an inclusive term in the LGBTQ communities to describe Latinos who are gender nonconforming, said Duno-Gottberg. Latinx became an academic identifier to eliminate the gender markers in the Spanish nouns Latina for feminine and Latino for masculine.
The consonant “x” created a gender-neutral option in the United States. Outside of the U.S., the word Latine is used for the same purposes.
“I support its creation because it is inclusive of different groups of people that would otherwise be ostracized — communities like the LGBTQ+ that are often removed from conversations,” said Yaritza Acosta Corral, a recent UCLA graduate who studied Chicano Studies. “Latinx is a term that brings queer folks into the conversation and does not harm anyone.”
Some Hispanic-Latinos like the term because it was invented in the United States.
“I like the fun feel and vibe from this new label for our community. It’s fresh and we made it,” said Cathy Areu, a former Fox News contributor and founder of the magazine Catalina. Her company also produces the podcast “Catalina Stars Young and Famous,” a podcast promoted “for young and famous Latinxs,” where her 9-year-old daughter, Cristina, is the podcaster. “She understands this term, and so do the Disney, Netflix, Hulu and other teenage stars she interviews,” said Areu.
Areu is among people outside academia, many of whom are activists or in marketing, who use the term.
“It’s a more inclusive, nongender-tied option that can now be found in the (Merriam-Webster) dictionary,” said Jessica Bolaños Vanegas, CEO and director of a marketing firm in Houston. Defending Latinx on the social media discussion, she said she doesn’t relate to the predominant generalizers of Hispanics or Latinos.
Hispanics and Latinos
Identity words to encompass all people in the U.S. who trace their origins to Latin America and Spain have always been controversial, experts said.
In the United States, Hispanic refers to people with origins from countries where Spanish is an official language, regardless of their ability to speak it. The word refers to most Latin American countries and Spain, but not to Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language.
Hispanic became widely used in the country after the Census Bureau officially included it for the first time in the 1980 Census in response to activists pushing for a broad identifier inclusive of all people of Hispanic heritage, according to Population Reference Bureau, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the late demographer from Texas Leobardo Estrada were among civil rights organizations and Chicanos — an identity term used by many Mexican Americans — behind the move to create broadly inclusive pan-ethnic population identifiers.
Critics of Hispanic and Latino identifiers have pointed to colonial traces because their original meanings are associated with Spain, Portugal and France, three European nations that colonized Latin American countries.
Widely disliked
Many Latinos and Hispanics who are familiar with the word “Latinx” respect and understand it in the context of LGBTQ inclusiveness. But it’s overwhelmingly unsupported as a pan-ethnic identity word.
“For the population it is meant to describe, only 23 percent of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have heard of the term Latinx, and just 3 percent say they use it to describe themselves,” a 2020 report Pew Research Center found after a national bilingual survey of U.S. Hispanic adults. People in the 18 to 29 age bracket who are college graduates are most likely to have heard the word. However, its use as a self-identifier is low across all categories of age, educational attainment, preferred language, political party, foreign or U.S. born and women and men.
ThinkNow Research, another research firm, found similar results last year in a national survey indicating that 98 percent of Latino-Hispanic people do not identify with “Latinx.” The most preferred words to self-identify in this poll were Hispanic and Latino or Latina. They are followed, near or below 10 percent, by country of origin and country of origin plus American, such as Mexican American.
“One of the greatest challenges facing marketing departments and political campaigns today is the inability to discern signals from noise,” Mario Carrasco, ThinkNow’s co-founder and principal, wrote on the company’s Medium account about the use of Latinx.
One of the main criticisms about Latinx is its pronunciation for both English and Spanish speakers.
“Lateenex or Latinks? Cómo se pronuncia? (How do you pronounce that?)” said Danny Hermosillo, a bilingual news manager at Telemundo Houston TV. “When I was kid, I was called Mexican (even though I was born here, and mom is from Panama). Then they called me Hispanic. Then Latino. Some wanted me to call myself Chicano. Even MesoAmerican. But Latinx? No creo yo! (I don’t think so!).”
The Merrian-Webster Dictionary entry said that “More than likely, there was little consideration for how (Latinx) was supposed to be pronounced when it was created,” noting that the most common way is by pronouncing the “x” as the name of the English letter X, for a sound like lah-TEE-neks. The use of the letter X at the end of an English word is rare, mostly for medical and specialized terminologies .
“Latinx is a fruitful marker of diversity and inclusion, even though its use is mostly prevalent with academics,” said Maria Acosta Cruz, a professor in the Department of Language, Literature and Culture at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It’s in many ways a logical outgrowth of the trajectory of people of Latin American heritage finding their own identity when they live in the U.S.”
She and other experts suggest that most problems arise in these discussions when any moniker describing specific communities attempt to become an umbrella, pan-ethnic identifier for a much larger set of communities.
“The Latino community does not need to be exed,” said Al Martínez, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “Most Latinas, Latinos, Hispanics did not ask for it.”
Martinez added that “the idea of replacing a vowel with an X, which is artificial and alien to the Spanish language, shows a needless American phobia against gender in Spanish words.”
The issue of gender in language is not exclusive to Spanish. Around 90 percent of the world population speaks gendered languages in different degrees, including English with pronouns and where actresses are still called actors. International movements fighting for gender equality and opportunities for women have rendered small but important changes. The broad incorporation in daily language of feminine nouns such as “congresswoman” instead of “congressman,” and “policewoman” are examples in English. The use of the letter X as a gender neutralizer, such as in “womxn,” however, hasn’t been a successful proposition outside academia and limited circles.
Whether Latinx will ever become a preferred pan-ethnic identifier for people with Latino-Hispanic heritage is uncertain.
“So far, there’s a lot of resistance from communities that are proud of the Latino and Latina social struggles and don’t want them forgotten,” Acosta Cruz said. “At times, a designation like Latinx flattens out differences in gender and heritage. It also makes the political struggles of Latinos and Latinas invisible.”"

Baylor College of Medicine seeks 250 Houston participants for vaccine trial
By Maggie Gordon

Baylor College of Medicine announced Friday that it has been selected to participate in the phase three clinical trial for the Novavaxx COVID-19 vaccine. The trial is expected to enroll about 30,000 adults throughout the U.S. and Mexico.
Baylor is one of more than 100 sites participating in the trial for the vaccine candidate; the college is seeking 250 local participants to join.
This particular vaccine candidate will be called NVX-CoV2373. Unlike other vaccines currently in distribution, it is protein-based and includes an adjuvant to enhance the immune response. Its makeup means that the vaccine would not require the cold-temperature storage used for the Pfizer vaccine.
“(W)e need vaccines that can reach everyone and do not have extreme cold-temperature requirements for storage and distribution, which is one of the characteristics of this vaccine candidate,” Dr. Jennifer Whitaker said in a statement released Friday. Whitaker, an assistant professor of molecular virology and microbiology and medicine, is serving as a co-principal investigator at Baylor, along with Dr. Mary Healy, an associate professor of pediatrics at the college.
Whitaker, Healy and their team of researchers are seeking volunteers in high-risk categories to enroll in the study. This includes those “65 years and older, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and people of racial and ethnic groups that have been impacted in greater numbers by the pandemic, including members of the Black, Latinx, Asian American, Native American and Alaskan Native communities.”
Study participants will be divided into two groups, through random selection. Two thirds of the participants will receive two Novavaxx shots three weeks apart, while the remaining third will receive placebo shots on the same schedule. Researchers will follow all participants for 24 months after their vaccination to monitor health and safety.
As 2021 soldiers on, there will be an ever-growing number of studies and trials in the quest to rid the world of COVID-19.
“Multiple effective vaccines will be needed to vaccinate everyone,” Healy said in the statement. “One or two companies cannot make enough vaccine to take control of this pandemic.”"

U.S. Rep. Al Green praises Biden’s ‘suite cred’ following address to Congress
By Claire Goodman

U.S. Rep. Al Green (D-Houston) is applauding President Joe Biden following his address to Congress Wednesday.
Green, whose 9th Congressional District encompasses much of Fort Bend County and southwest Houston, commended the president for his humanitarian and civil rights efforts, even going so far as to coin the phrase “suite cred” to describe the president’s influence for social change.
“(Biden has been) energizing democracy and energizing the American people,” Green said. “This president, in a very short period of time, has made a significant change on the psyche of the American people.”
Green also lauded the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by Biden on March 11. “Help has been delivered with the rescue bill. People received $1,400 in their pockets, and relief came to schools, and counties and municipalities that have tax bases that have eroded.”
More importantly, Green said, the president is a catalyst for social justice reform during a time of upheaval. “Suite cred” is a nod to the term “street cred,” which Green described as having “credibility with the activist community.”
Biden has the street cred, but he also has credibility with “people who live in the suites of life.” In essence, Biden can speak to those who wield influence.
As a white male, Green said, Biden has the platform — and credibility — to make changes in ways that a person of color cannot.
“He can say ‘white supremacy,’ and people can criticize him, but they can’t criticize them in such a way as to have it stick to him … because he has suite cred,” Green explained. “He can talk about the LGBTQ-plus community and trans children, and do that with a degree of effectiveness that doesn’t allow others to condemn it in an executive way.”
Green believes that under prior administrations, Americans were hesitant to speak openly about issues like institutionalized racism and white supremacy. Now, with a president at the helm using the words openly and without reluctancy, Green feels that the people will follow suit, opening a dialogue that will lead to racial healing.
“Biden is becoming the nexus between communities,” Green said. “He has the ability to span the chasm between communities — LGBTQ-plus community, African-American community, Latinx community, Asian American community — he’s finding his way into the communities in such a way as to be a great benefit when it comes to changing the status quo.”"

Opinion: Pandemic hit Black and Latino communities hardest. Texas must address the root causes.
By Shao-Chee Sim and Ezemenari M. Obasi

For nearly 20 years, Guadalupe had worked in the same accounting job for the same company in Fort Bend County. Still, when the firm announced cutbacks amid COVID-19 last May, Guadalupe’s name was on the layoff list.
Losing a paycheck wasn’t her only concern.
“How was I going to survive without my medicine?” asked Guadalupe, whose last name is being withheld to protect her medical privacy.
Guadalupe is a grandmother of 10 who battles chronic asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Without health insurance, she didn’t know where to go for care or how she’d afford the growing stack of prescription pills she had to take every day.
At the same time, COVID-19 was hitting her family from all directions. Her brother died after getting the virus. So did her cousin. Then, her two daughters and their husbands were battling the virus. The economic and health effects of the pandemic were devastating her family.
“It was like we were hitting rock bottom,” she said. “That’s really hard.”
In Texas, their story is part of the larger troubling trend in which the pandemic has raised the stakes of health disparities and surfaced untold sufferings in communities of color. To support the state’s increasingly diverse population, we call on Texas lawmakers to prioritize practical policies that coordinate relevant data and research, expand health care for vulnerable populations and improve health outcomes for all.
We are encouraged that the House passed HB 4139, sponsored by Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, by a convincing margin of 86-58 to establish the State Office of Health Equity. Having a central agency to collect demographic data and inform decisions aimed at reducing health disparities is an important first step. We urge support from the Senate to get the bill, part of House Speaker Dade Phelan’s “Healthy Families Healthy Texas” priority agenda, across the finish line.
If we fail to implement strategies to address these exacerbated health disparities, the economic and mental health cost of inaction will grow even more in the coming years.
The disparities in how disadvantaged communities were hit by COVID are further exacerbated by untreated mental health challenges precipitated by unrelenting exposure to overt acts of discrimination, systemic racism, hate crimes, physical distancing, unemployment and other financial obstacles. While 41 percent of adults are reporting experiences of anxiety or depressive disorder amid the pandemic, the rates are even higher for Latinx (46 percent) and African American adults (48 percent).
As COVID-19 is now recognized as the third-leading cause of death in the U.S., the disproportionate death tolls in Black and Latinx communities were likely attributed to pre-existing racial inequities such as working in front-line service jobs, living in crowded and multigenerational housing, relying on public transportation, having underlying health conditions and lacking health insurance.
In a report released by Episcopal Health Foundation earlier this year, researchers found that if Black and Hispanic residents had the same COVID-19 mortality rates as white residents, there would have been 5,000 fewer deaths, reflecting a 30 percent reduction of total deaths by the end of September 2020. The economic value of these premature deaths is $3 billion.
However, COVID-19 cases and deaths have more than tripled, from 760,000 cases at the end of September to more than 2.48 million cases as of early May 2021 with deaths rising to more than 49,400. The early economic estimates reflect only a fraction of the final cost of health disparities in Texas during the pandemic. Nonetheless, one cannot quantify the true cost of an inexplicable number of preventable deaths of mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers at the hands of the virus.
We know that disparities like those endured by Guadalupe are avoidable — with commonsense policies focused on preventative health measures, not just health care and hospitalization after the fact.
State lawmakers have shown a willingness to advance health equity this session, proposing several relevant bills that include expanding health coverage and addressing barriers that lead to poor health outcomes for people receiving Medicaid. Approving HB 4139 will signal that curbing health disparities is a major priority of the state. But it should only be viewed as an important starting point. Lawmakers should also consider investing in social drivers of health in communities of color in areas such as education, workforce development, housing and transportation.
In the most recent data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas netted nearly 4 million new residents over the past decade, far more than any other state. The state is also growing in racial and ethnic diversity. Today, Texas is about 41 percent white, 40 percent Hispanic, 13 percent Black and 5 percent Asian. Texas will be even more diverse in the coming years with 90 percent of the growth coming from communities of color.
For state lawmakers to keep Texans healthy and the economy thriving, they must devote resources to prioritize health. We hope they will act soon and decisively. We simply cannot afford to wait. The price of inaction far outweighs the cost of addressing health disparities in our state."

Selena covers the April 2021 issue of Texas Monthly magazine
By Joey Guerra

The Grammys didn't do Selena right. But Texas Monthly is giving the music icon her flowers.
The magazine's April issue is dedicated to the singer and features several new articles exploring Selena's status as a role model, gay icon and fashionista.
""Why Selena Is Still the Queen of Tejano (and Punk Rock!)"" is a roundtable discussion featuring Jenn Alva and Phanie Diaz, of the San Antonio punk band Fea (both were formerly in Girl in a Coma); Bidi Bidi Banda singer Stephanie Bergara; and Tejano artist Veronique Medrano.
They discuss with writer Paula Mejía the ongoing legacy that has kept Selena at the forefront of music.
""Selena opened the door, and we gotta keep doing that,"" Diaz says.
The issue goes on sale Friday and will be available in stores and online. Mejía, who is from Houston, talked about Selena's unique legacy.
What was something new you learned during the roundtable discussion? 
That musicians working in many different disciplines – from punk rock to conjunto – have been massively influenced not only by Selena's songs but also her tenacity. She impacted Tejano music in a huge way, of course, but her work ethic and the specific steps she took to establish her career inspired a generation of artists, many of them Latinx, to take their creativity, run with it, and do incredible things. I love what Veronique Medrano said in our panel discussion about Selena's lasting influence: ""She gave us the seed to say, We can do more.'"" I can't think of a better way to describe her legacy. 
What is your relationship with Selena?
Before we lived in Houston, my family and I lived in Corpus Christi. We moved there in 1996, the year after Selena died. Even as a young kid, I felt Selena's presence and understood that she was an indelible part of Texas life – she, and her music, were in the air. I didn't get super deep into her music until I got a little older, though many of her biggest songs, like ""Como La Flor"" and ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,"" were around me when I was growing up. And the 1997 biopic, of course. The older I get, the more I am in awe of everything she did: her musicianship, her vision, her generosity, the specific way she honored her roots, all of it.
You're from Houston, which has a unique history with Selena. Does the bond here feel different from other places? 
It does. In particular, I think she had a hand in establishing a lineage of performance at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and it's become almost a rite of passage for Texas artists to make their mark on that stage. I get chills, still, whenever I watch clips of that final televised performance she did at the Astrodome a month before she died, especially when she's in the horse-drawn carriage and waving to that crowd. Also, the disco medley she does at the beginning of that show? Absolute bangers. You just feel the urge to get up and start moving.
The ultimate question – why does Selena continue to fascinate so many people from so many walks of life? 
Selena continues to fascinate people because of the joy and enthusiasm she brought to Tejano music while becoming a catalyst for its evolution. She was the ultimate entertainer. She knew how to work a crowd, put on one hell of a show and wore stunning outfits – many of which she designed herself. Selena looked like she was genuinely having a blast onstage, and you can hear that in the music. No one had ever done it quite like her. There's also the sad fact that she passed away at a time when she was at the top of her game. It's poignant to think about what else she might have been able to do had she not died at such a young age."

Texans more eager to return to theaters than U.S. overall
By Cary Darling

Texans are slightly more excited to return to movie theaters than much of the rest of the country, according to a survey from Fandango, the company whose portfolio includes the Fandango-branded ticketing/showtime site, movietickets.com, movie-news site Flixter, review site Rotten Tomatoes and trailer site Movieclips.
In the “Return to Theaters” Study, the company surveyed roughly 4000 people across the country — and with 15 per-cent coming from Texas —and found that 93 percent of Texans feel summer blockbusters must be viewed on the big screen with big sound and a receptive audience, versus 91 percent for the U.S. overall. And that difference was echoed throughout:
1. 78 percent of Texas moviegoers feel theater safety policies made the theater experience more enjoyable (76 per-cent US).
2. 97 per-cent of Texas moviegoers say fellow audience members and theater staff are responsibly masked up (95 per-cent US).
3. 79 per-cent of Texas moviegoers found their fellow audience members were more attentive than usual, with a decreased amount of texting and talking in the theater (78 per-cent US).
4. 95 per-cent of Texas moviegoers are excited for big new movies to arrive at movie theaters (93 per-cent US).
The biggest split involved film formats. Sixty-two per-cent of Texas moviegoers plan to see their movies in PLF (Premium Large Format like IMAX, Dolby, etc.), compared to 56 per-cent for the rest of the U.S.
Overall, it seems movie fans are eager to sit in the dark again with a large crowd. Ninety-six per-cent of the ticket buyers surveyed said they plan to see several movies in theaters this summer (with 64 per-cent saying that they will see five movies or more in theaters). while 87 per-cent say the movie-going experience cannot be duplicated at home.
The most anticipated movies of the season, according to Fandango, are “Black Widow,” “A Quiet Place Part II” (which opens Friday), “Black Widow,” “F9,” “The Suicide Squad” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.”
The study was conducted between May 3 and May 23, 2021. In terms of age, the breakdown of the group was 65 per-cent between 18 to 54. Fifty-six percent identified as female, 43 per-cent as male and 1 per-cent as non-binary.
Thirty-three per-cent were from the Western United States; 29 per-cent from the South; 20 per-cent from the Midwest; and 18 per-cent from the Northeast. In terms of racial background, 61 per-cent described themselves as Caucasian; 22 per-cent as Latinx/Hispanic; nine per-cent as Black/African American; six per-cent as Asian/Pacific Islander; and 5 per-cent other. There were a few respondents who identified with multiple ethnicities, says Fandango."

LatinX art show at Holocaust Museum Houston ripples with cultural energy
By Andrew Dansby

Let’s start with the feet. They connect us to the ground, they move us around. And they appear often and in varied forms in “Withstand: Latinx Art in Times of Conflict,” a bracing exhibition at Holocaust Museum Houston that opened April 30. Sometimes they’re used for satiric effect, as in Armando Rodríguez-Robles’ “The Choice, What Would Jesus Wear?,” a collage in which the Messiah puzzles over different forms of modern footwear. Gerardo Rosales created “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” by inverting six rubber boots onto thin posts, each of them rescued from their glossy, charcoal-colored existence by Rosales’ bright and brilliant figures.
Angela Corson’s “¡Ni Una Mas! (Not One More!)” is the piece, though, that grabs you with its digits, even if they’re toes not fingers. Twenty ceramic pairs of feet — draped and toe-tagged as if on a slab at a medical examiner’s office — are presented in a grid with three rows of seven. Before you correct my math, the 21st cell is empty, a devastating and fatalistic acknowledgement of the future. Each of the tagged toes bears a card in which the “Name of deceased” is filled in with “Your sister” or “Your cousin.” The Colombian native’s piece isn’t subtle. But it is startling.
Haunting as well is Monica S. Camin’s “El Rezo” — a condemnation of military dictatorship and cultural genocide — in which the names of slain Argentinian women are embroidered on a long, flowing piece of fabric that rolls toward its source: a dressmaker’s form, which becomes the epicenter of a devastating update of the old sheet-ghost trope.
More than 70 artists are represented in “Withstand: Latinx Art in Times of Conflict,” so the breadth of work on display is grand. Eulogization, protestation and celebration crash together like waves over the 100 works in the display, which is frequently breathtaking for its presentation, its themes and even its ingenuity. With the barest of materials — discarded six-pack plastic loops and a Sharpie marker — Lorena Morales’ “Still Here” makes a strong statement that goes from blur to clarity as one steps back from the unusual tapestry.
“I feel like this is something that hasn’t happened before,” says Geraldina Interiano Wise, whose “ONE Human Race” video installation is included in the exhibition. “These are voices telling stories that needed to be told.”
Wise has been in Houston 40 years, but her video piece is constructed from other works of hers, with lines representing family and forces of nature. The indigo central to her work was pulled from her native El_Salvador to connect her present to her past. She’s also intrigued by cultural prejudices about skin tone. A deep feeling for the enormity of time and an interest in science convinced Wise that skin color is a geographical and evolutionary construct that — in a greater consideration of time — is quite superficial.
“Why are we hung up on something like this?” she asks. “Especially when something like skin color, it can change.”
Exhibit delayed
Gabriela Magana and Rosa Ana Orlando curated “Withstand” with an open call in the Houston area last summer. The exhibition was a project interrupted. Holocaust Museum Houston originally planned it for last year as part of a collaboration with the Silverman Latin American Institute, which looked to bring 30 sixth to 12th grade educators together to study the Holocaust, human rights and social justice. It has since been rescheduled as a virtual event this July. Carol Manley, chief curator of Holocaust Museum Houston, tasked Magana, a member of the museum’s exhibits committee, to assemble a physical exhibition connected to the virtual conference. Magana reached Orlando, and they found the pandemic did nothing to tamp down artistic inclinations last year.
Hundreds of submissions rolled in. As they viewed and discussed the works, the two identified a few themes that provide a skeletal structure for the exhibition: the border, gender roles, the queer experience, domestic violence, environmental issues, the immigrant experience, religion and resilience.
Walking through the exhibition, Orlando admits, “Some of these works touch on more than one theme.”
Making the point for her, without words, Rosales has a second piece in the exhibition, with inverted mops, their tendrils arranged to resemble different hairstyles. Between his boots and his mops, the Houston-based artist from Venezuela makes a strong statement at a time when the phrase “unskilled labor” is finally being questioned.
Even items that feel ubiquitous on surface glance are filled with meaning.
Immigration and rust
“Withstand” strikes a delicate balance between seriousness and expressions of joy. Some of the most moving pieces are those that spring from agitation, but plenty spring from hope, family and love.
Genesis Meza’s “Taco de Nudo” is as billed in its title.
Another painting of a mortar and pestle, Orlando points out, “is an example of a thing that is impregnated with all the flavors from its use. But for those leaving, it’s too heavy to keep.”
It suggests an optimism tempered with sacrifice.
The first prize in the exhibition went to Jessica Carolina González, whose “The Respondent” is an inkjet print that superimposes immigration paperwork over an old photograph of her mother. The crispness of the type and the looseness of the color from the faded photograph meld into a foggy emotional tension. Angel Lartigue took second prize for “Forensic Burial Map of Cadaver After Exhumation #2.” The title conveys the content pretty clearly, but the presentation has an opacity that prompts further intrigue: Lartigue used vellum graph paper and pencil for a piece that feels both specific and ephemeral — the materials so structured yet impermanent as they document bones and bugs found at a burial site.
Both of those works are smaller in scale, pulling the eye closer. Third-prize winner Clinton Millsap was acknowledged for “Could Be King,” a bold portrait of an African immigrant and one of Millsap’s students. The use of an oxidizing iron paint mixed with an acid wash creates a hazy but mesmerizing effect.
Millsap says he’d grown weary of photorealism and “was looking for a way to create a different emotional connection to the work. It was a way to try to get out of a comfort zone.”
The resulting piece has the eye-catching power of monochromatic street art, but the oxidation process lends it an earthy variety, too. Experimentation, in this case, was rewarded.
Look into the mirror
An unstated theme that unites the exhibit is that of creation — an obvious thing to say for a collection comprising scores of pieces of art. But from Millsap’s experimentation with rust to Rosales’ use of vocational implements, a broad variety of media and implements speak in different ways about renewal. Artists throughout the exhibit ponder different forms of creation: from Wise’s meditation on our origins to González’s meditations on immigration to Rosales’ pieces about labor.
Violette Bule — a Venezuelan artist living in Houston — riffed on that theme, too. She contributed a few arresting pieces to “Withstand,” including “El Helicoide,” which Orlando says was inspired by a “building in Venezuela that was supposed to be a symbol of modernity. But what was supposed to be a modern mall never became that. Instead, now it’s a prison.”
The piece looks like a cruise ship overturned, a seemingly soothing convex shape jarred with harsh vertical lines representing the bars of its new use. The underside — perhaps representing the architects’ artistic intentions — has an elegance, but the top is presented as a matrix of ill-fitting pieces of scrap wood.
The idea of creation also flowed through several pieces that riffed on repetition. How does one interrupt a cycle so that it becomes a spiral? A shape that at least moves away from a single plane.
Beatriz Bellorin created a mesmerizing digital collage titled “Casualties,” a collection of Morse codelike markings that reminded me of Hanne Darboven’s work but with a heavier undercurrent found in the title. The piece served as a bridge between the exhibition’s resilience and social themes.
On the subject of repetition, Bule also contributed a piece with a tractor-beam pull. Bule tracked down 300 postcards from the Whitney Museum’s reopening in a new, fancy building six years ago. The cards read, “YOU CAN SEE AMERICA FROM HERE.” That she titled her piece “Can You?” explains it better than I can. I’ll leave the faintest of fingerprints here to say, the 300 postcards are accompanied by 300 mirrors.
And while these repetitive pieces suggest rigid cycles, they also are created with hope to break those cycles.
When Wise expressed her wish that “Withstand” become a traveling exhibition, its breadth and value snapped into sharp focus. With the flowing fabric dotted with thread in Camin’s “El Rezo,” the fading rust in Millsap’s “Could Be King” and the matrix of black and white ceramic flowers in Corson’s “United, Our Voices Will Be Heard,” the flux and fluidity of cultures codifying and adapting across time — big and broad time, not a single lifetime — felt resonant.
Rice University sociologist and demographic expert Stephen Klineberg has long suggested that as goes Houston, so goes the rest of the nation. That Houston would be the point of entry for an exhibit like this is mathematically logical.
Klineberg has framed our city’s demographics as a bellwether for the nation. The artists in “Withstand” don’t refute that, but they present these shifts with personal nuance, and they use not numbers but rather mirrors, paint, rusting paint, projections, ripped T-shirts, rubber boots, mops, wood scraps, ceramic material, fabric and thread, wood and all manner of implements to tell a story of the triumphs and struggles of cultures in a state of perpetual movement."

Essay: Each generation of queer Americans has had its ‘Godzilla’ hunting them down
By Robin Reagler

June is Pride Month, and we are seeing rainbow flags flying across Houston, in front of banks, diners and homes. Retailers are getting in on the act, marketing to LGBTQ+ customers like never before. Corporations such as American Airlines, Mastercard, Uber and Airbnb have added the RoyGBiv colors to their logos for the month. The added dash of color suggests celebration, and I want to believe that this city does, in fact, celebrate its queer communities.
And yet I find myself wondering whether this June display of gay solidarity is true allyship or “rainbow washing.” Do these businesses make policy changes that support their LGBTQ+ employees and advocate for their rights? Changing one’s logo stripes is fairly simple. Is the rainbow logo symbolic of social justice work happening in these businesses? Or is it an easy ploy to attract a broader consumer base?
As a lesbian in my 50s, I have experienced many historical changes as the LGBTQ+ community has fought for equal rights. Here in Houston, a landmark legal case, Lawrence v. Texas, went to the U.S. Supreme Court and finally made same-sex love legal. We elected out-lesbian Annise Parker to three terms as mayor. Following her lead, Mayor Sylvester Turner has created the LGBTQ Advisory Board. Gay marriage is legal in Texas and across the nation. These are certainly signs of progress. This spring, however, I’ve seen plenty to make me fear a backlash. Among the many anti-transgender bills introduced in the Texas Legislature, one would have criminalized parents and doctors who provide gender-affirming care. Though it didn’t pass, many families are shaken. In my own life, after accepting a teaching position at a religious school, I found in the hiring contract that I could not live a lesbian life on campus or at home, in my marriage or my family. The penalty? Instant termination.
Our families and livelihoods are still threatened.
I am an optimistic person. I’m known for my loud laugh and my friendliness. I say hi to people, whether I know them or not. But if I am completely honest, I’d say that being a lesbian has been a constant challenge and, in a way, the burden feels heavier when the narrative is all about progress. The progress is part of the story, part of my story, but only a part.
Growing up in a small Southern town, I waited to come out until I left for college. Coming out in the ’70s did not even seem like an option to me. I was not aware of a single person who lived a lesbian life. As far as I knew, the whole world was a closet.
One morning when I was a teenager, I was getting ready for school, and my mom had the “Today” show on as she made breakfast in the kitchen. I heard the voice of someone being interviewed, and for some reason I felt that I had to know whose voice it was. I dashed into the living room. It was Jodie Foster talking about her latest movie. I didn’t know I was a lesbian nor did I know she was, but there was something about her that made me feel a kind of kinship. I cannot explain the magic of that moment. But for the most part, my teen years felt quite lonely.
Since those days, some things have changed. When I was coming out, one person in 20 identified as gay, lesbian or transgender. According to a Gallup survey, today 1 in 6 members of Gen Z consider themselves a part of the LGBTQ+ community. It makes no difference how big or small that number is. What is important is that we create a world in which young people are nurtured and can feel safe, happy and brave, whether they are straight, gay, bi- or trans, using whatever pronouns they choose. What I wish for all young people is the opportunity to move toward self-knowledge and fulfillment, safely and with care for themselves and others.
I am a writer. I think one reason I began writing was because I felt so isolated in my youth. Reading gave me a way to explore the world, and writing helped me figure myself out. As a writer, I collect words, study them, hold them up to the light and watch them grow and glow over time. I have just published a new book of poems that comes out as Pride Month is beginning and the pandemic is ending. So I find myself thinking about my poems, these art objects made of words, and I wonder what they say about me and about the world we all inhabit.
In a poem called “Queer Theory,” a couple who are in love are constantly being interrupted by Godzilla. It’s a funny poem, but it also has a serious side to it. It includes an image that has stayed with me for some time:
In the gap between you
and me, no one says a
word, but Godzilla
lumbers up the movie
theater aisle, stalking
the nature of our
relationship like a mail
carrier, making careless
jokes about matters of
the heart.
Each generation of queer Americans has had its “Godzilla” hunting them down, hurting them, separating them from loved ones, taunting their desire for a life free of abuse and discrimination. And each generation has had to fight for basic rights.
The Stonewall riots in June 1969 took place in New York City, but the antagonism against LGBTQ people was happening across the nation. Stonewall represents the beginning of Pride, the community fighting back. It represents an important milestone.
Obviously the AIDS epidemic challenged the gay community in historic proportions. The U.S. government was criminally slow to address this health crisis due in large part to homophobia. I can remember attending protests in New York and Washington, D.C., in which police officers wore rubber gloves, a symbol that the protesters were diseased and untouchable. I also remember seeing the gigantic AIDS quilt, the size of many football fields, each section representing the life of someone who died.
There are many ways to perceive one’s life, strings of birthdays or beach trips or family reunions. The plays you’ve been in or the books you’ve read. Sometimes I think about all the many political protests I have attended over the years. I used to think that protesting was something everyone did. Certainly my children have participated with us since they were babies, for Black Lives Matter and against senseless wars. To protest is a quintessential American right. In Texas, however, it is not everyone’s way of making the world better. Pride is certainly a celebration, and that won’t change this fall, when Houston will hold its rescheduled Pride Parade. For me, though, protest has been at the core of my queer experience.
What is it like to be a queer in Houston in 2021? As I’ve said, you can now get married and divorced, just like straight friends. You can pay taxes and child support. You can create a chosen family or have your own children. You can go to bars that aren’t exclusively gay or straight. But, again, that’s not the whole story, not my whole story or that of other LGBTQ+ people I know.
This spring, when I found out the job I was so excited about came with the anti-gay contract clause, I was reminded of the rest of the story. I learned that it’s legal for an employer to have that policy if it is a religious institution, and of course I didn’t take the job. Also this spring, I learned that I could teach my daughter to drive a car, but I could not sign off on her driver’s license because as the non-biological mother, I was omitted from her birth certificate.
Yes, it could be a lot worse for LGBTQ+ people. It could also be a lot better.
In 2021 over 30 states introduced legislation targeting transgender Americans. In Texas over 30 separate bills targeting LGBTQ+ citizens were introduced, and many singled out transgender youth specifically. Thankfully, all these discriminatory bills were defeated. For now, at least. Many corporations did speak up, including the NCAA, which threatened to pull major tournaments worth millions from Texas if the transgender sports bill passed. I’m still not certain but I have to admit that those Pride logos could be more than rainbow washing after all.
And that’s reason to feel optimistic as we move into a post-pandemic world full of possibility once more. After all, the reason the rainbow is such an apt symbol of the LGBTQ community is that it has come to represent inclusiveness and diversity. We are Black, brown, Asian, LatinX, white, Indigenous, every color in the rainbow, and we are one. This is an idealistic idea about the queer community. It might not always be the case, but I do like it. I want it to be true. I want Godzilla to calm down and give me and my spouse a tour of the city. I want to feel free to wear what I want and cut my hair short. In Houston, as in other red states, as in blue states, as in every nation across the globe, we have more work to do. A more equitable and inclusive world would be worth the effort. I can feel it. Can you?"

John Paul Brammer joins Shea Serrano with release of ‘¡Hola Papi!’ in Houston
By Julie Garcia

John Paul Brammer has vivid Texas memories — of Houston especially.
In his new memoir, “¡Hola Papi!: How I Came Out in a Walmart Parking Lot and Other Life Lessons,” the author and advice columnist details a particular visit to Houston where he stayed at a Galleria hotel and imbibed in Montrose.
“We found a gay club called South Beach that was drenched in purple light and deafening pop …” Brammer wrote. “… I always got a kick out of knowing that in cities all over the world, there were gays with their familiar haunts. ‘South Beach?’ their texts might read to their friends every Friday.”
Brammer’s book, described as the misadventures of a “queer, mixed-race kid in America’s heartland to becoming the ‘Chicano Carrie Bradshaw’ of his generation,” chronicles his growing up in rural Oklahoma to moving to New York City and having his heart broken multiple times by a cutthroat media industry.
Starting as a tongue-in-cheek columnist for Grindr, a gay dating app, Brammer transformed advice-giving for LGBTQ+ and cisgender heterosexual millennials with his online-only column “¡Hola Papi!,” which can now be found on his Substack.
His first book publishes June 8 from Simon & Schuster. Each chapter starts with a reader question that he uses as a prompt to share some of the most vulnerable pieces of his life so far.
On HoustonChronicle.com: The feel of Houston suffuses new album from pianist James Francies
On June 10, Brammer will co-host a virtual book event at Brazos Bookstore with former Houstonian and native San Antonian Shea Serrano, the New York Times bestselling author of “Movies (and Other Things),” “The Rap Yearbook” and “Basketball (and Other Things).” The event will coincide with Houston’s Pride Week.
In the weeks before the book’s debut, the author was adjusting to post-vaccination life in New York while preparing for his tour. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: How did you start writing “¡Hola Papi!”?
A: It was 2017, and I was a freelancer at the time. I had just gotten fired from a job after moving from Washington, D.C., to New York — I lasted there two weeks. I didn’t have a full-time job, so no severance. I went back to Oklahoma for two months because I couldn’t make rent, and I sublet my apartment room. When I came back to New York for a job interview for NBC, I slept on the couch.
There were opportunities I had to pursue at the time for a paycheck. Grindr launched Into, which is a play on words that guys say on Grindr (like, “what are you into?”). I was trying to think of something I could do once a month because I don’t trust my brain to come up with something new to write about every week. That’s how the advice column happened to me.
Recognizing I wasn’t in the place to give anyone advice, I wrote it as a parody joke — like the gay Mexican man pretending to be an advice columnist on Grindr. But I received serious letters — it was a niche that hadn’t been filled. On Grindr, people are looking for something like intimacy; many of them are lonely. The gravity of letters I got, I knew I had to take it seriously.
Q: The book creates a vivid imagery. Did you journal growing up, and were you able to pull from those entries at all?
A: The book is about wrestling with authority and figuring out wisdom and how we tell stories to ourselves in our own lives. Those stories can sabotage us by telling them in a way that doesn’t serve us in the end. I wish I kept a journal, but I’m keeping one now. At a time, I did have a journal that I lost but I wanted to sound smarter than I was. It read so cringey and, like, I tried to be good at deep writing when I should have been chronicling my life.
A lack of records became the core of my book. Most of our stories are how we remember something and we don’t have the footage of what happened. The story we came up with is what happened. There’s a creative action and a degree of control in how we tell it. Memories are stories, and we’re storytellers.
Q: How do you identify culturally, and does that shape your writing?
A: At times, I have felt that I don’t feel at home in my identity, but terms like Chicano and Latinx really helped me. We can be accidental authority figures to another person without even knowing it, and being aware of that helped me in that role (as a columnist). Being a representative of Chicanos is really cool — I hope to do it justice.
Q: How have you been faring during the pandemic?
A: It gave me too much time. I certainly haven’t been the pandemic soldier, I would say. I struggled to adapt to a lot of things. My writing style, for instance — I love to go to a coffee shop and work for hours. I struggled to write at home because home is where I think about other things. It’s too crowded with chores and YouTube videos and wasting time. The outside world is about being productive. Marrying my house and work was really rough for me.
I would also say one of the most fruitful things to happen to me is I’ve been able to have more time to pursue visual arts and focus on drawing and painting. I run a print shop that had its best year because I was able to make so many different things.
Q: How do you feel people will see you after they read your book?
A: I found that I have very much been in a bubble when it comes to being a gay Mexican writer on the internet. I have been received on my merits and what I have to say. But the publishing world is different. I have come up against more rigid ideas about who my book is “for.” Some companies said it would be primarily for gay men. But is it? It feels very patronizing.
It feels like when writing these things — desire, love, feelings of love, pain, identity — I didn’t approach it (from a gay man’s perspective) at all. But overall, it doesn’t reflect you; it reflects the way a person thought about it. On the whole, it’s been a positive experience. Having people direct message me with their thoughts on the parts that touched them has been very special.
Q: Your Houston memories in the book are so familiar. Have you visited often over the years?
A: Quite a bit. My family is very much Tex-Mex that grew up in El Paso and Wichita Falls. San Antonio is my favorite place. Texas is my cultural homeland, where my roots are. To this day, I spend a lot of time there.
I’ve been to Houston a few times. The worst time was when I went with my former college roommates; their family lived in The Woodlands. I am horrified by The Woodlands, the Tommy Bahamas of it all was psychologically damaging to me. One of the worst things to happen to me was in Houston at the French consulate; I decided to go with an estranged friend there to get his paperwork to move to France.
But I miss the art museum."

Opinion: The NFL revealed the need for critical race theory
By Sean Smith

As of June 2, the NFL has decided not to hold Black players to a lower mental bar than white players to prove they have brain damage.
Let me repeat that: In 2021, the NFL has decided former Black players may not be innately dumber than former white players.
That’s right. The government-supported football cartel that kicked off last season with only 3 of 32 teams having Black head coaches while roughly 70 percent of players are Black, and that features a “Remembering George Floyd” section on their homepage while discouraging players from taking a knee in protest of racial inequality, has decided that Black Americans are not inherently less mentally able than other Americans.
Good to know. Maybe we can finally say racism is over.
Of course, some people say that racism stopped being a problem in the United States long ago, but no one seems very clear about when. Maybe racism stopped with the Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865. Or maybe it ended with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which gave former slaves citizenship and made everyone regardless of race equal under the law. Or maybe it ended almost a century later with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race.
But if race has stopped being a problem why do Latinx and Black Americans experience more than twice white Americans’ rate of poverty? Why do Black men have more than twice the chance of being killed by police than white men? Why is the NFL only just now admitting that its Black players are not innately dumber than its white ones?"

Plan to build 'first class' Latino cultural center in Houston gets enthusiastic support
By Olivia P. Tallet

A call for art for a juried exhibition of Latino art drew more than 200 pieces from more than 70 artists.
The number of submissions did not surprise the curators of “Withstand: LatinX Art in Times of Conflict,” but the quality of the art overwhelmed them.
“My goodness, it was mind-blowing,” said Rosa Ana Orlando, co-curator of the exhibition at the Holocaust Museum Houston. “We knew there were Latinx artists producing wonderful work in Houston, but we didn’t expect a collective level of quality of this caliber.”
That such a wide range of styles, vibrancy and avant-garde visual art created by Latinos had to be shown at the Holocaust museum — where 100 of the selected pieces are on display until Oct. 17— instead of at a Hispanic arts museum did not escape the attention of the art community.
Unlike other cities in the U.S., Houston — where almost half the population is Hispanic — doesn’t have a first-class institution dedicated to or capitalizing on the rich and untapped artistic talent in the region. A new initiative is trying to change that as its organizers champion a project to build a state-of-the-art Latino culture and arts center.
The effort just received $40,000 in seed money from Houston City Councilwoman Karla Cisneros.
Cisneros told the Chronicle that the funding is intended for a matching grant that will be used to assemble a diverse group of advisers whose input will help guide the planning process.
“I am so excited about this project and am thrilled to see all the enthusiasm around it,” Cisneros said.
Although there have been similar efforts in the past that didn’t materialize, Cisneros said the conditions have changed as the Latino population has grown and become more diverse and educated while the city is more aware of the value of their contributions.
“Times have changed, and today there is clearly much more of a groundswell of both interest and support… due in large part to the changing demographics of Houston,” said Cisneros. “Building a world-class, state-of-the-art Latino arts and cultural center helps tell the story of Houston and acknowledges the profound influence of how the Latino culture is shaping Houston’s identity.”
Enthusiastic grassroots
The initiative is led by a new nonprofit called Advocates for a Latino Museum of Visual and Cultural Arts and Archives in Houston and Harris County.
The organization’s first phase of the project is “advocating and raising funds to pay for the workstreams and expertise needed to create the critical paths to realize this vision,” said Geraldina Interiano Wise, the nonprofit’s chairwoman.
Interiano Wise said the organization will guide what she called a “grassroots effort to build a Class-A complex.”
The shape of the center and its programs will be defined with stakeholders, she said. But an initial concept includes a museum, performing arts center and facilities that would serve as educational, incubator and lab spaces to support creators of diverse disciplines and backgrounds. Latino or Hispanic culture would be a common denominator for art forms.
Another idea is to include a marketplace to serve as an outlet for creators to sell their products, said Interiano Wise, a Salvadorian American artist herself who is among those exhibiting in the Holocaust Museum.
Dorothy Caram, a member of the cultural center advocates group, founded the Institute of Hispanic Culture of Houston in 1965. She said she is proud of the work done by the institute and other small organizations supporting Hispanic culture in Houston. “But,” she added, “our city doesn’t have a wonderful, elegant building for Latino centers like those you see in Dallas and so many other cities but not in Houston, and we are the largest population group in Houston,” she said.
Sofía Adrogué, a long-time cultural and arts advocate in Houston and a board member for the new nonprofit, says the construction of a Latino cultural complex is a perfect fit for Houston.
The city, she said, is “egalitarian, with an entrepreneur can-do and will-do spirit… the nation’s demographic future (and) a rich cultural center where the arts thrive.”
Untapped vibrancy
There are more than 30 Latino museums and cultural centers in the United States, several of which are housed in contemporary facilities built specifically for the purpose. Among them is the Latino Cultural Center in Dallas, a 27,500 square-foot multipurpose facility that recently received $4.8 million from the city for an expansion project.
The National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, N.M., is another example and one of the models the Houston nonprofit is looking at, said David Contreras, another founder and vice chair of the Harris County Hispanic Culture and Heritage Committee. It is a 20-plus-acre campus that includes three theaters, an art museum, education center, library, genealogy center, a restaurant and a plaza that serves also as an amphitheater.
Many of the Hispanic cultural and history centers in the country are significantly funded by local and state governments, said Contreras who is researching the working models and budgets of dozens of Latino institutions in the U.S. as part of the first phase for the Houston project.
A recent example is the new Mexican American Civil Rights Institute in San Antonio, which received $500,000 in seed money from the city’s government.
In Houston, studies show that Latino cultural organizations have survived despite the limited and significantly inequitable public funds they have historically received.
For example, data from the 2020 Equity report from the Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs shows that Latinos have the worst representation in the Civic Art collection administered by the city. Only 5.2 percent of artwork in the collection is from Hispanic artists compared to Hispanics being 45.5 percent of the city’s population.
The largest Latino cultural organization in Houston, the Multicultural Education and Counseling through the Arts, or MECA, still exists after 43 years thanks to the work of its founder Alice Valdez. The MECA facility was falling apart and without air conditioning until after it received Hurricane Harvey relief funding in 2019. That same year, Valdez stepped up to temporarily run the city-owned facility that housed Talento Bilingue de Houston in the East End while the city decides on a new purpose for the building.
The visions
MECA, the Institute of Hispanic Culture of Houston and Talento Bilingue are all centers that have kept Latino culture alive in Houston at the community or neighborhood level.
However, there isn’t a Latino cultural center serving the Greater Houston area and its extensive pool of local talent, Caram said. “We still have a strong influence from the Mexican culture, but we are now more like a micro-world of all Latin American cultures,” she added. “We have all kinds of cultural manifestations, from the Argentinean and South American with strong European influences to the Caribbean with Afro Latino mixtures or the Central American with indigenous influences.”
Interiano Wise said the nonprofit wants to locate and support that talent and bring together artists and organizations as partners for the new cultural center. The center could become a tourist attraction and economic driver for the city, she said.
The organization’s provisional website, www.almaahh.org, includes information on volunteering, supporting and donating to the effort. An initial fundraising goal of $350,000 has been set by the group.
The founders said they have already presented the project to several elected officials, including Mayor Sylvester Turner, Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia and the office of U.S. Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston.
“They have applauded the idea in those first meetings and we hope it will translate into concrete support at some point, including financial,” Interiano Wise said.
City Councilman Robert Gallegos, who helped secure funds for the Houston Public Library’s Hispanic research and archive center, is a strong supporter of the project and has pledged to contribute financially without providing details.
Gallegos said some people would like such a cultural campus to be built in the Museum District. But he is among many others who think the East End area would be more advantageous.
“A lot of money would be needed just to purchase property in the Museum District, where real estate’s very expensive,” he said.
Cisneros said there are many possibilities, but identifying the location should come after other priorities are met, such as determining the project’s program needs and space requirements.
“I do have a personal favorite preference,” she said though, “and would love to see it located at the former TBH site,” at the intersection of Jensen Road and Navigation Drive, adjacent to Guadalupe Plaza.
Gallegos also likes the TBH-Guadalupe Plaza spot, on a strictly personal level, he said.
“Can you imagine, say, the backside of this new Hispanic cultural arts center to have balconies or a rooftop, and you’re there overlooking the downtown skyline, which is just blocks away?” said Gallegos. “It would be awesome.”
The nonprofit’s leadership team envisions a project worthy of the cosmopolitan, business-oriented, and visionary fourth largest city in the United States.
“It could be in that spot, but that space alone could be small for a large campus,” Interiano Wise said.
A challenge would be linking that spot to nearby spaces, perhaps along Buffalo Bayou, which is about a block away from the plaza.
“Can you imagine, say, people coming and going to the buildings of the center, this beautiful campus, by boat?” said Interiano Wise. “Wouldn’t Houstonians be proud of something like that in their city?”"

Latinx Artist Fellowship announces two Houston recipients for grant
By Andrew Dansby

Four Texans, two of them Houston-based, have been selected among a group of 15 for the inaugural Latinx Artist Fellowship. The fellowship provides $50,000 per year for five years to the selected artists. The funds are unrestricted, designed to allow the artists to better pursue their visions. Among those selected are Delilah Montoya, a photographer and printmaker from Fort Worth native who is a professor at the University of Houston’s School of Art. Another fellow is Adriana Corral, an multidisciplinary artist focused on history, memory and human rights abuses. The El Paso native who works in Houston.
The Latinx Artist Fellowship was created through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Ford Foundation, which committed $5 million to the initiative administered by the U.S. Latinx Art Forum and the New York Foundation for the Arts. The Museum of Fine Arts Houston is among the museums participating in the program. The MFAH’s Mari Carmen Ramirez – Wortham Curator of Latin American Art – served on the panel of art historians, scholars and curators who assessed the work of more than 200 nominees to put together the list of 15. Also on the panel was Sylvia Orozco, co-founder and executive director of Austin’s Mexic-Arte Museum.
LATINX ART EXHIBITION RIPPLES WITH ENERGY
The U.S. Latinx Art Forum began in 2015 with advocacy as an umbrella for a range of goals. “We have been advocating for the work of Latinx visual artists through data collection, equity and inclusion initiatives, microgrants and community building,” said Dr. Adriana Zavala the organization’s director.
Zavala said Latinx artists’ “historical contributions to the American experience have been largely ignored and made invisible within the art world and academic ecosystems.”"

Menninger Clinic, Health Museum to host virtual minority mental health event
By Tracy Maness

Communities of color are less likely to seek care for mental health issues for different reasons, said Mychal Riley, licensed clinical social worker at The Menninger Clinic.
Since July is Minority Mental Health Month, The Menninger Clinic and The Health Museum are hosting a free virtual program to help parents and caregivers navigate addressing mental health needs for their children and themselves. The program will be held from noon to 1 p.m. on Thursday, July 22, and is part of the “Parents, Let’s Talk Mental Health” series.
According to nonprofit Mental Health America, approximately 17 percent of Black Americans, 15 percent of Latinx/Hispanic Americans, 13 percent of Asian Americans and 23 percent of native Americans/indigenous communities grapple with mental illness.
“Despite these numbers, many BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) community members will face stigma, discrimination and barriers to access that may inhibit or deter their ability or desire to seek help,” Riley said. “By talking openly about mental health, we then can begin to address the stigma and barriers.”
He explained that while minorities do not fundamentally differ in their mental health from other communities, the issues can be more complicated through the lens of their identity in society. A person of color, for example, can grow depressed or anxious over feeling isolated from a community, which can then be compounded by hearing from others that those feelings make them weak.
Riley added that a person who is unable to find a therapist who they believe understands how the cultural stressors impact mental health, they may see it as difficult to employ or trust the therapist’s help. But sometimes health concerns, Riley said, come from “direct result of an impact from their identity,” like surviving an identity-related trauma.
The free program will help to promote awareness, which Riley said aids in starting to break down mental health stigma that makes it more difficult for communities of color to look for care and help.
“The session aims to help parents better understand how to think about mental health and mental illness with their children, signs to look for that your child may be struggling, ways to identify support for them and ways to talk to them about mental health and the world,” Riley said.
The Menninger Clinic is regarded as one of the top psychiatric hospitals in the United States, with more than 95 years of addressing mental illness. The Health Museum works to encourage interest in health, medical science and the human body and has welcomed more than 3 million visitors since its start in 1969.

Former Houstonian Zach Person helps lead Austin’s guitar-rock revival
By Hector Saldaña

Black Pumas were just the beginning. Fresh faces are rejuvenating Austin’s music scene, mashing up genres effortlessly and even rudely.
It’s a next frontier of sound and attitudes in the home of the armadillo, a tapestry of pummeling blues rock and soul soaked in distorted electronics, ambient fuzz, funkier beats, politics and identity.
Some of the acts to watch for are Zach Person, Emily Wolfe, Jackie Venson, Gina Chavez and Sam Houston & Blk Odyssy.
“I feel like there’s a new wave of music happening right now,” said Person, 24, who moved to Austin from Houston. The former “American Idol” contestant, who returns home Aug. 13 to play House of Blues, released his self-titled debut album in April.
There are echoes of recent Austin rock gods — blues-rock guitarist Gary Clark Jr. and rock act Spoon — recast with innovations from the indie rock, synth-soul, hip-hop, soul and Latin music world. The sonic building blocks owe a debt to the minimalism of the White Stripes and Black Keys.
Person and Wolfe are even being hailed as new guitar heroes.
Onstage, with drummer Jake Wyble triggering the wilder synth and ambient electronic sounds, Person hammers home killer tracks like “Can’t Stop Running,” “Send Me Away” and “How Long.”
It’s not about being a purist, said Person, who can coo like Leon Bridges and Prince and roar like Jimi Hendrix.
“Blues music is the foundation of what I do,” he said. “But it is really cool to see all the young acts that are pushing blues forward and putting a spin on it.”
Austin rock is receiving kudos beyond nightclub and festival stages. Anyone tuning into the Grammy Awards this year saw the music capital’s impact.
Black Pumas’ self-titled album was nominated for album of the year, and the band’s song “Colors” was up for record of the year.
These youngish musicians all say they are part of a generational change but also part of a continuum. They revere Austin icons Willie Nelson and Stevie Ray Vaughan but incorporate their own sounds, styles and viewpoints.
Wolfe, who is becoming known for the aggressive music she makes on her Epiphone electric guitar, is celebrating brand-new album “Outlier,” which was written and recorded during the pandemic.
“I felt really free writing this record. I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself into any kind of blues-rock,” she said. “I really wanted to break the boundary of genre. You’ll hear everything from super-intense rock riffs to great pop stuff.”
“I do feel like I’m a part of (the Austin rock wave). For the longest time, I didn’t,” she said. “I kind of hope it’s like this renaissance like when Stevie Ray Vaughan was coming up. I think it’d be really cool if there was a wave.”
Guitar rock is well-suited, Wolfe said, for these isolated times “where all over the world they’re grabbing guitars.”
It’s cathartic to play and hear rock music — for players and audiences.
“I think especially with the pandemic and locking everybody in, there’s this pent-up tension,” she said. “And tension is inherent in rock, and having rock bands in front of you is therapeutic in some ways,” she said.
Austin’s music scene has always been about more than legends like Nelson and Vaughan, said Latin Grammy nominee Gina Chavez, 39, who just released a wild new track, “Pitaya Roja,” featuring Mexico’s Mexican Institute of Sound.
“They put Austin on the map, but the new rising stars have way more to offer. There have always been fresh faces but we are living in a new time,” said Chavez, who identifies as a queer Latinx artist. “It’s long been time for new heroes who look different. It’s about making space for new voices. (But) it’s hard to break through and establish a new paradigm.”
Another upcoming Austin musician challenging conventions and incorporating politics in her music is Venson, 31, considered one of the city’s best blues guitarists.
She made her debut on “Austin City Limits” last year dressed in a provocative outfit sporting the names of Black people killed during encounters with police. She tweeted about her fashion statement last October: “Black Lives Matter. It’s not just a slogan or a hashtag to me, it’s my family, it’s my friends, it’s real people with real lives.”
Her latest studio album is “Vintage Machine.”
While these new guitar acts are definitely making noise, not everyone is hearing it.
“I’m not sure I’m spotting enough new rock to call it a trend,” Jeff McCord, music editor at KUTX 98.9 in Austin and on-air host of “What’s Next,” said via email. “Zach and Jackie spring from the Austin blues-rock world, and there’s a hunger for that from older audiences. But it doesn’t interest a lot of younger fans.”
Person concedes the blues rock he plays wasn’t big with a lot of the kids at Bush High School in Richmond.
“It wasn’t cool,” he said. “Hip-hop was most prevalent.”
It’s not so different in Austin: “College kids, their ears are more attuned to more indie sounds, but there is still an element of hip-hop and really produced radio music is popular.”
According to McCord, a lot of Austin’s “most interesting music is coming from the hip-hop and soul scene.”
Sam Houston, who fronts Blk Odyssy, is part of that scene.
“Our music is Black. Whether it’s rock, hip-hop or soul, it’s Black,” said Houston, 24, whose music ranges from mysterious and raw to soulfully sweet. It also rocks.
“My objective in the rock scene here was to offer a gateway into the vibrant soul scene, to introduce the fans to something new,” Houston said.
Wolfe agrees that it’s important to not be tied to convention while paving new trails.
“As a gay woman, I feel like an outlier in the world a lot of times,” she said. “I think I want people to take away (from my album) that it’s OK to be that, to be an outlier, to feel different and not fit into a box.”"

87 percent of orthopedic surgeons are white. This Baylor doctor is working to diversify his field
By Julie Garcia

No one would make eye contact with Dr. Brian Nwannunu.
“A few of my rotations, the general culture and underlying message was, ‘We don’t want anyone that doesn’t look like us,’” said Nwannunu, an adult-reconstruction fellow in orthopedics at Baylor College of Medicine. “They don’t feel like they can relate to you. They would shun me. Active teaching residents wouldn’t look at me and only talk to other students. I knew I wasn’t wanted.”
Nwannunu, 34, has wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon since he injured his ankle playing basketball in high school. He remembers eyeing the sports memorabilia on the wall and thinking how different the orthopedist’s office was compared to his pediatrician’s. His interest was piqued.
While the Dallas native was navigating internships during his time at Howard University and Georgetown University, he felt his experience of being “othered” wasn’t isolated only to him. Throughout his residencies, he worked with practicing orthopedic surgeons who said they wanted to promote diversity and inclusion. But they were all white and all male, he remembered.
“When you talk to them, it was evident they didn’t want someone here who was different,” he said. “It’s not that we’re not applying.”
After Nwannunu’s Baylor fellowship ends, he will move to Dallas to join a private practice with five other orthopedic surgeons. He’s excited to be part of a practice that celebrates diversity.
“Multiple people come up to me and say I’m the first Black doctor they’ve ever seen,” said Nwannunu, a first-generation Nigerian American. “They said they don’t trust the older, white guy, but they trust me to do their surgery. That’s the type of difference that can be made when the career of orthopedics is diverse.”
COVID-19’s devastation in Black and Latino populations has shed more light on the realities of deeply entrenched health disparities for U.S. communities of color. For Dr. Melvyn Harrington, the pandemic has shown the importance of minority representation in doctors’ offices and hospitals so patients of color can establish trust more easily.
The key is getting the medical students interested in the field early, he said. And that’s not easy.
In 2019, Harrington, a professor of orthopedic surgery and adult-reconstruction director at Baylor, co-wrote a paper on the lack of gender and racial diversity in his field. The 53-year-old surgeon said there’s a great need for the orthopedic workforce to be as a diverse as the patients it serves.
Harrington said orthopedics is “far and away” the least diverse field in terms of race, ethnicity and gender, but there’s no single reason.
The lack of diversity is evident in other surgical fields as well. In 2020, the American Society for Plastic Surgeons reported that there has been an increase of 0.3 percent of Black plastic surgeons in the previous 12 years and only 1.7 percent more plastic surgeons who identify as Latinx.
“It would take more than 8,013 and 863 years for Black and Latinx Americans, respectively, to attain parity in plastic surgery,” the society reported.
According to a 2018 Association of American Medical Colleges report, 56.2 percent of all physicians, regardless of specialty, in the U.S. were white. Asian Americans make up the second-largest group at only 17 percent, Hispanic people make up 5.8 percent, and Black people account for 5.3 percent of doctors.
“A lot of it is these stereotypes of orthopedic surgeons is we’re ‘strong as an ox and half as smart,’” Harrington said. “A lot of them are ex-jocks, and the perception is you have to be a big, strong guy to be able to do the procedures. It’s really misinformation.”
In “The Orthopaedic Workforce Is Not as Diverse as the Population It Serves: Where Are the Minorities and the Women?,” Harrington and three researchers found that while current medical school classes are split evenly — with women leading men in 2017 and 2020 — the percentage of women in orthopedic surgery residencies has remained at 14 percent since 2009.
Though the overall number of women in orthopedics has doubled since 1995, there has been only a “modest increase” in the numbers of Black, Asian American and Latino orthopedic residents, according to Harrington’s paper.
The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons did not address race in its field surveys until 2004, according to Harrington’s research. At that time, 89 percent of orthopedic surgeons identified as Caucasian, and 9 percent were from a minority race; Asian American members have the highest minority representation in the academy.
By 2016, 86.6 percent of orthopedic surgeons identified as Caucasian and 6.7 percent were Asian American. Less than 2 percent were Hispanic or Black or multiracial.
“There’s been definitely some inherent bias against underrepresented students and women in programs over the years,” Harrington said. “Programs will not hire a woman because they might get pregnant and need to take time off. It’s been a very stereotypical old boys club, locker-room culture.”
Within orthopedics, sports medicine is the fastest-growing specialty in medicine. But the number of women and people of color in sports-medicine residencies has remained small, too.
Since 2004, Harrington has worked with Nth Dimensions, a program that serves as a pipeline for underrepresented medical school students to orthopedic residencies. The program’s goals include addressing and eliminating health care disparities for all communities through summer internships, mentoring and project-based education.
“It’s really lack of early exposure, which is one of the challenges all subspecialties face,” he said. “The stereotypical route to orthopedic surgery that a lot of guys have is, ‘I tore my ACL playing football in high school and fell in love with orthopedics.’”
Early in medical school, orthopedics is offered as elective courses, and many students don’t have the chance to take their first class until their third year, when it’s time to choose a specialty, Harrington said.
More than 30 percent of practicing orthopedic surgeons who identify as female are products of the Nth Dimensions Pipeline Curriculum program, according to Harrington’s paper. More than 65 percent of those women identify as minorities.
Each summer, Harrington mentors a first-year student — either a woman or person of color — from another medical school. This year’s intern, Olaoluwa Omotowa, has shadowed Harrington and Nwannunu at Baylor’s orthopedic clinics, and he will finish a research project in early August.
Omotowa, 28, is in his first year of medical school at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he is one of a few Black students. After expressing an interest in orthopedic surgery, a colleague recommended he look into an internship at Nth Dimensions.
In 2020, AAMC reported less than 3 percent of American doctors are Black men. Omotowa, also Nigerian American, wants to be part of the first large generation of Black male physicians.
Omotowa is one of 43 orthopedic surgery interns matched with residency programs through Nth Dimensions. Though he doesn’t have to declare a specialty until his third year, he likely will stay in orthopedics.
“I’m the first person in my family to go to medical school, and I’ll be the first physician in my family,” Omotowa said. “It’s a challenge being the first anything and navigating it without anyone else in my immediate family not going through it; after all the experiences I’ve had this summer, it’s hard to envision doing anything else.”
Though he didn’t know it nine years ago, Nwannunu’s entire career path changed when he started working with Nth Dimensions. For him, the program was about representation and seeing in person what he never saw growing up — Black doctors treating patients of all races and backgrounds.
Since he’s been in Houston this summer, he has worked with patients from diverse backgrounds. But he still doesn’t see many people of color in clinician roles, especially in orthopedics. He says he’s lucky to have had a chance injury as a high school athlete, which put him on this career path. But many Black men don’t have that same exposure.
Though the field has diversified slightly since Harrington started 30 years ago, he said the number of new orthopedic surgeons from underrepresented backgrounds does not match the increasing number of procedures they have to perform. Since the American population is aging, there is a need for more orthopedic surgeries as baby boomers try to remain active.
“The challenge in medical school is exposure and getting them early on,” Harrington said. “Orthopedics is the most competitive specialty for students to get into. Our challenge is trying to make it more diverse, too.”"

Pitts: Skepticism can make you blind
By Leonard Pitts Jr.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 12: Larry Green (R) receives his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine from registered nurse Teresa Frey at Lincoln Memorial Congregational Church UCC on March 12, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. The Providence health organization pop-up vaccine clinic was held at the predominantly Black church as part of their health equity campaign in communities of color. The current COVID-19 death rate for Black people is 10 percent higher than the state average while the death rate for Latinx people is 21 percent higher. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)
They told them they had bad blood.
What they actually had was syphilis, but the U.S. Public Health Service never shared that diagnosis with the almost 400 African American men, most of them poor and undereducated sharecroppers, they recruited for a secret study at Tuskegee Institute in 1932. Indeed, health officials did little for those men for 40 years, except watch the progression of the disease.
That was the goal of the study: to see what happens when syphilis is left unchecked. And they did see. Syphilis is a venereal disease that can lead to paralysis, blindness, deafness, dementia, heart trouble, brain damage and death.
People often point to the so-called Tuskegee Experiment to explain why African Americans tend to mistrust the medical establishment, but while what happened in Alabama was obscene, it was hardly unique. To the contrary, from experimental procedures on the vaginas of enslaved women to grave robbers stealing Black bodies for use in medical schools, to forced sterilization in the name of eugenics, to studies revealing that white doctors think Black people feel less pain, to new mother Serena Williams having to battle doctors and nurses who ignored her as she suffered a life-threatening medical emergency, Black people have been routinely betrayed by this profession whose prime directive is, “First, do no harm.” So the mistrust is grounded in hard experience.
I can speak to this at firsthand. In recent years, I’ve lost a brother-in-law and a cousin after they declined to follow medical advice. Another brother-in-law has heart issues — and trusts his doctors about like he would a $4 bill.
I also have two sons and a grandson who refuse to take the COVID vaccine. I am scared to death for them.
Most of the public discussion of vaccine hesitancy is dominated by Republicans behaving badly, the clownish people who think vaccines will magnetize them or let Bill Gates track their movements. But beyond political party, race (along with age) has emerged as a major predictor of skepticism. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that less than half of Black and Hispanic adults have been fully vaccinated, compared with well over 60 percent of white ones. And mistrust is a major reason, though not the only reason, for that disparity.
My boys and I, we do this dance. They give me their reasons for not getting the shot, I give them rebuttals.
It was developed too fast, they say. It’s called an emergency, I say; you get out of the house faster when it’s burning.
I don’t know what’s in it, they say. You don’t know what’s in Cheez Whiz, I say, but that doesn’t stop you from eating it.
There may be side effects to taking it, they say. Well, the side effect to not taking it could be death.
They nod and promise to think about it, but they don’t. It’s just a dance we do.
And while we dance, 616,000 Americans lie dead, a disproportionate number of them people of color.
There’s nothing wrong with skepticism. Skepticism can be healthy, can even save your life. But skepticism can also make you blind. So this is me begging my sons and all our sons and daughters: Just take the damn shot.
Look around. People who’ve done that are not dying. People who haven’t are. That’s a fact. Please don’t be so skeptical that you can’t see what might save your life. I’m not asking you to trust your doctor.
I am asking you to trust your eyes."

Stage set for redistricting fight as Texas adds 4 million people in census count
By Sam González Kelly

When the U.S. Census Bureau released their decennial statistics on the nation’s population last week, it marked the first step in what is likely to be a long, drawn out battle among lawmakers and voting advocates on how state and federal voting districts will be divvied up in Texas and around the country.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long used the redistricting process — which occurs every 10 years and uses census data as its basis — to draw convoluted, tangled districts that favor them politically and increase their chances of remaining in office, a practice called “gerrymandering.”
Though the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlaws explicitly discriminatory voting practices, redistricting often falls along racial lines anyway, as people of color are more likely to vote Democrat. In a state like Texas, where Republicans control the state House and Senate, as well as the governor’s office, that means that Black and brown residents get shortchanged at the ballot box, advocates say.
“Redistricting goes hand in hand with gerrymandering in this state, specifically racial gerrymandering where some of the worst lines are drawn to dilute the voting power of people of color,” said Miguel Rivera, voting rights outreach coordinator for the Texas Civil Rights Project.
The last time the Republican-led state legislature redrew political maps, after the 2010 census, it set off a flurry of lawsuits from Democrats and advocacy groups that lasted through three election cycles. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually decided that partisan gerrymandering is beyond the scope of their authority, and upheld the practice as long as it wasn’t explicitly done on the basis of race.
“For someone who might bring a lawsuit, the issue is proving that [race] was the rationale with drawing the lines,” said Texas Demographer Lloyd Potter. “It becomes pretty ambiguous between party- and racial-based gerrymandering, because minority status tends to align by party.”
Federal laws around redistricting are loose enough that the only enforceable criteria is that each district has roughly the same amount of people. On a national level, Texas, which gained two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives following the 2020 census, will divide its population of 29,145,505 people by the 38 districts it was allotted to create districts of about 766,987 people each.
The lax restrictions around gerrymandering allow lawmakers to essentially choose their constituents, meaning some voters can have their voices drowned out by residents of communities that look nothing like theirs, though they share a representative. It also leaves little incentive for a representative to listen to some voters’ concerns, if the majority of their bloc is living in another community altogether and may have different agendas.
“[A fair redistricting process] has never really been defined, and that’s where the whole gerrymandering process comes from, because no one said ‘You can’t do this,’” Potter said.
“It’s not just in Texas, it happens everywhere, and if the Democrats were in power they would be doing the same thing,” Potter said. “From the perspective of objective representation, it’s a bit inconsistent… with the democratic principles of true representation and having civil discourse.”
This time around in Texas, the stakes are even higher, advocates say, as the state is no longer subject to civil rights-era restrictions that mandated federal officials sign off on any newly drawn maps. The restrictions had been in place for Texas and other states with segregationist pasts since the Voting Rights Act was signed in 1965, and were only lifted in 2013 after the Supreme Court ruled preclearance requirements unconstitutional.
“Without the protection of the Voting Rights Act, we know we’re walking into a process that Texas has historically weaponized against communities of color, but this time without these very important federal protections,” Rivera said.
As people of color drive Texas’ growth, making up 95% of the roughly 4 million new residents the state added in the last decade, advocates say there are ways to overhaul the redistricting process to more accurately reflect the changing demographics.
An independent citizens’ redistricting commission, for example, could take the redistricting process out of lawmakers’ hands and entrust it to a bipartisan, civilian taskforce. Several states and municipalities across the country, including Austin, have already adopted such measures.
“We’ve been working for a long time to get these common sense policy solutions passed. We’ve been trying to get an independent citizen’s redistricting commission passed for a long time,” said Stephanie Gómez, associate director at Common Cause Texas. “Rep. Mary González, D-El Paso, introduced a bill this past session and it didn’t go anywhere because, for the people currently in power, it doesn’t serve their interest to form an independent commission.”
State records show González’s bill was left pending in the House Redistricting Committee in April.
“We always say redistricting is democracy in action, and as you see in Texas, power-hungry politicians draw voting district maps that benefit their interests, rather than allowing their every community has the opportunity to share their lived experience,” Gomez said.
“You look at the racial demographics of the Texas Legislature, and it doesn’t reflect the makeup of white, Latinx, Black and Asian and other Texans. Redistricting works best when mapmakers draw districts in a transparent, fair and inclusive process that prioritizes communities that have been historically left out of the process,” Gomez said.
In Texas, Latinos make up 40% of the state’s population, census data shows, but just 25% of the Legislature, according to the Mexican American Legislative Caucus.
“We call upon the better angels of our colleagues in the Legislature to embrace diversity as a strength and commit to drawing electoral maps that are representative of our great state. Together, we can make the promise of democracy real for all of us,” said State Rep. Rafael Anchía, chair of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and member of the House Committee on Redistricting.
Texas Republicans did not respond to a request for comment on allegations that the redistricting process undercuts the voting power of Black and brown residents.
“We expect redistricting to be complete this year. We also expect each State House district to have approximately 194,000 people, Senate districts to have 940,000 people, and Congressional districts to have 767,000 people. We know for certain there will be 150 State House districts, 31 State Senate districts, and 38 Congressional districts,” Matt Rinaldi, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, said in a statement."

Despite ongoing debate over transgender rights, Black and brown leaders continue to care for Houston’s trans communities
By Sam González Kelly

When the Legislature convenes Monday for its third special session, the main order of business is redrawing the state’s political boundaries for the next decade’s worth of elections.
But tucked into Gov. Greg Abbott’s agenda, again, is a bill that would bar transgender children from playing in school sports that align with their gender identity. Sen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, says his bill — which already failed to pass during the 87th legislative session and the two special sessions that followed — is about protecting competitive balance for cisgender girls, or those whose gender identity matches the one they were assigned at birth.
It is just the latest in a history of attempts to curtail the rights of transgender Texans, but for longtime advocates in Houston’s transgender community, it only reinforces their conviction in their causes and each other.
Earlier this summer, Abbott successfuly pushed to have gender-affirming surgery for children redefined as “genital mutilation,” a characterization that goes against the longstanding wisdom of medical professionals. In 2015, Houston voters struck down the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance — which protected marginalized groups including transgender people from discrimination — after opponents stoked fears of transgender women using women’s restrooms.
Neither Abbott nor Perry’s offices returned requests for comment.
For transgender people in Houston, and especially people of color, the political attacks mean many have had to take matters into their own hands to keep themselves and their communities safe. Some choose to take their fight to lawmakers, while other tune out the political noise and focus on what they can do to help each other.
“When people say I’m a trans advocate, I’m actually a human rights advocate. It just so happens that I’m trans and that population needs attention, and I have some privilege in that space to use my voice,” said Atlantis Narcisse, founder of Save Our Sisters United.
Narcisse is one of many organizers in Houston working to support transgender people of color by providing them financial resources, health care guidance and safe spaces to mingle and build community. Save Our Sisters United was able to dole out over $3,700 in gift cards to women and transgender people of color last spring following the February freeze, and in preparation for hurricane season.
Monetary assistance is only one of the ways advocacy groups in Houston provide for one another. Groups including Save Our Sisters United and The Mahogany Project, another nonprofit that focuses on Black transgender people, direct people to resources for getting their names changed and gender-affirming surgery.
The Organización Latina de Trans en Tejas holds monthly food drives for transgender people, information sessions for immigrants and support group meetings and spiritual healing sessions. Elia Chino, founder of the Fundación Latinoamericana de Acción Social, started her organization in the 1990s to provide education and resources to those affected by the AIDS crisis.
Though these spaces have now become vital points for the transgender community to celebrate each other, some, like the Fundación, were born of tragedy. The Mahogany Project was formed in 2017 when Chyna Gibson, a Black transgender woman and popular ballroom performer, was fatally shot in New Orleans.
In Texas, at least 14 transgender people were killed between 2017 and 2020, eight of whom were Black and four of whom were Latinx, according to the Transgender Law Center. That’s about 10 percent of the 139 transgender people who were killed nationwide in that time; Texas has just under 9 percent of the U.S. population.
“I’ve been working within trans communities for the last four years, and in that time I’ve watched Texas become the trans murder capital of the United State. I’ve watched year over year a record number of trans individuals being killed, and most of them being Black women,” said Verniss McFarland, founder of The Mahogany Project.
“I’ve watched politicians take personal attacks against trans youth, trans individuals and other gender-expansive individuals as it relates to health care, housing, jobs and just basic civil liberties,” McFarland said.
Advocates say that while an increase in awareness and education about transgender people has led to some positive shifts, such as more people having their names changed and pronouns used correctly, it’s also led to an increase in attacks from people looking to use transgender people as a scapegoat for societal ills.
“Everybody needs somebody to blame when things aren’t going right,” McFarland said.
“America has a long history of being homophobic and transphobic, so if we can turn away from the Jan. 6 insurrection and say ‘Well hey, lets put the lens on trans people playing sports,’ then people start to forget that people tried to tear up the Capitol … because now our common enemy is the trans people out here getting sex changes, asking to use the restroom, playing sports and asking to vote,” McFarland said.
Trans people also worry about the effects that having their existence constantly politicized can have on mental health. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that about 40 percent of transgender adults reported attempting suicide at some point in their lives.
“One of the fears that comes with all of these attacks is the increase in suicides, and just the need of mental healthcare,” said Dee Dee Watters, publisher of TransGriot. “It changes the narrative of a lot of things, and sometimes people don’t even notice what’s going on, but the more they attack our rights — and you see this with abortion — these things happen when you get a lot of people involved and worked up about a specific topic.”
Watters took over TransGriot after founder Monica Roberts died in October. The blog is centered around the experiences of Black trans women, and Watters says she’s in the process of hiring staff members to take the publication to a larger platform.
“TransGriot is something Monica decided to start because she was noticing that there wasn’t any coverage of people that looked like her or even had a similar experience,” Watters said. “Monica wanted to start contributing things and putting things out there for people who looked like her.”
“My goal is to give a space for those voices to be heard. I’m not a journalist and not looking to become one, I’m just looking to take TransGriot and create space for people who want to do that,” Watters said.
The Mahogany Project, meanwhile, is planning for its fourth annual Black Trans Empowerment Week in November, which will include resource fairs and social events like mixers and movie nights, as well as awards for members of the community.
“It’s a week where we get to pay homage and honor trans individuals lives and legacies and their direct work within the community,” McFarland said. “While we pay homage to some of our ancestors who are trans-visible who we have lost over the past year, we also recognize it’s important to give individuals who are still living their flowers now.”
Advocates say they can only do so much to keep each other safe. They are asking legislators to pass laws such as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance that will put protections in writing, instead of pushing legislation that will further harm transgender people.
When the “bathroom bill” was under debate in 2017, Ana Andrea Molina, founder of Organización Latina de Trans en Tejas, testified before the Texas Senate, as did Monica Roberts, and the bill was eventually defeated. Emmett Schelling, a Korean American transgender man and executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, often testifies when legislation targeting transgender people is up for debate in the statehouse.
“We need to have laws that protect us. We live in a world that is full of violence and discrimination against the trans community, and this has to stop. That is priority No. 1,” said Chino, founder of Fundación Latinoamericana de Acción Social.
“What is it that our allies and others who are supposedly in agreement with us doing? Houston doesn’t even have an equal rights ordinance because of us,” Watters said. “Some people say that (anti-trans) people are doing this because they’re uneducated, but I’m not sure I can agree with that. You shouldn’t be able to hold a certain position and not know to take care of your constituents. If you can’t do that you shouldn’t take on the position, and not only that, but how dare you speak on things that you’re not educated on?”"

Exclusive Q&A: Actress Gabrielle Union on family, infidelity and finding joy in her new book
By Joy Sewing

Gabrielle Union has found freedom in speaking up.
In her new book, “You Got Anything Stronger?,” she takes on tough, personal subjects, including racial prejudice in Hollywood, depression and infertility, which led to surrogacy. She even reveals how she forgave husband and former NBA player Dwyane Wade after he fathered a child with another woman. It’s a follow-up to her 2017 bestselling memoir, “We’re Going to Need More Wine,” which was a collection of essays on her Nebraska childhood, including a powerful account of being raped at gunpoint in college.
At 48, Union has learned the power of her voice and being vulnerable, she said. She’ll be in Houston on Friday for a sold-out talk about her book at the Fountain of Praise church with pastor Mia Wright. The event is presented by Houston bookstore Kindred Stories and Metamorphosis Conference.
“I really fought to add a Texas date to the book tour, and there was some pushback,” she said. “I thought it was really important. And you guys, I mean, you made me look like Yoda, so I do appreciate the support.”
Union, who married Wade in 2014, began her acting career in the 1990s on sitcoms and had a breakout movie role in “Bring It On” in 2000. She’s written two children’s books, has a hair care line, Flawless by Gabrielle Union, and production company, I’ll Have Another Productions, which is developing the bestselling memoir “All Boys Aren’t Blue” by George M. Johnson into a TV series.
She talked with the Houston Chronicle about her new book, motherhood and finding her own voice.
Q: Why did you want to write another book?
A: I had a lot more to say. I had experienced a lot more that I definitely knew I needed to share and wanted to share. I was healed enough to speak about it in an effective, impactful way. After this pandemic and everyone being so isolated, I knew that now was the time to write the follow-up, and help to try to just create more community by sharing some of my life’s challenges and joys, and hope to allow other people to see themselves reflected on the page.
Q: Was the writing process easier this time?
A: It was easier because I was less afraid. I wasn’t bound by the same fears as the first one. I wasn’t so motivated by the reaction, I was motivated by the truth and radical transparency.
Q: How has motherhood changed your outlook on life?
A: As a mom raising two daughters, I want to raise black girls to de-center white comfort and de-center the needs of patriarchy and toxic masculinity, to ask who would you be, what kind of dreams would you have if you divested from those things. To me, that’s freedom. As a mom who so desperately wants that for my daughters, I realized that maybe I should start with myself. So I’m hoping to inspire more people to find what freedom means to them, and to seek it out and to live it.
Q: On social media, you make motherhood look so fun. Are you having as much fun as it seems?
A: I’m very privileged and lucky that I have really fun and funny kids. They’re just not that challenging every day, all day. I also have a lot of help. So things might not have been fun if I was just by myself or feeling like I was underwater, but with a ton of help, a very large village and having my family close by and in the house, it allows me to find some humor in some parts of parenting that I probably would not find funny at all if I was by myself.
Q: Why is it important for you to speak out about issues such as racism in Hollywood and women’s rights?
A: There continues to be so much to fight back against, so much to push back against, so much to uncover and shine a light on and expose. In order to move forward, you have to look back and to be accountable … But first, we have to address the actual harm caused, and that takes people speaking up. And I don’t mind being outspoken, and I just hope that it inspires more and more people to join the fight.
Q: Do you think things will change?
A: If enough of us speak up and band together, if we all step up together, they can’t take us all out. And that is the only way that there’s going to be any sort of noticeable change. We’re still so geeked on celebrating the first Black woman this, the first Asian woman that or the first Latinx man. That causes me shame. I cringe. In 2021, we’re still having firsts. We all need to rush forward and say, ‘No, one is not enough.’ And we’re not taking it anymore, and this younger generation is certainly not taking it. The demand for real change, significant change, tangible change, is now.
Q: What keeps you up at night?
A: The Texas abortion ban. It’s like something out of the “Handmaid’s Tale.” It’s illogical. It’s not based in science, and it sends everybody backward. Under the guise of being pro-family, it’s frightening. And now it’s the blueprint for a number of other states, and it keeps me up at night.
Q: Are there any roles you won’t take?
A: I don’t tend to be offered problematic roles, where people would have strong negative opinions. For whatever reason, I’m just not really ever put in that position … At this stage of the game, it’s more of like, how comfortable am I with, say, nudity?
Q: Does nudity for an acting role bother you?
A: I don’t generally have an issue with nudity. In real life, we’re naked. There are lot of things that other people might find offensive or uncomfortable that aren’t even a thing to me, like exploring sexuality and nudity, or some more controversial topics. I know some people are like, “But you are a mother now, what would your daughter think?” And I’m like, I hope my daughter knows that adults have sex.
Q: You looked fabulous at the recent Met Gala. Did you have a good time?
A: This year’s Met Gala was a little different for a thousand reasons, and I was alone. I didn’t have a date. I wasn’t physically with a friend or the designer (Dutch designer Iris van Herpen), who wasn’t able to travel from her country with our country’s COVID travel issues. So, it was kind of a more solitary experience, and I’ve never really experienced Met in this sort of way. I had a lot of fun after, getting to hang out with Regina King and Queen Latifah, and going to Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz’s party and eating pizza, chilling. That was very fun, that was a lot of fun.
Q: What is something surprising about you?
A: I’m not just one thing. I think for some people, they’re like, “She’s this advocate. She’s a rabble-rouser. She’s a basketball wife, or she’s whatever.” But I think people would be surprised that I have a lot of joy and laughs in my life. That I’m funny. That there’s a lot of joy in the book, and it’s not just heavy topics. So they can see a bit more of the fullness of my life, not just one part.
Q: Are you a jokester at home?
A: I’m a great storyteller. Not jokes, per se. I’m a funny commentator about most things, but I leave the jokes to the comedians.
Q: What brings you joy?
A: My family. Watching my family achieve their dreams, and live the dream and be free. And to feel so loved and supported by them brings me a lot of joy."

You must see this beautiful children’s book about Selena
By Joey Guerra

The story of Selena continues to be told in new and exciting ways.
""Queen of Tejano Music: Selena"" is a children's book that manages a fresh spin on the now-familiar stories about the Tejano singer. It includes beautiful illustrations by Paola Escobar, a Colombian graphic designer and illustrator; and words by Silvia Lopez, who has worked as a children's librarian for more than three decades.
Lopez was familiar with Selena before writing the book but didn't truly recognize the singer's impact until she began prepping for the book.
""As soon as I began researching -- reading books and countless articles and watching videos of interviews and performances -- I immediately understood that devotion. Selena was not only a terrifically talented entertainer. She was a warm and gracious human being. Her genuineness shone through in her interviews just like the love of her art came across in her music,"" Lopez says.
""Queen of Tejano Music"" traces Selena's beginnings in Lake Jackson and tells how her name was a last-minute choice because her parents were expecting a boy. It details her rise to fame, challenges with learning Spanish and breakthrough outside of Texas. The book also touches on Selena's struggles as a woman in a musical genre that wasn't always welcoming and sacrificing her childhood for that career.
""I wanted children to see Selena as an example of perseverance, to know that working hard and setting goals go hand in hand with having talent when striving for success,"" Lopez says. ""I wanted them to understand that Selena’s rise to stardom was not always easy, that she overcame obstacles and setbacks, and that there were things she gave up.""
The book includes an illustrated timeline of Selena's life and career. There's also an illustrated glossary of key terms, including ""Tejanos,"" ""Hispanics or Latinos"" and ""Tejano or Tex-Mex Music.""
Lopez does include Selena's death in the book. But it's ultimately a celebration of a woman who continues to inspire and entertain.
""Selena broke many barriers on many fronts. She was a trailblazer, opening doors not only for women in the world of Tejano music, but for herself and other Latinx performers in the realm of mainstream American music and the performing arts,"" Lopez says. ""In Selena, young Latinas could see themselves, accepted for who they were. She was also as ultimately American as any kid anywhere in the United States who dares to dream big dreams."""

Douthat: How Democrats can save themselves
By Ross Douthat The New York Times

Normally the political party that loses an election goes through a period of soul-searching and vigorous internal debate, while the winning party embraces a smug certainty about its own inevitable multigenerational dominance. In 2021, though, the roles are reversed.
The widespread belief that Donald Trump was, in some sense, the real winner of an election that he lost has succeeded in preempting a Republican debate about why the Democrats captured the White House last year. Meanwhile, the Democrats, despite their control of the Congress and the presidency, are increasingly the ones arguing as though they’re already in the wilderness.
The Democrats’ angst strikes me as a healthy development for liberalism. One problem with the emergency thinking that Trump inspires in his opponents — and one reason to resist it — is that it occludes real understanding of the political conditions that put him in power, and that might do so again. This is what you saw happen to the Democrats after 2016: The sense of being lightning-struck sent the center-left wandering into a maze of conspiracies, a haunted wood where villains like Vladimir Putin and Mark Zuckerberg loomed larger than the swing voters they had lost and savior figures like Robert Mueller were supposed to unmake Trump’s power for them.
Now, with the increasing awareness that Bidenism is probably not a long-term strategy, we’re finally getting the fuller argument that should have broken out after 2016 — over what the Democrats can do, and whether they can do anything, to win over the working-class and rural voters alienated by the party’s increasingly rigorous progressive litmus tests.
A key player in this argument is the pollster and analyst David Shor who has emerged — after a temporary 2020 cancellation — as the leading spokesman for the pragmatic liberal critique of progressive zeal.
His critique starts with a diagnosis: Democrats misread the meaning of Barack Obama’s 2012 victory, imagining that it proved that their multiracial coalition could win without downscale and rural white voters, when in fact Obama had beaten Mitt Romney precisely because of his relatively resilient support from those demographics, especially across the industrial Midwest. And this misreading was particularly disastrous because these voters have outsize influence in Senate races and the Electoral College, so losing them — and then beginning to lose culturally conservative minority voters as well — has left the Democrats with a structural disadvantage that will cost them dearly across the next decade absent some kind of clear strategic adjustment.
From this diagnosis comes the prescription, so-called popularism: Where left-wing ideas are popular, Shor Thought would have Democrats talk about them more. But where they are unpopular, especially with the kind of voters who hold the key to contested Senate races, Democrats need a way to defuse them or hold them at a distance.
Thus a “popularist” candidate might be a thoroughgoing centrist in some cases, and in others a candidate running the way Bernie Sanders did in 2016, stressing the most popular ideas in the social-democratic tool kit. But in both cases such candidates would do everything in their power not to be associated with ideas like, say, police abolition or the suspension of immigration enforcement. Instead they would imitate the way Obama himself, in his first term, tried to finesse issues like immigration and same-sex marriage, sometimes using objectively conservative rhetoric and never getting way out ahead of public opinion.
Which is easier said than done. For one thing, the Democratic Party’s activists have a different scale of power in the world of 2021 than the world of 2011, and the hypothetical “popularist” politician can’t make their influence and expectations just go away.
At the very least a Democratic strategy along these lines would probably need to go further along two dimensions. First, it would need to overtly attack the new progressivism — not on every front but on certain points where the language and ideas of the progressive clerisy are particularly alienated from ordinary life.
For instance, popularist Democrats would not merely avoid a term like “Latinx,” which is ubiquitous in official progressive discourse and alien to most U.S. Hispanics; they would need to attack and even mock its use. (Obviously this is somewhat easier for the ideal popularist candidate: an unwoke minority politician in the style of Eric Adams.)
Instead of reducing the salience of progressive jargon, the goal would be to raise its salience in order to be seen to reject it — much as Donald Trump in 2016 brazenly rejected unpopular GOP positions on entitlements that other Republican rivals were trying to merely soft-pedal.
But then along with this rhetorical fire directed leftward, popularists would also need go further in addressing the actual policy concerns surrounding the issues they’re trying to defuse. Immigration is a major political problem for Democrats right now, for instance, not just because their activists have taken extreme positions on the issue, but because the border is a major policy problem: The effects of globalized travel and communication make it ever-easier for sudden migrant surges to overwhelm the system, and liberalism’s shift away from tough enforcement — or at least its professed desire to make that shift — creates extra incentives for those surges to happen under Democratic presidents.
So in the long run — especially given climate change’s likely effect on mass migration — there is no way for Democrats to have a stable policy that’s pro-immigration under the law without first having a strategy to make the American border much more secure than it’s been under the Biden administration to date. How to do that humanely is a policy challenge, but if you really want to court voters for whom the issue matters, you have to take the challenge seriously — because the problem makes itself salient, and it isn’t going away.
It’s worth noting that even this combination — attack progressive excess, show Obama-Trump voters that you take their issues seriously — is still a somewhat defensive one. When Trump reoriented the Republican Party to win more working-class votes, he made a sweeping and dramatic — and yes, demagogic — case that he would be better than Hillary Clinton for their interests and their values. Democrats have specific ideas that poll well with these voters, but it’s not clear that even a sweeping “heartland revival” message could actually reverse the post-Trump shift.
But even a strictly defensive strategy, one that just prevents more Hispanic voters from shifting to the Republicans and holds on to some of Biden’s modest Rust Belt gains, would buy crucial time for Democrats — time for a generational turnover that still favors them, and time to seize the opportunities that are always offered, in ways no data scientist can foretell, by unexpected events."

Enrollment, diversity increases at some Texas colleges
By Brittany Britto

Some Texas colleges are seeing increases in enrollment, particularly among underrepresented groups, despite the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.
The University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas A&M, Rice University, Houston Baptist universities, and the University of Texas at Austin all welcomed more students than last year, according to the colleges’ preliminary reports.
UT-Austin boasted its largest incoming class, with 9,060 first-time freshmen — a 7 percent increase from last year. Overall enrollment at UT also increased by 3 percent with 51,992 students — close to its all-time high of 52,261 in 2002, according to a news release.
Texas A&M’s enrollment increased by about 2.6 percent with 72,982 students on its first day of classes.
Rice saw an 8 percent increase in its overall enrollment and nearly a 5 percent increase in undergraduate students.
St. Thomas also welcomed its largest freshman cohort, with more than 380 students and, like other colleges, emphasized its diversity and inclusion within the student base.
Of St. Thomas’ incoming students, 64 percent are Hispanic or Latino, further cementing the private Catholic school as a Hispanic Serving Institution. Around 11 percent are Asian American or Pacific Islander, 17 percent Caucasian, and nearly 10 percent Black, university officials said.
UT noted an increase of first-generation students by roughly 3 percent, which makes this population around 23 percent of all undergraduates. The university also enrolled more Hispanic students than last year, reaching 27.1 percent Hispanic undergraduate enrollment, and increased its international population by 13 percent, university data shows.
And while diversity has seemingly been at the forefront, the number of white students attending Texas colleges has decreased.
At UT, the number of white undergraduates dropped by 2 percentage points — from 37.3 percent to 35.1 percent this year. Rice saw its white graduate student population decrease by around 3 percent, while nearly every other population saw more students.
At Houston Community College, where Black and Hispanic or Latinx students enrolled at consistent rates, the white student population decreased around 8 percent. And at Prairie View A&M University, where enrollment grew by 1.5 percent, its white population decreased by 8 percent.
Daniel Villanueva, a higher ed scholar and practitioner, said the decline in white students at Texas institutions could be because many come from socioeconomic backgrounds that allow them to be more mobile and flexible in their college choices, whereas students from underrepresented communities might be more committed to familial responsibilities and jobs where they live and thus, choose to stay closer to home.
Villanueva is vice president of enrollment and management at the University of Houston-Downtown, and said UHD’s population is also slowly but surely becoming more Hispanic and less white. At UHD, the Hispanic and Latinx population grew 1 percent over the past year and 7 percent since 2019, while the white population decreased by 9 percent since last fall alone.
Similarly, Houston Baptist University, which had its highest record of overall and freshman enrollment, saw a surge in Hispanic and Black students this fall, but a decrease in white students.
“We see that more white students have options to go out-of-state and that more out-of-state institutions that are right around Texas offer in-state tuition waivers for students,” Villanueva said. “And so as white students navigate higher ed, they’re not only looking at the landscape exclusive to Texas but nationwide.”
While this trend is more specific to Texas, the trend of increasing diversity — particularly among Hispanic and female students — is happening nationwide, Villanueva said.
Prairie View A&M data also showed that students are pursuing post-baccalaureate certificates and doctoral degrees at higher percentages this year, but that the number of sophomore students enrolled declined by about 90 people or 5 percent. The number of applicants and those admitted also decreased by more than 13 percent compared to last fall.
For other colleges, enrollment stayed flat or decreased only slightly.
Preliminary numbers at the University of Houston showed that its student population largely stayed the same, decreasing by just 70 students. Lone Star College’s student population decreased by less than 1 percent.
HCC experienced a 2 percent decrease in overall enrollment — a positive sign considering enrollment dropped a whopping 17 percent last fall, said Shantay Grays, vice chancellor for student services.
The community college system has seen increases in other areas, including a 6 percent increase in new students and a 3 percent rise in enrollment in it its continuing education program, which hosts short-term training.
“We attribute that the anticipation of reopening and allowing students to access those skilled labs that they need,” she said. And returning students, who might have stopped during a previous semester, have also enrolled at a higher rate, she said.
But HCC is not letting its guard up.
The college’s dual credit enrollment program decreased 10 percent since last fall, a dip officials attribute to learning loss and some of the difficulties the Houston Independent School District has had engaging and accounting for its students.
Though it’s difficult to pinpoint all of the challenges that students might face, HCC has hired 45 admissions advisers as staff who will be embedded in high schools in areas HCC services, Grays said. Staff will help facilitate enrollment for dual-credit programs and engage previous students they might have lost during the pandemic."

If you’re a Black or Latin classical composer, these two want to hear from you
By Lawrence Elizabeth Knox

Cuban American cellist Thomas Mesa is on a mission to amplify historically underrepresented voices in classical music.
In an effort to keep the diversity conversation at the forefront, the sought-after soloist and educator is joining forces with pianist Michelle Cann, the social-justice group Sphinx Organization and PARMA Recordings to present a new call for scores open exclusively to Black and Latinx composers from around the world. The collaborators are seeking works for solo cello or cello and piano, ideally between five and 15 minutes in length, submissions for which will be accepted through Nov. 5.
Up to six winners will be announced early next year, and each selected composition will be brought to life by Mesa and Cann in a studio recording produced by PARMA’s Grammy-winning team for an album release on the company’s Navona Records imprint. The fully funded opportunity, made possible by a Sphinx MPower Artist Grant, provides recipients with full ownership of the resulting master recording, all post-production and promotional support, a majority share of received royalties from streams and sales, a $250 honorarium and more.
“Composers are our other half in the relationship to music,” Mesa said. “I’m always trying to find different ways to communicate with audiences, and that means playing a lot of different kinds of music, so essentially what I wanted to do was find great music. Find great music that will make people feel like they’re really discovering something special.”
The cellist, recognized as one of the most charismatic performers of his generation, released “Division of Memory” in early October. The album, a comprehensive collection featuring five compositional personalities, was the result of another call for scores in collaboration with PARMA. Given its success, Mesa felt pulled to repeat the process while zeroing in on a more focused purpose, offering composers from minority communities a channel through which their creative voices may be heard.
In the evaluation process, Mesa, who recently joined the faculty at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College, is first and foremost drawn to compositions that immerse listeners in a sound world unique to the composer or piece, allowing them to be fully surrounded by the aesthetic experience. He also looks for a clear understanding of the instrumentation and although not essential, a work’s potential to communicate through narrative.
In addition to gaining exposure, the selected composers will have the chance to build relationships with PARMA and Sphinx, a prominent music production company and a national organization igniting change at the intersection of social justice and the arts, respectively.
With its various layers of impact, however, Mesa’s brainchild offers a platform for everyone involved. Beyond finding new inspiration and fostering innovation, the musician welcomed the opportunity to reconnect with Cann, who holds the inaugural Eleanor Sokoloff chair in piano studies at the Curtis Institute of Music, after the pair first collaborated in a concert with the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society last February. Now, they are uniting to further a mission that lies at the heart of both PARMA and Sphinx. By unearthing rising minority talent, this call for scores promotes inclusion and works toward the vision that one day, the classical music industry will reflect the rich diversity of the human experience.
“Not only do we not see as many musicians and instrumentalists of color out there performing, we also don’t see enough Black and Latino composers,” Cann said. “What Tommy is doing, it touches on a lot of things, and I think they’re all impactful. One of those things is, for him as a Latino American and for me as a Black American, to show that we care about performing music by composers of color, getting it recorded at a high level.”
“Sometimes you need somebody to shake the pot for changes to happen,” she continued, “and we hope to try to change the field from our little corner.”"

Abortions fell by half after Texas ban went into effect, study says
Taylor Goldenstein

The number of abortions in Texas fell by almost half following the state’s enactment of the country’s most restrictive abortion law, a new University of Texas study found.
Senate Bill 8 bans abortions after six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. It is enforced not by the government, but rather by civilians empowered to file civil suits against those they suspect to have broken it, collecting at least $10,000 from the defendants if their cases are successful.
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments Monday on a pair of cases challenging the law.
The nearly 50 percent drop marks the largest recent downturn in accessibility to the procedure following major state-level policy changes, according to the study from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. It found that 2,164 abortions were provided in September 2021 compared with 4,313 during that month in the previous year.
“The fact that many facilities maintained pre-SB8 staffing levels in the face of reduced patient volume, coupled with the increased availability of financial assistance for abortion care, may have prevented even greater declines,” the study authors wrote.
Clinics had time to prepare for the law to take effect and made adjustments to fit in as many patients as possible before then, authors noted. Once it took effect, with fewer people eligible to have abortions, scheduling was also likely easier for those who were eligible.
Others might have made decisions to miss work, school or other responsibilities knowing that their time was limited given the new law, the authors added. An increase in donations after the passage of the law also could have helped some low-income patients cover the cost of their abortion and get it sooner.
By contrast, there was about a 13 percent decline in abortions statewide after the implementation of House Bill 2 in 2013. That bill created barriers for abortion clinics that were later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet its restrictions caused the shuttering of more than half of the Texas facilities where abortions were performed.
Even more impactful was Gov. Greg Abbott’s March executive order banning all “elective procedures,” which included abortions, causing abortions to decrease by 38 percent.
The UT study also examined wait times at out-of-state facilities and found that they were longer in most cases in September 2021 compared with wait times in July of the previous year, the most recent data available.
Researchers said this suggests that the facilities are seeing a surge of patients — even though neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma have about half the number of abortion facilities combined, and provide about a third as many abortions per year as Texas. They found it was common for patients to experience wait times longer than two weeks at many locations.
“These waits may push pregnant people past the limit for medication abortion or into the second trimester of pregnancy, when procedures have a somewhat higher risk of complications compared to those obtained earlier in pregnancy,” the authors wrote.
Wait times in Louisiana, which has three clinics, for example, ranged from eight to 19 days in September, compared with about eight days in July. In Oklahoma, which has four clinics, it had been between two and 12 days. Last month, it rose to between five and 23 days.
The study authors said the data signifies a crisis to come, especially if restrictions in other states go into effect, such as proposed changes to Oklahoma’s abortion laws.
“As services become further limited in Texas and nearby states, more people will be unable to obtain facility-based abortion care,” the authors wrote. “Among those most affected will be minors who cannot involve a parent in their care, immigrant families who fear encounters with police and border enforcement, parents who have limited childcare options, and people living at or below poverty, many of whom are Black, Latinx, and other people of color.”"

Essay: Here’s how to stop displacement. Neighborhoods don’t have to be rich to be vibrant.
By Joseph Margulies

When it comes to neighborhood well-being, is failure the inevitable cost of success?
Consider this familiar story from Providence, Rhode Island. In its salad days, the neighborhood of Olneyville was home to a thriving textile industry. But the looms went quiet long ago, and for much of the 20th century it was one of the most distressed places in the state. In 1978, the Providence Planning Department found that over half of Olneyville’s houses needed “immediate attention,” were in a state of “advanced deterioration” or were “heavily deteriorated and dilapidated.”
Today, people reach for different words when they describe Olneyville: Hip. Trendy. Chic. Neighborhood nonprofits converted a sprawling, toxic dump into a prize-winning park. A community development corporation replaced scores of vacant lots and abandoned buildings with below-market rate housing. School officials remade a local elementary school into a treasured neighborhood anchor.
But the victories that low-income residents and their allies worked so hard to achieve brought the neighborhood to the attention of an entirely new demographic. Olneyville in the 21st century has also become whiter, significantly more unequal, and substantially more expensive. Gentrification now threatens the Latinx community that has called Olneyville home since the 1990s.
Of course, what is happening in Olneyville is happening across the country, including in Houston. In a 2018 ranking of the 20 fastest gentrifying zip codes in the country, two were in Houston. No other city except Brooklyn had more than one. In one of those 20, the zip code for the Washington Avenue Corridor, home values climbed 107 percent, household income increased 114 percent and the number of people with at least a bachelor’s degree rose 188 percent.
The same forces also threaten the historically Black Third Ward. In 2010, nearly three in four residents of Third Ward were African American. Today, the figure is less than half. In eight short years between 2010 and 2018, the non-Hispanic white population in Third Ward increased by 150 percent and the percent of the population with a college degree more than doubled. And in just half that time — from 2010 to 2014 — average home prices in Third Ward increased by 85 percent.
The lesson is that America’s current approach to neighborhood well-being can transform places like Olneyville or Third Ward but cannot protect them. This poses morally urgent questions: Do the ploughshares we use to improve a neighborhood become the swords that destroy it? In the wealthiest country on earth, can it really be that the poor only get to live in wretched places? Is it simply impossible to create a low-income neighborhood that is also safe, healthy, vibrant and sustainably affordable?
I spent four years studying Olneyville’s transformation — research that started quite by accident. I went to Providence in 2017 to learn about its police department, which was said to have transformed from a corrupt, brutal, paramilitary organization in the 20th century to a national model of community policing in the 21st."

LULAC drops use of 'Latinx' as term for Hispanics, considering it 'non-inclusive'
By Olivia P. Tallet

LULAC National President Domingo Garcia (top center) addresses a crowd as state and local members of League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) gather to walk from Milam Park to Main Plaza to mobilize Latino communities to vote and get involved in community affairs. They are making the Freedom Walks for Justice, inspired by the Freedom Riders active during the 1960s civil rights movement, in 15 cities in eight states. About 50 people carrying signs, flags and a print of the Statue of Liberty walked under a police escort to hold a small rally in Main Plaza with the mission of encouraging the Latino community to vote. (Kin Man Hui/San Antonio Express-News)
The country’s oldest Hispanic civil rights organization has decided to drop the use of “Latinx” as a pan-ethnic term to refer to people of Hispanic or Latino heritage, saying it considers the word to be “non-inclusive” and at odds with its centric, non-partisan political positions.
Domingo Garcia, the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, instructed the organization to stop using Latinx in official communications after a survey by the research firm Bendixen and Amandi published last week found only 2 percent of Hispanic or Latino voters chose the word Latinx to describe their ethnic background and 40 percent said the term bothers or offends them.
“I thought it was important that we drop a term, Latinx, that is not used by José and María on the streets and is not used by most people to define themselves in our communities,” García told the Chronicle.
The new survey confirmed similar results of polls during the last couple of years.
A national poll of over 3,000 Hispanic adults by Pew Research Center conducted in December 2019 found that only 23 percent of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino had heard of the term Latinx, and just 3 percent say they use it to describe themselves.
Another study last year by ThinkNow Research found that 98 percent of Latino-Hispanic people do not identify with the word “Latinx.”
Latinx has emerged as a term gaining greater use among a sector of progressive organizations and politicians, arguably for being more inclusive than Hispanic or Latino. Latinx is also used by some marketers and entertainment firms. But Garcia said many Latinos see it differently.
“It isn’t inclusive; they don’t feel included,” Garcia said of the vast majority of people of Hispanic and Latino heritage, citing recent polls.
Garcia clarified that LULAC’s move is against the use of Latinx as a pan-ethnic identifier and not as a individual identity word. People of Latino and Hispanic heritage use various ways to identify themselves individually or in subgroups, from Cuban American (based on the country of origin) to Chicano (reflecting a connection to the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s and ‘70s).
Garcia said Latinx “was invented out of the air by a very small minority… that is not reflective of what people in our community use day to day.”
Experts say Latinx is a term initially coined in academic circles of gender studies to identify people of Hispanic or Latino origin who are gender non-binary, meaning individuals who do not identify themselves as a man or woman.
Latino or Latina come from the Spanish language, where singular nouns are gendered with an “o” or “a” at the end of the word to denote masculine or feminine, respectively. Latinx erases the last vowels to create a gender-neutral word, which is favored by some as more inclusive and gender-neutral.
“I don’t have an issue with the word Latinx,” said Juan Alanis, co-founder of the marketing firm Big Oak Tree Media in Houston. “It is not a word I use often to self-identify, but I have used it and understand the intention of it to be more inclusive.”
Some organizations that use the word Latinx didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Despite the good intentions of inclusiveness, the latest poll has increased the controversy surrounding the term. Among the concerns is that Latinx isn’t a word organically created and grown from inside the community, but rather a term invented and imposed on Hispanics collectively by institutions and people in positions of power, often from non-Hispanic backgrounds.
An opinion piece in Newsweek magazine characterized its use as a pan-ethnic word as “lexical imperialism.” “However well-meaning it might be, it's actually imposing a foreign worldview on an entire people,” says its author Angel Eduardo. “It's telling them, in essence, ‘We're going to take your savage, backward language, force it to adhere to our superior gender norms, and impose this change upon you so that you can be good, right, and just — like us!”
The new poll also found that 30 percent of those surveyed said they are less likely to support a political organization that uses the term Latinx when discussing the Hispanic or Latino community. This finding was immediately sized by Republican operatives to blast Democrats for continuing “to push unpopular, offensive words like Latinx,” said Macarena Martinez, Texas GOP communications director, in an email.
Democrats and Republicans have been battling it out for the Latino vote in Texas and elsewhere, and even though former President Donald Trump began his career disparaging Mexican coming to the U.S. as “rapists” and criminals, surveys showed he made some inroads in the Hispanic community in 2020.
Garcia said that the decision to drop Latinx from official communications is also consistent with LULAC's nonpartisan, civic-engagement mission.
“You got people in the far left that are using Latinx and they want to abolish ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and they want to abolish the police, that 98 percent of Latinos are against,” said Garcia. “Then you got people on the far right that, they're using (phrases such as) illegal aliens and anchor babies and wet backs, which are racist, derogatory.”
Garcia said the organization wants to “keep a middle-of-the-road approach” that he believes is more reflective of “the Main Street sentiments” among Hispanics and Latinos."

Groups file federal complaint over I-45 project, urge civil rights review
By Dug Begley

Critics of the plan to remake Interstate 45 north of downtown Houston filed a nearly 100-page complaint to federal officials Thursday, urging even greater scrutiny of the project’s effects on minority communities, an analysis they say state highway officials consistently have avoided.
In the complaint, filed with the Federal Highway Administration, opponents of the current project accuse the Texas Department of Transportation of spending years promoting and designing a project that residents consistently told them would tear the fabric of nearby neighborhoods. Many of those neighborhoods are majority Black and Latino communities, the complaint notes, which TxDOT failed to adequately consider.
“Throughout the… planning process, which has gone on for almost 20 years, less-discriminatory alternatives have been raised by multiple stakeholders, but TxDOT has repeatedly rejected those alternatives and clung to a project that imposes highly disproportionate and adverse effects on Black and Hispanic/Latinx neighborhoods, compounding its previous discriminatory actions and the disproportionate effects of bulldozing highways through these neighborhoods originally,” the complaint stated.
The complaint was filed by Air Alliance Houston, LINK Houston, Stop TxDOT I-45, Texas Housers and Texas Appleseed. All have been active with residents in opposing the I-45 project, estimated to cost at least $10 billion.
In a statement, TxDOT Chief Communications Officer Bob Kaufman said officials were “continuing to work with FHWA to resolve any areas of concern that they may have.”
“That said,” Kaufman continued in an emailed statement, “most people who have been following this project know that the I-45 improvement project will create major safety and operational improvements to an old and congested corridor along with quality of life enhancements for residents, businesses and others.”
In addition to halting the project and asking for reconsideration of many of TxDOT’s findings and proposals to remedy the environmental effects of the project — including its effect on minority communities — the complaint asks for the Department of Justice to “play an active role in coordinating this federal investigation and any enforcement actions.”
The plan to widen I-45, the largest planned freeway rebuild in Houston, stretches from the central business district north to Beltway 8 in Greenspoint. North of downtown, officials are not proposing to add any free lanes, but widening the freeway to put two managed lanes in each direction — similar to the Katy Managed Lanes along Interstate 10 — in the center of I-45.
To add those lanes and make design changes necessary to improve safety on the freeway, officials said more than 1,000 homes and 300 businesses will be affected. Opponents said that is too high a price to pay in oft-ignored communities to continue years of freeway encroachment.
“The health impact of increased traffic air pollution will last for generations,” said Harrison Humphreys, transportation program manager with Air Alliance Houston, in an emailed statement.
State officials, since criticism of the project intensified in 2017, have said they are willing to make changes but cannot drastically change the project after 15 years of work and numerous rounds of public meetings. At many of those steps, local officials have vocally supported TxDOT’s plans, though new city and county officials elected since 2017 have taken a more critical stance."

Latino leaders plan lawsuit to change 'gross' underrepresentation in Houston City Council
By Olivia P. Tallet

The lack of Latinos on the City Council undermines the legitimacy of Houston’s government, experts say, and is something that a prominent Hispanic organization is pushing to change with a lawsuit and ballot proposition.
The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the largest Hispanic civil rights organizations in the country, is tackling what they characterize as a gross underrepresentation of Latinos in one of the most diverse cities in the U.S. by proposing that the five at-large positions on council elected citywide be replaced with four seats in heavily Hispanic districts.
Currently, just one Hispanic — Robert Gallegos — holds a seat on the 16-member body. By contrast, 45 percent of Houston residents are Hispanic.
“The most serious threat to the legitimacy of Houston city government is this idea that you can have half of the population of the city represented by 6 percent of the council,” said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. “Imagine if we flipped things around and there's only one African American on the Houston City Council, or there's only one Anglo, or there's only one woman … It would be seen as a national travesty of democracy; it would be the subject of constant outcry.”
The city is expected to look at redistricting prior to its 2023 election, and could redraw the 11 districts if they are deemed unbalanced at that point. But LULAC said replacing at-large seats with more single-district seats would reduce barriers that undercut Latino representation.
“If we had parity, half of this council would be Latino,” said local LULAC leader Sergio Lira, co-chair of a new Houston taskforce created under the direction of the organization’s national President, Domingo García, who launched the effort in a meeting with local leaders last week.
García, a lawyer with offices statewide, said the effort includes a push to bring a charter amendment with the proposition to citizens to vote on and to file a lawsuit against the city.
Houston has the worst Hispanic representation in city councils among all Texas cities with populations over 500,000, all of which have eliminated at-large positions in their governments, according to census and government data.
“Houston is the outlier in Texas when it comes to Latino representation and is the only large city with at-large seats,” García said.
Those cities — San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso —all have councils that look much more similar to their cities’ Hispanic populations. Dallas, which is 42 percent Hispanic, has the next-lowest Hispanic representation on council with 29 percent Hispanics.
It’s tough to get elected to Houston’s at-large seats, García said.
“They are very difficult for Latinos to win because of the amount of money, coalitions and logistics it takes to win,” he said. “It’s like running for mayor.”
Mayor Sylvester Turner should put LULAC’s proposition for a charter amendment to a vote in the City Council. It would need to be approved by two-thirds of the members to be put on the ballot, Garcia and other said.
PLAN AHEAD: Early voting starts Monday in City Council District G special election. Here’s who is running.
“But we are not under any illusion that this will happen,” said Lira, noting that it would require the support of at least 10 councilmembers, including some elected at-large who are unlikely to approve a measure that would eliminate their power. At a recent meeting with Turner, “we didn’t get the impression that he would” put it on the agenda, Lira said.
Turner’s office confirmed the meeting with LULAC took place but said “at this time, Mayor Turner has no additional information to provide.”
Pulling ‘the trigger’
Knowing it is a long shot, LULAC decided to initiate a drive to collect 20,000 signatures in February in favor of their proposition, as the early voting for the state primaries begins. The number is the minimum needed to force the inclusion of a charter amendment in the ballot, bypassing the approval of City Council, which would only decide when it should be put for a citizens’ vote.
LULAC is simultaneously preparing a lawsuit it plans to file in court by March to eliminate all at-large positions in favor of single districts.
Supporters of at-large positions argue that they represent the interest of the city as a whole and don’t require boundary redrawing in redistricting processes. But the use of this structure is limited at the federal and state levels since the passing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. It is also decreasing at the city or municipal level in general.
The Houston City Council used to have all at-large positions and was reshaped to the current five-to-11 mix in 1980. Several court cases have successfully challenged at-large positions under the Voting Rights Act in Texas and elsewhere, including Williams vs the City of Dallas, which eliminated all remaining such positions in the council in the 90s. More recently, in Patino v. Pasadena, a federal court revoked the creation of new at-large positions by the city in 2017, concluding that it “dilute(d) the votes of its Latino citizens.”
“Historically and statistically, it has been shown to be true that single district (positions) elect more racial and ethnic minorities than at-large seats,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. Single districts facilitate the concentration of political power for disadvantaged communities nested in certain neighborhoods, providing a numerical advantage that is harder to overcome in at-large elections, he said.
“To have only one Latino member in the (Houston) council is pretty glaring,” Rottinghaus said.
Rather than having to prove discriminatory intent in challenging the at-large districts under the Voting Rights Act, plaintiffs such as LULAC would “need only to show that a particular voting practice produces a discriminatory result,” as shown in Patino v. Pasadena quoting a 1982 Congressional amendment of the act.
“The proof is in the pudding that since 2001, there have been 45 straight at-large elections, (and) zero Latino victories,” said Jones, who is also a Baker Institute fellow who wrote an op-ed about the Latino underrepresentation in the City Council in the Houston Chronicle in 2020. “At-large districts benefit dominant populations and hurt populations that are weaker politically.”
Houston and its leaders need to realize that having only one Latino in the council is a problem.
It fosters a sentiment of political alienation among some Hispanics in Houston who wish to see more leadership in their communities, participants at the LULAC meeting said.
“We have to get our voices out and be aggressive, not just like begging the boss with the hat in our hands to give us something,” said García in Spanish."

New fund awards $2 million to 120 art groups serving Houston’s communities of color
By Sam González Kelly

A new philanthropic initiative to support artists of color in the Houston area on Wednesday announced the first 120 arts organizations to receive a combined $2 million in grants to use as they see fit.
Twenty-five panelists with the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) Arts Network & Fund awarded the grants, which ranged from $5,000 to $50,000, to a diverse selection of nonprofits, art collectives, studios, festivals and projects.
To be eligible for a grant, the artists or arts programs had to be based in Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery or Waller counties.
About half of the grantees are registered nonprofits, while the other half are fiscally sponsored artists’ collectives. A full list of the winners, chosen from 155 applications, can be seen at houstonbanf.org.
“There are vital connections between communities of color and our unique art and cultural expressions that celebrate our histories, acknowledge our perseverance and project a productive future,” said Michelle Barnes, co-founder and executive director of Community Artists’ Collective, which received a $35,000 grant.
“When there is an investment in us, there is an investment in our cultural communities. I’m honored to be a part of this historic moment in Houston BIPOC arts, and I’m proud of my fellow grantees who also have important histories of impact in our communities throughout the Greater Houston area and beyond,” Barnes said.
The BIPOC Arts Network & Fund, or BANF, received a total of $12.4 million to distribute over the next five years. The initiative is funded by the Ford Foundation, Houston Endowment, The Brown Foundation Inc., The Cullen Foundation, Kinder Foundation and The Powell Foundation.
“We saw this as an opportunity to learn from the written and spoken words of applicants what our communities’ strengths and challenges are as they face the current economic, social and health realities of today,” said BANF project director Sixto Wagan.
“The full spectrum of the arts community, from funders to BIPOC arts organizations, acknowledged this approach as a catalyst for change and one that must continue in 2022 and beyond,” Wagan said."

‘Last Cuentista,’ ‘Watercress’ win children’s book awards
By Hillel Italie

Donna Barba Higuera’s “The Last Cuentista,” a post-apocalyptic tale of a young girl who must preserve the memory of Earth’s history, has won the John Newbery Medal for the year’s best children’s book.
Another story of memory was awarded the Randolph Caldecott Medal for outstanding children’s picture book. “Watercress,“ in which a Chinese American girl learns about her heritage, was illustrated by Jason Chin and written by Andrea Wang.
The Newbery and Caldecott medals were part of the Youth Media Awards announced Monday by the American Library Association.
Higuera also received a Pura Belpre Award, which honors Latinx writers and illustrators, for best author, while “Watercress” was also named the year’s outstanding Asian/Pacific American picture book. Malinda Lo’s “Last Night at the Telegraph Club,” winner last fall of the National Book Award for young people’s literature, received the Asian/Pacific American Award for Youth Literature.
A book illustrated by the beloved artist Floyd Cooper, who died last year, was a finalist for the Caldecott prize and received Coretta Scott King awards for the year’s best book by a Black author and illustrator. Cooper collaborated with author Carole Boston Weatherford on the historical work “Unspeakable: The Tulsa Race Massacre,“ about the 1921 slaughter of a Black community in Oklahoma by a mob of white people.
Nikki Grimes, whose dozens of works include the 2002 Coretta Scott King winner for best book “Bronx Masquerade,” received the Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement. Grace Lin, a Taiwanese American whose works include “The Ugly Vegetables“ and “The Red Thread,” has won the Children’s Literature Legacy Award for “books that demonstrate integrity and respect for all children’s lives and experiences.” The Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement for a young adult writer went to A.S. King, author of “Still Life with Tornado” and “Ask the Passengers” among others."

Stages Houston’s celebration of Latinx playwrights marks 5-year anniversary
By Sam González Kelly

“Sin Muros: A Borderless Teatro Festival” opens Thursday at Stages Houston, the fifth straight year that the Montrose theater company hosts the celebration of Latinx playwrights and performers with Texas roots.
The four-day festival features readings of new plays by Karen Alvarado, Alicia Margarita Olivo, Adrienne Dawes and Josie Nericcio, performed by a full cast of actors. In addition to the new plays, the festival will feature poetry readings, an arts market, a professional development workshop and a creative writing workshop.
The festival is free and open to the public, though organizers suggest a $25 donation for a weekend pass from those who can afford it. The festival will take place at The Gordy, Stages Houston’s new space at 800 Rosine St., with the exception of one reading, Nericcio’s “Easter Sunday at the Juarez Flower Shop,” which will be hosted virtually.
According to Lupe Mendez, the 2022 Texas Poet Laureate and one of the founding members of “Sin Muros,” the festival began five years ago as a way to highlight the vibrant Latinx theater community in Texas, where there is an abundance of Latinx playwrights, companies and actors who simply need a space to showcase their work.
“There’s one-off shows and productions, but there isn’t one space that’s dedicated to Latinx or Latin American theater. The groups that are doing the work don’t have their own space,” Mendez, this year’s festival coordinator, said.
Join the conversation with HouWeAre: A newsletter on race, identity and culture in one of America's most diverse cities
“The idea was to pick three playwrights — as long as they’ve got roots in Texas, whether they live here or have family here or studied here — to submit a play they’ve been working on that hasn’t been fully produced, and we’ll do a reading to help them move along the theater-making process,” Mendez said.
When the festival went virtual last year, “Sin Muros” was able to take the budget they normally would have spent on in-person expenses and use it to expand the offerings from three readings to four, Mendez said.
“Sin Muros” was put together by a task force of “activists, educators, artistas, grassroots organizers, Ph.Ds, compadres y comadres,” according to Stages, including Teatrx, a Latinx theatre company started in 2018 in Houston, and Tintero Projects, a writing development group founded by Mendez and his wife, the author Jasminne Mendez.
Now in its fifth year, the task force reviewed over a dozen submissions before landing on the four plays that will be read this weekend. They are “Body of Christie” by Karen Alvarado, “Count Yourself Among the Lucky” by Alicia Margarita Olivo, “This B---h: Esta Sangre Quiero” by Adrienne Dawes and “Easter Sunday at the Juarez Flower Shop” by Josie Nericcio.
“It's really very simple for me - there are powerhouse voices writing great plays who have not had the kind of access or resources necessary to grow and develop their work,” said Stages Houston Artistic Director Kenn McLaughlin.
“Stages seeks to change that and make space for the voices of Latinx writers from our community and our state so that there can be a more robust representation in our artistic conversations and in our civic spaces as well,” he said.
“Sin Muros: A Borderless Teatro Festival” runs from Thursday through Sunday. A full schedule of events, along with descriptions of each play and a link to register for passes, can be found at stageshouston.com."

Houston’s Adam Castañeda finds purpose in an unexpected, dance-filled life
By Lawrence Elizabeth Knox

Waves of movement would roll through a young Adam Castañeda’s mind, his imagination running wild as he would envision music videos to any given song. The impulse to dance was ingrained in him from the get-go, even if not part of his conversation, coming from a working-class, Mexican American household.
When he was 24 years old, however, the native Houstonian stepped into a studio to take his first class and found a sense of self amid an overarching identity transition.
Castañeda was in the process of leaving the Jehovah’s Witness church, in which he had been raised, baptized as a teenager, and later appointed to the role of ministerial servant. He even gave Sunday sermons in his early 20s. In coming to terms with his sexuality at an age when eligible women were looking to him as potential husband material, he realized he would never fit the mold. Unwilling to hide his truth, he took a page from Elizabeth Gilbert’s story and embarked upon a nearly six-month journey of self-discovery in India, “Eat Pray Love” style.
He returned home with a broadened perspective on life and without hesitation, began his dance training at Houston Community College, where he also joined the faculty as an adjunct English professor, putting his bachelor’s and master’s degrees to good use. Undeterred by his late start in the dance world, he found motivation in the positive feedback he was receiving and proceeded to attend open classes around town.
Fast forward a little over a decade, Castañeda, now 36, has become a staple in the city’s arts scene. As executive and artistic director of the Pilot Dance Project, he seeks to empower and transform communities through innovative dance and performing arts experiences with a focus on producing evening-length works by a variety of independent choreographers.
“I want people to fall in love with modern dance again, good old-fashioned modern and post-modern dance like the ’70s and ’80s,” said Castañeda, who was a company dancer at FrenetiCore and hired as its executive director before taking the helm in 2016 and refashioning the ensemble to suit his artistic vision.
This weekend, he will shine light on minority voices, as the Pilot Dance Project presents its second annual Texas Latino/a/x Contemporary Dance Festival at the Midtown Arts and Theater Center Houston. Held live and in-person for the first time, the three-day event will feature an array of dance styles and representation from over 20 artists, including returning choreographers like Lídice Nuñez of Alas Dance Company, Roberta Paixão Cortes and Kristina Prats. They will be joined by several newcomers to the roster, such as Elisa De La Rosa of De La Rosa Dance Company, Mark Travis Rivera, Estefani Valle, Mariah Henry of Deeper Than Dance and more.
Each night, the Pilot Dance Project will perform a different excerpt from Castañeda’s latest choreographic work, “Lazarus in the Promised Land.” A tribute to his late paternal grandparents, the piece explores his family lineage and religious faith, its debut last November aligning with the 10-year anniversary of his leaving the Jehovah’s Witness belief system.
The impetus to produce a festival, such as this, stems back to 2018, the same year Castañeda decided to try his hand at dancemaking. He noticed a number of talented Latinx choreographers emerging from the University of Houston’s dance program, and while he found that exciting, he knew the years of being in-demand would be interspersed with worrisome creative dry spells.
“Pilot Dance Project was still in this phase of figuring out what we wanted to do and what I wanted to do as a director,” he said. “I thought maybe I could add to the conversation and create another opportunity, so that at the very least, these choreographers would have one thing a year to work toward.”
Considering the long-running success of the group’s beloved Houston Fringe Festival, which supports artists of all disciplines, another festival seemed only natural. Originally set to premiere in March of 2020, the inaugural event was canceled due to the pandemic and was instead presented as a virtual concert the following spring. Having established its presence, this year’s program is supported by a Festival grant from the City of Houston through the Houston Arts Alliance.
Castañeda never dreamed that he would become a dancer, choreographer or director, and yet, he has become all of those things and more. Come June, he plans to launch another initiative - the Queer Fringe Festival, created to uplift and celebrate LGBTQ+ performing artists.
“I want to be an arts advocate,” he said of his ultimate mission. “I want people to know that I’m a champion for dance and for everyone else who is an artist.”"

Dozens of Latino law students to get scholarships in Houston
By Olivia P. Tallet

Diana Davila had plenty of people telling her that pursuing a career in law wasn’t a good idea. She heard it was too expensive and support was limited for young Hispanic women like her, a first-generation Mexican American immigrant from the Rio Grande Valley.
“I faced a lot of obstacles, but I ended up being the first everything in my family,” said Davila. “I grew up in a family where English isn’t the first language, but I am the first one to graduate from college in the United States, the first one to do any type of grad school, and will be the first lawyer among my relatives and childhood friends.”
Davila said her story is similar to those of the 40 Latino law students, including herself, who on Friday will receive scholarships at the 8th Annual Scholarship Gala of three Houston law schools to be celebrated at the Rice Hotel’s Chrystal Ballroom.
The gala is organized annually by the student associations of the South Texas College of Law Houston, the University of Houston Law Center, and the Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law. Hundreds of students have received scholarships since 2015 when the associations began the gala celebration.
The scholarships are provided by the student associations as well as by the Hispanic Bar Association of Houston and the Mexican American Bar Association of Houston.
The Hispanic Bar Association will award scholarships of $1,000, $1,500 and $3,200 to 12 students from the three law schools, while the Mexican American Bar Association will present $1,000 grants to nine students.
“We hope to encourage and support students and people by giving them scholarships so that they can continue pursuing their dream of becoming a lawyer and hopefully being in a position where they can give back in the future,” said Cristina González, president of the Mexican American Bar Association and an attorney at Crim & Villalpando, PC.
González, a Houstonian born from Mexican parents and the only woman and Latina attorney at the firm where she works, said that she is “deeply passionate about helping others” like her succeed in their careers.
Davila, who is the president of the Hispanic Law Students Association at South Texas College of Law and one of the event organizers, said that each of the student associations raises funds by doing activities such as “Cafecitos” or Little Coffee events where they sell the beverage and Mexican sweet bread. Another popular activity is a Halloween party organized by the Thurgood Marshall School of Law.
The organization she presides over will present $500 scholarships to four students at the gala, while the Hispanic Law Students Association at Thurgood Marshall School of Law is giving $300 to $400 grants to nine Latino students. The Latinx Law Students Association from the University of Houston Law Center will award $1,000 scholarships to three of its students.
Hispanics are significantly underrepresented in the legal profession and in the last decade have experienced an increase of barely 1 percent in the number of lawyers nationwide.
While Hispanics comprise the second largest population group in the U.S., they account for only 5 percent of attorneys, according to the American Bar Association’s 2021 Profile of the Legal Profession.
“Sadly, the legal profession is the least diverse profession of all,” said Benny Agosto, managing partner of the law firm Abraham Watkins Nichols Agosto Aziz and Stogner in Houston, who will be one of the speakers at the event.
Agosto said that less than 10 percent of layers in Texas are Latinos, citing reports from this profession.
“The collective efforts to raise money for scholarships benefiting Latino and Latina law students will assist greatly in balancing this disparity, (and) I am committed to it,” said Agosto. He and his wife Nikki donated $3 million last year to create a diversity center at the South Texas College of Law campus.
Julio González, president of the Latinx Law Students Association at the UH Law Center said that economic hardship and a lack of historic access to higher education among Latino families are the main hurdles for students like him to become lawyers.
“Thankfully,” González said, “there have been Latino lawyers and legal scholars who have been chipping away at barriers (and) opening doors for new generations like mine.”
He, like Davila, represents the first generation to attend higher education in his family, graduating in May from law school. They both are among students receiving scholarships at the gala to pay for costs associated with studying and obtaining their State Bar of Texas license.
“I think it's important for us to continue to celebrate the progress that we've made” at the scholarship gala, said González. “This is like a circle, and we will also continue pushing forward and offering more opportunities, and offering more resources within our own community to really build each other up.”"

In a strip mall full of sequins, Houston’s drag community prepares for statewide pageant
By Sam González Kelly

In the corner of a Gandhi District strip mall, long after the last few diners had trickled out of its many popular Indian restaurants Sunday evening, a few dozen gay and transgender Houstonians gathered to watch the coronation of Zinnya Whitney Ross — and their night was just getting started.
She stepped slowly down the stairs of the low-lit Crystal Nightclub stage wearing an orange, floral-printed dress and an auburn wig teased high and falling back over her shoulders. In her arms was a blue, pink and white transgender flag, which she held wide as she approached the five judges seated at a table on the dance floor.
Ross, who goes by Zee Gaytan off stage, was a staple of Houston’s drag scene for over a decade, but took a hiatus to focus on recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. On Sunday night, Ross returned to the stage for the first time in about six years, marking the beginning of her quest to win a statewide title this summer.
“I’m in a different state of my life financially and mentally... Five or six years ago, I was doing well and winning titles, but I wasn’t where I needed to be mentally to win Miss Gay Texas USofA, and I think for the first time now I’m capable of actually winning,” Ross, 36, said.
Though Sunday’s pageant was full of the energy and glamour one might expect from a drag show, with showcases from about a dozen other prominent Texas performers, the competition itself was anticlimactic. Ross’s only opponent dropped out of the race at the last minute, making her the default choice to represent the FLAS Trans-Center in the statewide pageant.
Ross, who was crowned Miss Gay FLAS Trans-Center Texas USofA 2023, is one of several Houston-area contestants expected to compete in August with about 30 other drag queens from across the state in the Miss Gay Texas USofA pageant in downtown Houston.
Other local performers including Tisha Flowers, Miss Gay Houston Texas USofA, and Heidi Iman, Miss Gay Papi’s Texas USofA, have already qualified, and more preliminary pageants are expected to be held in the area over the coming weeks.
Miss Gay Texas USofA is one in a series of pageants held under the “Texas USofA” moniker. The group also hosts Miss Gay Texas USofA Classic, for performers over 40, Miss Gay Texas USofA At Large, for performers over 200 pounds, and Mr. Gay Texas USofA, for gay male performers, among others.
FLAS, or the Fundación Latinoamericana De Acción Social, was founded in 1994 by transgender activist Elia Chinó to improve sexual health education and treatment in Houston’s Latinx community at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. The nonprofit has since expanded into a broader public health and advocacy organization, and developed the FLAS Trans-Center specifically as a support group for transgender Latinx people.
While the three-day statewide pageant, Miss Gay Texas USofA, is open to any female impersonator who was born male — regardless of whether they identify as a woman — the preliminary pageant hosted by FLAS at Crystal Nightclub on Sunday was geared specifically toward transgender women.
As Texas lawmakers continue to put transgender children at the center of political debates — attempting to ban them from playing sports or seeking gender-affirming health care — pageants like Miss Texas USofA and their preliminaries provide a place for community members to celebrate who they are and cement the progress they have made toward living as their true selves.
“It’s not just a beauty pageant, it’s a way for us to find the trans leaders in our community. Doing stuff like this makes us more visible, and there are transgender kids who might be scared right now. But if we show them that we’re here, they can do good stuff with their life,” said Kenia Gallardo, 32, who put together Sunday’s pageant.
Erick Castillo, 35, one of the owners and promoters of Miss Texas USofA, said, “The transgender community has come such a long way, as well as the (queer) community as a whole, and it would be heartbreaking to see everything that we’ve worked so hard for be pushed back just because of somebody else’s decisions.”
Ross lip-synced “And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going” for the talent portion of Sunday’s pageant, hugging herself so tightly she nearly keeled over in an uncanny impression of singer Jennifer Hudson from the musical “Dreamgirls.” Other performers included the current Miss Gay Texas USofA, Tonica Cavalli of San Antonio, and Monique Johnson, a fixture on Houston drag stages for decades.
With the shimmering light of a disco ball bouncing off their sequined dresses, the performers sashayed, strutted and somersaulted their way across the nightclub floor and onto its tabletops, collecting tips from beaming friends and spectators as they worked up a sweat. Even the pageant judges pitched in a few bucks.
The pageant ended about 1 a.m. after organizers presented Ross with a silver crown and a bouquet of roses, struggling for just a moment to affix the crown to her towering beehive. Spectators beamed as they took pictures of the new Miss Gay FLAS Trans-Center Texas USofA with the hosts.
“ A lot of trans girls can relate because we run into things where we may not want to tell our story and be who we are, because its hard to be who you are. So if they can see me being successful, a powerful career woman, then why can’t they do it?” Ross said."

Essay: The power of being seen - it's still anything for Selena
By Jaundrea Clay

On the eve of what would be her 51st birthday, it's still anything for Selena. 
Growing up in West Texas in the early 1990s, it was commonplace to hear Selena Quintanilla Pérez's songs on radio waves and TV screens and from the blasting speakers of passing cars. 
Even if you didn't understand all of the words.
One of my fondest Selena memories is as a teen during a Saturday night sleepover at my great-grandmother's, which was becoming increasingly rare as I got older and my schedule filled with sports and other extracurricular activities. 
She was watching ""Sábado Gigante"" (she regularly tuned in to Telemundo and Univision; since her descendants never learned from our matriarch to speak Spanish fluently, I mostly watched for the theatrics), over a shared plate of fried bologna and hot-water cornbread, or pan de maiz frito, if you prefer.
If I remember correctly, I was curled up on the couch re-reading ""A Wrinkle in Time.""
Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice and looked up to see Selena — her infectious smile in trademark red, that mane of hair, and curve-hugging pants that framed the easy, serpentine swivel of her hips. 
Nanny perked up and a smile creased her high cheekbones. ""She's a cute little thing,"" she chuckled. 
As Selena performed, my great-grandmother remarked on how Selena favored one of her first cousin Joe Garcia's daughters; exclaimed at the Black man who was a backup singer and dancer (Don Shelton of Los Dinos); and applauded how beautiful and powerful Selena's voice was, at one point moving her shoulders to the beat of ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.""
It's one of the memories of my great-grandmother that is woven in my colorful, tapestry of life, the textiles and fibers that make me who I am today.
Selena's legacy in music, fashion and pop culture is resilient and encompassing, particularly around the dates of the anniversary of her murder (March 31) and her birthday (April 16); a recent episode of ""Top Chef"" honored her as a pioneering Texas woman; new music and a comic book are set to be released; and renewed declarations of inextinguishable love and ardor dot the social media landscape.
One Twitter thread in particular made me think not only of Selena's legacy, but what she means beyond her reign in Tejano and Latino communities, but in other communities of color, specifically to the Black youths who grew up with her music on their mixtapes and her rebellious spirit in their hearts.
Black folks only know two Yolandas, one commenter surmised — Adams, and the lady who killed Selena. 
What followed were snapshots of Black Texas and beyond that had readily added cumbia to their soulful soundtrack of life; some described learning Spanish by replaying and belting out her tunes on repeat. Still others recalled recording and rewatching her music videos to learn ""the washing machine"" dance.
Good music speaks a universal language. 
Selena was a true crossover artist, but the true wealth of her crossover appeal isn't just that she became more mainstream and accessible; one could argue that, for some, her cultural crossover happened precisely because she wasn't mainstream. Many who look like me heard a voice from the barrio that was raw and angelic, who could sing in a tongue that isn't mainstream and was so often derided as un-American, the dialect of ""illegals"" and cartels, and rarely celebrated for its history, richness and melody. We saw a breathtaking beauty that also didn't fit a Eurocentric ideal, curves and lips that were enviably familiar.
Where mainstream media outlets saw a ""Tejano Madonna,"" we saw the inspiration of Janet Jackson and Donna Summers, cultural and musical icons who Selena herself said were her primary influences. Selena connected cultures, and what emerged was something all her own, on a brilliant trajectory that was cut short far too soon.
In a Harper's Bazaar deconstructive essay of the 2020 Netflix show ""Selena: The Series,"" poet, author and Houston native Vanessa Angélica Villarreal writes about growing up in Houston, and Selena's frequent tour stops to the city:
""(In the 1990s) Houston ... was a thriving transnational epicenter of Black and Latinx music, home to the 'chopped and screwed' DJ technique; Sugar Hill Recording Studios; the cumbia, conjunto, Tejano, and bandas musical genres of La Onda Grupera; and the R&B group who would soon give us Destiny’s Child and later, Beyoncé. In the moss-bricked apartment complexes, trailer parks, and young pine starter homes all along Texas’s east coast, Black and Latinx cultures are next-door neighbors with porous borders, inextricable in their relation. It’s the Texas I know, Selena’s Texas, and one that continues to go unseen.""
Selena is timeless because we all see ourselves in her."

'A giant and legend': UH community mourns the loss of professor emeritus Michael Olivas
By Olivia P. Tallet

Michael Olivas, a law scholar and University of Houston professor emeritus who died last week at age 71, is being remembered as a “giant” and a “legend” whose work had an impact on academic corridors around the country and the lives of many people, particularly in the Latino community.
Olivas died April 22 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M., his hometown, after blood clot complications from a recent knee surgery, according to a post on his Twitter account and a UH news release.
Olivas was a professor at the University of Houston for nearly four decades, retiring in 2019 as William B. Bates Distinguished Chair of Law Emeritus. He had also led the Institute for Higher Education Law & Governance at the UH Law Center, served as acting president of the UH-Downtown campus in 2016 and held posts at the University of Iowa College of Law and at the University of Wisconsin.
“Professor Olivas was an excellent teacher and role model, a renowned scholar, academic entrepreneur and institution builder, and multiple award winner,” said Leonard M. Baynes, dean of the University of Houston Law Center. Olivas “advanced the rule of law, legal education, and service to the community.”
Colleagues described Olivas as a prolific scholar who received the highest distinctions in academia. He was honored with the Triennial Award for Lifetime Service to Legal Education and the Law, the top award given by the Association of American Law Schools.
Olivas also received the Esther Farfel Award, the highest honor given to a UH faculty member, for overall career excellence, among other accolades.
“Professor Olivas was legendary nationwide,” said Sandra Guerra Thompson, one of his colleagues and a professor of law at UH. “His death is unfathomable for so many people!”
Scholars from across the country praised Olivas’ personal qualities and lifetime of achievement.
“He was a legendary law professor of the highest order,” said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. “He worked tirelessly to nurture and develop law professors of color and was a personal mentor, and cheerleader, for scores of them.”
Olivas displayed his intellectual acumen in some 16 books that he authored or coauthored, as well as in speeches and in articles. One of his books, “Suing Alma Mater,” published by Johns Hopkins University Press, won the Steven S. Goldberg Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Education Law, given by the Education Law Association. That award honors scholarly excellence that has had an impact on education law.
Olivas wrote numerous articles and was an advocate in immigration law. He helped articulate the legal framework to allow migrant students such as “Dreamers” to pay in-state tuition at Texas higher education institutions.
The publication Insides Higher ED called Olivas “a fierce advocate for Latinx students,” nothing that he helped a Texas state representative draft the successful 10 percent law.
“The 10% plan allowed the University of Texas to admit the top ten percent of students from each public high school in Texas affording students of a wide variety of backgrounds the opportunity to attend the flagship Texas university,” UH said in a news release.
This move significantly increased the acceptance of Latino and Black students at the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University.
For someone who operated at a high level of intellect and academic productivity, Olivas managed to dedicate “an extraordinary amount of time helping other people in their careers,” recalled Sandra Guerra Thompson.
Ediberto Roman, a law professor at Florida International University, wrote in a post of Olivas’ tireless work to increase diversity.
Roman said there were relatively few Hispanic professors in higher education when Olivas started. To change that, he said, Olivas created, together with the National Hispanic Bar Association, the “Dirty Dozen List” outing schools that failed to have Hispanics on their tenure track faculty. A decade later, he said, the number of Latino professors grew to more than 200 and continued increasing.
Roman was the editor of “Law Professor and Accidental Historian: The Scholarship of Michael A. Olivas,” an anthology published by Carolina Academic Press. In it, some 20 scholars analyze “pathbreaking” works by Olivas debating contemporary policy issues.
Juan F. Vasquez, Jr., a board member of the Hispanic Bar Association of Houston and an adjunct professor at the UH Law Center, said Olivas was a man of stature who will be “sorely missed,” with a legacy that “will live on at the University of Houston Law Center and the local, regional, national, and international community.”
He was “a giant in the legal industry… He left a legacy through the students he guided and the individuals and clients whose lives were positively impacted by his amazing legal work, scholarship, and mentorship,” said Vasquez.
Olivas was remembered on social media platforms as a generous friend, a mentor, a gentleman and a man for all seasons with a sharp sense of humor. They said he did not hesitate to provide incisive criticism to mentees, demanding the highest levels of research and professional quality.
“Wherefore art thou padrino (godfather), Who cared well for his flock. From few we grew manifold, Behold our great stock,” reads a ballad written by Juan F. Perea, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago.
“Michael stands out as a giant, a true hero,” Perea said. “I am grateful to have shared his friendship, his wisdom, his mentoring, his generosity, his learning, and his wit.”
A Mass will be held Saturday for Olivas at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is expected to offer a eulogy, the Chronicle has learned.
A space at UH’s new O’Quinn Law Building will be named the Olivas-Reyes Reading Room in honor of Olivas and his wife, retired Professor Emerita Augustina H. Reyes, a project that was announced before his death.
Scholars around the country are planning other projects, including the first Annual Michael Olivas Writing Institute, to take place virtually, and renaming an annual event from the Association of American Law School as the Michael Olivas Annual AALS Dinner.
“He was like a rock; when everything all around seem to be going crazy, he held everyone together,” said Raul Ramos, a history professor at UH. “I have never met anybody so dedicated to the selfless act of helping the community as Michael… His work will inspire the future” in academia."

UH students worked on a ‘revolutionary’ project about Houston’s Jewish Latinos
By Olivia P. Tallet

Bill Orlin talks about his time in the military, as he touches a patch from an infantry unit he trained with, after a Yom HaShoah ceremony for Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, April 24, 2022, at Congregation Beth Israel in Houston. Orlin is a Holocaust survivor and American veteran who served as an occupier in Germany after World War II. He said he wants to make sure that people know the Holocaust happened.
Dr. Lucy Graubard recently welcomed two students from the University of Houston to her home with a surprise.
“She made us bourekas, which was pretty amazing!” said one of the students, Miranda Ruzinsky, about the baked pastry that is very popular in the Sephardic Jewish gastronomy. She added that Graubard's food offering couldn’t have been more effective to break the ice for the specific purpose that brought them to her house.
Ruzinsky and her classmate Carla Peterson Mora were part of a group of 16 University of Houston students participating in the “Sephardic Latinx Oral History Project” documenting histories of Latinos with that Jewish background in collaboration with the Holocaust Museum Houston, which on Monday launched a public display of the project.
The project, directed by Mark Goldberg, a history professor at the university and director of the UH Jewish Studies Program, aimed to shed light on often overlooked communities in the intersection of being Latinos and Jewish, two heritages that many people don’t associate, he said.
“This is a typical American story in that this is a migration story,” Goldberg said. “It's about preserving culture after migration and its complex dynamics, and I think this would speak to all people, not just Latinos, or Jews, or Jewish Latinos.”
Goldberg said that these cultural interconnections have rarely been studied in the U.S. and doing so in Houston was of particular importance.
“Being in Houston, which is a global, diverse (city), I thought it was important to show the different ways of being Latino, and also, the different ways of being Jewish,” said Goldberg.
The professor said that the number of Latino Sephardic Jews in Houston is unknown as there is a scarcity of studies looking at Hispanic Jews. But he added that a survey from the American Jewish Committee published in 2015 identified between 130,000 and 227,000 Latino Jews in the U.S., although it didn’t identify if they were Sephardic, Ashkenazy, or other Jewish diversities.
The project focused on the Sephardic Jews who typically descended from 13th-century Jewish populations that resided in the Iberian Peninsula before their expulsion by Spanish and Portuguese royalty. Likewise, many Latinos in Houston and the U.S. share ancestry roots in that region.
During the project, the students learned the history and customs of Jewish communities and how they settled in Latin America before migrating to the U.S. They tracked 16 Sephardic Jewish in Houston who immigrated from Latin America for the project and documented their stories in oral history videos.
Ruzinsky and Peterson Mora documented the story of Graubard, who is a pediatrician practicing in northwest Houston. She is a Sephardi Jew but also has Ashkenazy heritage from one of her parents.
Ruzinsky said she realized during the interview that the bourekas and both Jewish and Hispanic heritage food were important for Graubard to preserve her traditions.
“I think it was something that meant so much to her; the way that her face lit up when she talked about it,” the student said. “I think that (food) was the way of her family for expressing their Jewishness and Latin heritage; an expression of love and community in their social interactions.”
For the Holocaust Museum, this project is part of its Latino Initiative Program created six years ago, which has presented exhibits such as “Bittersweet Harvest: The Bracero Program” in 2017 and “Withstand: Latinx Art in Times of Conflict” last year, among other programs.
This project “is particularly important to the museum because Latinx history and Jewish history are interconnected,” said Laurie Garcia, senior associate director of education at the Holocaust Museum. “We’re thrilled to be able to host this (…) to show how these histories and interwoven together.”
Garcia said that after launching the project Monday at the museum, the institution will use its growing Latino archive to host bilingual school programs, student and teacher workshops, and other initiatives. She said the museum hopes teachers would identify this oral history project as a potential educational resource to incorporate into their classrooms. The project, including its numerouns oral history videos, is hosted at hmh.org/SephardicLatinx.
For the University of Houston students in Goldberg's history class, the project provided a unique experience.
“Sitting down with a person, asking questions, and listening to their stories is critical for historians,” said Goldberg. “I thought this would be an outstanding experience for our students.”
Student Ruzinsky said the Latino-Jewish intersection wasn’t something new to her.
“I am Jewish!... and I am Latina” too. “I grew up going to religious school, I had my Bar Mitzvah (and) I'm part of the Jewish Houston Young Professionals group.”
Ruzinsky said she was born in Houston to a Catholic Hispanic mother who converted to Judaism when she married her Ashkenazy father. “I learned a lot about the history of Judaism beyond the Ashkenazi traditions.”
However, something was new to Ruzinsky.
“I learned a lot about the procedure of doing oral history from a mindful, compassionate way, and the open-mindedness that one needs to have when dealing with human subjects, Ruzinsky said. “We learned that a lot of the times people are socially conditioned to believe that their stories are not special enough or that they are not really part of history. But having people recount their lives or their families'… brings certain realizations of uniqueness and specialness that I feel was important.”
Ruzinsky said she valued that the project focused on those heritage intersections and found exceptional the opportunity to participate in an educational initiative hosted by the museum.
“I thought this experience was pretty revolutionary,” she said."
