Kansas City LGBTQ advocate on ‘white fragility,’ latinx and finding support
By Cindy Hoedel

Documentary filmmaker Randall Jenson, 32,RandallJenson.com, of Kansas City received a 2016 Rocket Grant from the Charlotte Street Foundation for an online video project by SocialScope Productions. The video campaign will present uplifting messages from transgender and nongendered (TGNC) youth. Jenson also started a support group for TGNC youth; find information at trans.report/tgncyouth. Jenson was raised in Lake St. Louis, and was kicked out of the house at 17 when he came out as gay. He completed high school while living in shelters and couch-surfing and was offered a full-ride scholarship by DePaul University, where he earned a bachelor of arts in women and gender studies and anthropology with a minor in LGBT studies. Jenson returned to St. Louis to work as an LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) activist before being recruited to Kansas City in 2014. Jenson works nationally as well as locally on anti-violence initiatives and youth advocacy, appearing on “Oprah” in 2006 and writing articles in publications such as Out.
This conversation took place on the balcony of his home and studio in midtown. Q: What has been the response among Kansas City’s LGBTQ community to the (June 12) mass killing at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando?
A: Unfortunately there have been instances of appropriation of the massacre. We are not Orlando and using “WeAreOrlando” hashtags is completely wrong and it erases the violence that happened there. There have been instances of white LGBTQ people in Kansas City making it about themselves. That is called “white fragility.” Q: What does “white fragility” mean? A: It’s where white LGBT folks say, “I feel unsafe now walking outside,” when, if we look at what happened in Orlando, if it was a hate crime against LGBTQ people, it was also absolutely a racist hate crime against a specific community, namely latinx (“la-teen-ex”) Puerto_Ricans. (Nearly half of those killed had Puerto_Rican ties, according to The Associated Press.) Q: What does “latinx” mean?
A: Latinx is an inclusive term that makes room for trans and nongendered people in Spanish, which is a gendered language. That was the targeted community in Orlando, and the latinx community in Kansas City is the community that needs to be heard from, particularly when they have been the target of violence here and murder, in the case of Tamara Dominguez. Q: What can people outside the latinx community do to help? A: If you are a donor, make sure the money is going to the community the organization says it is going to. Ask to see the books. Ask how often they check in with the clients they serve. Ask how involved the board is: Do they talk directly to staff and clients, or is everything filtered through the executive director? Ask to talk to the clients. It’s too easy to say, “Oh, I wrote that check. Oh, I got my photo with the rainbow filter.”
Being supportive requires action steps. It requires holding people accountable. Q: Who comes to your new support group for trans and nongender youth? A: We’ve had kids from as far away as Harrisonville, Missouri. We had 12-year-olds to 19-year-olds there. I would say the average age was about 13. Q: How did the 12-year-olds get there? A: Their parents brought them! So you have youth whose families have rejected them coming from shelters, and youth whose parents are fully accepting coming together. And a really cool thing that is happening is, some of the parents are staying and meeting in a separate room and basically forming a parent support group.
Q: Your parents were not supportive when you came out. Do you have contact with them now? A: No. I think the best thing for me was realizing that sometimes the parents we are given in this world just aren’t good parents. I made the choice to accept that this is who my mom is, but it doesn’t mean that I have to interact with her, and the same with my dad. I am privileged and lucky to have a lot of self-created family. It’s difficult at holidays and birthdays. At the Rocket Grant celebration, I didn’t have any official family there, but I had “family,” I had people who love me. Q: What is your vision for your Rocket Grant video project? A: Since trans people of color in Kansas City are at the epicenter of feeling unsafe, I want to lift up their voices. And the LGBTQ youth of color tell me they really want to hear from adults in that community who get it and who can teach them about appropriate boundaries.
My video campaign is not going to be the typical thing where trans kids talking about feeling unsafe or sad. Those stories are important, but I’m going to focus people feeling strong and wise and how they are surviving and thriving."

By Steve Rothaus

Liberal and LGBT activists are condemning Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his former adversary, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, for planning to speak at an “anti-LGBTQ” conference of 700 conservative pastors and spouses later this week in Orlando — exactly two months after the Pulse Nightclub shooting. From Bloomberg News: Trump’s central appeal on the campaign trail to religious conservatives is his promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment, an IRS rule that prohibits churches from using their tax-exempt resources to promote political candidates. “That’s a good first step,” said David Lane, the American Renewal Project’s founder. “But what about the religious liberty of Christian photographers, Christian bakers, Christian retreat centers, and pastors who believe same-sex intercourse and marriage is sin? These Christians were simply living out their deeply held convictions of their Christian faith when they politely refused to provide services for a same-sex wedding. Doesn’t the First Amendment give us all a right to our beliefs?” Lane added: “Homosexual totalitarianism is out of the closet, the militants are trying herd Christians there.”
“Holding this event is an insult to the victims and families of those innocent people who were murdered barely two months ago. Decent people everywhere will be appalled. Stirring up homophobia and islamophobia is wrong at the best of times but to do so when the entire Orlando community is still grieving and recovering from the Pulse tragedy, is beyond distasteful. Donald Trump may have mentioned the LGBTQ community in his acceptance speech which some people interpreted as a positive signal to our community — despite the vehemently anti-LGBTQ views of his running mate Mike Pence and the Republican Party platform. But now Donald Trump and Marco Rubio plan to breathe the oxygen of publicity into an openly anti-LGBTQ event, joining some of the most notorious anti-LGBTQ people out there. Haven’t the people of Orlando had enough?” said Russell Roybal, deputy executive director of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, in a news release Tuesday. Rubio’s Senate reelection campaign on Wednesday provided a statement to the Miami Herald denying the American Renewal Project event will be anti-LGBT. “The event I will be speaking at in Orlando is a gathering of local pastors and faith leaders. Leave it to the media and liberal activists to label a gathering of faith leaders as an anti-LGBT event. It is nothing of the sort. It is a celebration of faith,” Rubio said in the statement. “Because I believe that a strong America is not possible without strong families and strong values, for years now I have participated in events hosted by faith leaders to speak about the cultural and social issues before America, including the importance of parents and families, religious liberties and combatting poverty.” Rubio also said he still disagrees with the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision that same-sex couples have a Constitutional right to marry. “I have always supported a traditional definition of marriage. But I recognize that a significant number of Americans hold a different view. Because marriage is regulated by the individual states, they have the right to petition their state legislature to change the law. And those of us who support traditional marriage also have a right to oppose those efforts,” he said. “This debate should be conducted in a way that is respectful of the views and the dignity of those on both sides. That is the way I have expressed myself each time I have been asked to opine on this issue. And that is how I intend to continue to do so.”
The Task Force and other groups say Rubio and Trump will be speaking at the American Renewal Project conference alongside many religious and political figures well-known in the anti-LGBT rights movement. “Among the speakers expected at the event include: Mat Staver, who has represented Kim Davis and Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore and has denounced memorial gatherings for the victims of the Orlando massacre as ‘homosexual love fests;’ David Barton, an anti-LGBTQ extremist who thinks HIV/AIDS is a ‘divine penalty;’ Maine pastor Ken Graves who claims that LGBTQ people can’t raise happy families because they are ‘depressed;’ and David Lane who believes that basic rights for LGBTQ people will lead to ‘utter destruction’ and ‘car bombs in Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Des Moines,’” according to a Task Force news release. Michael Keegan, president of People For the American Way, said in a statement “that the GOP standard bearer is choosing to rub shoulders with some of the most extreme anti-gay voices in the country speaks volumes about the Republican party today. “These are people who revile gay people, calling them ‘demonic,’ and who claim that LGBT rights will lead to the ‘utter destruction’ of our country. But the GOP presidential candidate seemingly has no qualms about casting his lot with these dangerous anti-gay voices,” said Keegan, whose group was the first to report that Rubio would speak at the Orlando event. Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation’s largest LGBT political group, also weighed in: “Just when you think Donald Trump and Marco Rubio couldn’t go any lower, they announce plans to court anti-LGBTQ activists in Orlando. On Thursday, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio are going to seek votes from people who fundamentally believe we are not equal, who support dangerous and harmful conversion therapy and who have worked to export anti-LGBTQ hate abroad,” said HRC Senior Vice President of Policy and Political Affairs JoDee Winterhof. “Donald Trump would put at risk all the progress the LGBTQ community has made over the last eight years. And we know all too well that Marco Rubio -- who has refused to stand up for LGBTQ Floridians time and again -- would be his loyal accomplice. Because of elected officials like Marco Rubio, LGBTQ Floridians remain at risk of being fired or denied a job because of who they are or whom they love.”
Equality Florida announced Tuesday that activists from that group, the GLBT Center of Central Florida, Organize Now!, The Pride Fund to End Gun Violence, Human Link for Pulse, PFLAG - Orlando, Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida would protest the American Renewal Project event. From Equality Florida: “On the eve of the two-month anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub massacre, presidential candidate Donald Trump will join U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio at a radical anti-LGBTQ event in Orlando. Equality Florida, joined by community partners and individuals directly impacted by the shooting, will gather Thursday, Aug. 11, for a peaceful rally and press conference to demand an end to the hate and violence perpetuated by Donald Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio, and the religious extremists responsible for the event.” O​pen Letter From Florida LGBT Leaders Calling on Marco Rubio ​to Not Attend Anti-LGBT Rally Dear Senator Rubio, Two months ago, the single largest mass shooting in American history occurred in Orlando, targeting the LGBT and Latinx community. LGBT Americans have overcome unimaginable obstacles in their fight for equal rights in this country, and the immense weight of this tragedy will have a profound impact. In response to the Pulse attack, you focused on how to launch your reelection campaign rather than how you could help your LGBT constituents and their families. Now, as the two month anniversary of the tragedy approaches, you’ve chosen to commemorate the date by speaking at an Orlando rally that opposes equal rights for LGBT Americans. Senator Rubio, your presence as a guest of honor at a conference featuring vehemently anti-LGBT organizations and speakers legitimizes their discriminatory efforts to deny equal rights to all Americans. Your decision to stand with those who would deny us equality after refusing to stand with your LGBT constituents adds insult to injury.
In the wake of the Pulse shooting, the need for more love, tolerance, and inclusion has never been greater. Your choice to return to Orlando and lend your voice to those who stoke fear and division is unacceptable. As your constituents and members of Florida’s LGBT community, we urge you to act in the best interest of all Floridians and not attend this rally.
Signed,​ Terry Fleming, President of the Florida LGBTA Democratic Caucus Vivian Rodriguez, President of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida Carlos Guillermo Smith, former Orange County Democratic Executive Committee Chair Darden Rice,​ ​Vice Chair, St. Petersburg City Council."

Pulse hit the LGBTQ community of color hardest. One year later, it’s a struggle to heal.
By Alex Harris and Joey Flechas

One year ago, 49 lives were taken at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Fifty-three survivors — most LGBTQ — still bear physical scars. Thousands lost loved ones, friends or a sense of home. It may never be known whether the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history targeted Pulse on June 12, 2016, because it was an LGBTQ club filled with people of color. But that’s who he hurt the most, and the small, increasingly vocal community at the intersection of those identities want its stories to be known. For some people, the motive is less important than the pain. They want to be visible. But not like this. Not under the uncomfortable gaze of the international media, as victims or political pawns, but as whole persons. “We’ve been here all along,” said Nancy Rosado, an Orlando activist and expert in post-traumatic stress. “The community of color has been here all along.”
A Hispanic lesbian, she understands the struggle of feeling overlooked. Pastor Debreita “Brei” Taylor, the leader of a nondenominational Orlando church with a mission to welcome the LGBTQ community, nodded in her seat next to Rosado. She lamented the fact that the nine African Americans who were killed at Pulse typically received less attention than their white and Hispanic counterparts. “It’s never spoken about,” she said. “That is a continuation of erasing a community that says that we’re forever overlooked.” But they and their communities are finding support in one another. Since the massacre, this partnership has blossomed into nonprofits that provide much-needed mental healthcare, language classes and support groups that speak to the communities they serve. They’re doing their best to a build a safety net that never existed before. But there are still gaps.
Pulse was a home, a place where a diverse spectrum of people could feel comfortable. The black community feels it has been sidelined in the narrative of the attack and its fallout. Unmarried LGBTQ couples with families have trouble accessing benefits in a system that wasn’t built for their partnerships. And overall, the powers-that-be were ill-equipped to handle tragedy in the LGBTQ community of color. Some victims were outed because of Pulse. There were undocumented survivors who were scared to come forward afterward if it meant an FBI interview. Money set aside for victims got caught up in court arguments between biological and chosen families. “They never planned for us. They never planned to take care of us,” Rosado said. “And it cuts through down to the bone.” #WeExist or #OrlandoUnited? On a blisteringly sunny Thursday a few weeks before the one-year mark, a handful of mourners clustered at the memorial that dresses the chain link fence outside the shuttered Pulse nightclub. A short, black woman knelt below the collage of pictures, poems and messages to a bright yellow pot, one of 49 bordering the tarp shielding the wreckage of the club. She straightened the sagging succulent and turned the pot so the name on its rim was visible — Tevin Crosby. When Crosby’s mother wanted to know what happened to her son, she picked up the phone in North Carolina and dialed Charlotte “ChaCha” Davis in Orlando. Members of the black LGBTQ community in Orlando don’t have a nonprofit that caters to their culture. They have ChaCha.
“I’ve always been the crisis advocate,” Davis said. “I’ve been there for every funeral, every birth, every family emergency.” Davis worked as a club promoter in Orlando for more than a decade. She moved away a week before the shooting, but the day she got the call she came right back to her people. All of her possessions are still in a Fort Lauderdale storage unit. She stepped into the role of community advocate. She brought candles and bottled water to vigils. She consoled loved ones. She cooked their meals and planned memorial events. “It was like ‘ChaCha, ChaCha, ChaCha, ChaCha,’ ” she said, stomping her feet into the pavement. “I’ve been on the beat like this.” Davis is the person Emily Addison calls when her grief keeps her awake. Addison’s partner of seven years, Deonka Drayton, was killed in the shooting. They never legally married, and Addison said she never felt accepted by Drayton’s family. Although Addison may not have a marriage license, she carries a stack of papers — printed-out Instagram photos, doctor’s notes, rent checks and shared bills — that document their lives together. Even at the hospital, Addison had to show staff pictures of the couple on her phone to convince them to give her any information on Drayton. Only Drayton never made it to the hospital. She died inside Pulse. “I have been proving I was a part of someone’s life since that day,” Addison said. The OneOrlando fund, created by the city after the Pulse shooting, gave 308 people more than $31 million. Drayton’s family got its share for her death. Only a small amount went to Addison.
At her partner’s funeral, “I was treated like a stranger,” Addison said. As the one-year mark approaches, Addison’s grief is still fresh. She can’t stand the memories she feels driving down the same streets and walking into the same stores. She’s moving out of the city with her three children. “All these signs saying Orlando United and Orlando Strong just hurt me,” she said. “I feel like if you need to portray Orlando as united, then act like it.” The ubiquitous rainbow #OrlandoUnited rubs Davis the wrong way, too. She prefers her own hashtag — #WeExist. Davis and others in Orlando’s LGBTQ black community said they feel like “double minorities,” excluded from their racial community for their sexual orientation and from the larger LGBTQ community because of their race. “No one knows I’m gay until I tell them, but this,” Davis said, touching her arm, “is something I can’t deny.” Building new communities Etched forever in ink on his right forearm in their native Spanish, activist Ricardo Negron-Almodovar carries a quote from Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti. “Cuando los odios andan sueltos, uno ama en defensa propia.” When hatred runs loose, one loves in self-defense. Underneath, the peaks of an EKG line frame a heart with “6/12/16” in the middle, the date of the massacre. The date when he escaped with his life. The night he doesn’t discuss very much at all. “It is still, in some moments, mentally draining,” he said, sitting in a space he helped create to help others like him. He’s the director of Proyecto Somos Orlando, (Project We Are Orlando), a nonprofit center formed after Pulse that aims to serve the Latinx community with culturally sensitive services. This includes everything from counseling to support groups to English classes to HIV testing.
Somos Orlando seeks to fill part of that gap that was revealed after the massacre. The office in a nondescript building south of Orlando is one of the organizations that have formed to provide a space for the LGBTQ community of color, particularly the Latinx community. The term “Latinx” is a gender-neutral pronoun that replaces the male and female Spanish pronouns. It is meant to be more inclusive. A group called QLatinx meets every week at Somos Orlando to discuss issues in their community that no one else understands: the struggle of being undocumented and in the closet, the language barrier, the pain of holding back your identity from family — all obstacles amplified after the shooting. “You went through this horrible experience, and you can’t tell your family. Who are you supposed to tell?” Negron-Almodovar said. “You can’t tell your family that you moved here to give a better life to them back home, but you can’t tell them that you went through this, because you can’t tell them you’re gay.”
The group recently convened to talk about self-care, a timely issue as the anniversary of the shooting looms large. The rainbows, memorials and emotional Facebook posts can trigger a cascade of emotions. Christopher Cuevas, executive director of QLatinx, said his community was brought to the forefront after Pulse, but struggles to remain visible outside safe spaces like Somos Orlando. Sometimes, it’s even tough around family. “It’s also a journey of acceptance for the family,” he said. “That’s become an important part of the conversation.” In each other, they find a chosen family. But they wish they could feel just as comfortable in everyday life in Orlando. That sense of belonging feels distant for QLatinx attendees Sonia and Andrea Parra. Sonia started going to Pulse when she was in high school. When she got married, she danced there with her wife, Andrea, and she almost went on June 11 to celebrate a former coworker’s birthday. Her five coworkers — and two other friends — were killed early the next morning. Ever since the attack, they’ve felt the fault lines in their city. Neighbors who once smiled at the couple and wished them “good morning” went silent when the couple plastered their car with rainbow stickers in the wake of Pulse. Just a few weeks after the shooting, their daughter came running home in tears. A neighbor told her she wasn’t allowed to play with her son anymore — the same boy who got her a Frozen-themed jewelry box for her ninth birthday and came to every sleepover — because she had two moms. When Sonia marched down the street to confront the mother, her neighbor told her she “didn’t feel it was appropriate” for her son to be near “bad influences.” “Pulse opened up wounds,” Andrea Parra said. “It doesn’t feel safe.”
Starting the conversation In a modest warehouse development nestled in an industrial section of Orlando, Pastor Brei greeted a few dozen people at her church. Her crimson curls framed her warm expression as she welcomed those walking into Oasis Fellowship Ministries. After attendees took their seats, she explained the significance of the space she has created there. “We are intentionally inclusive,” she told he audience. “We are intentionally, on purpose, activists and advocates.” Her use of the collective “we” carried a special meaning that night. A panel of six local activists — white, black, Hispanic, straight, gay — had convened to discuss racism and discrimination in the LGBTQ community. Davis had invited the group to tackle the uncomfortable topic, sparking a nuanced conversation about how to recognize differences across communities, embrace their diversity and unify to support each other.
A panel theme was to get the world outside to recognize that they exist and that they want to be included. Panelist Kent Marrero, a Puerto_Rican Orlando resident who identifies outside of the gender binary (not specifically male or female), talked about the emerging conversations on the “queer experience.” Marrero prefers to be called “they” instead of “he” or “she.” Usually, Marrero identifies primarily as either Latinx or LGBTQ, depending on whom they are talking to. Marrero and other LGBTQ people of color are now beginning to talk about what it means to belong to multiple communities. “There’s been a shift in how we talk about ourselves. Specifically, that we talk about ourselves,” Marrero said in an interview with the Miami Herald. Concrete needs — mental healthcare, financial support, visibility — are still unmet for many in the LGBTQ community, but discourse is now a first step for people who feel left behind. Some panelists, like Tricia Duncan, founder of Orlando Black Pride, were skeptical of prioritizing talk over action. But she later said it opened her eyes and reminded her that the broader LGBTQ community of color does have allies — and they’re ready to get to work. “I needed to hear other people who aren’t black say ‘I hear you, and I’m with you,’ ” Duncan said. “I’m looking forward to where we can go.” McClatchy videographer Jessica Koscielniak contributed to this report."

We sang in Spanish, fell in love with ‘Coco’ — Latino culture trumped hate in 2017
By Fabiola Santiago

If you’re a Latino in America — or Latinx, the gender-neutral the younger generation prefers — the national landscape felt particularly brutal this year, the stinging divisive words of President Donald Trump ringing in our ears. No matter the political bent, there were days when so many of us wondered: Have we lost forever our beloved country to hate speech and hearts hardened by fear? The noise might make it seem that way. But in 2017, doors opened for Latinos where President Trump sought to build a wall — and, in the process, the Latino culture served as a bridge and uniting factor. The country sang in Spanish to the catchy rhythm of “Despacito” by Puerto_Ricans Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, “King of Reggaetón.” In Disney Pixar’s animated “Coco,” a cultural jewel voiced over by Latinx actors, a Mexican boy and his special guitar have become a box-office hit the last three weeks.
And in politics, Latinas made election history. “We’re breaking barriers down,” Fonsi told E-News earlier this year as he accumulated accolades and honors for a song that stayed at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for 16 weeks. “I think that’s the biggest win out of all this.” Indeed, the inspiring work of Latinos in the arts — and its recognition by mainstream America — was a soothing balm to Trump’s demonizing of immigrants, his making us the scapegoats for what ails the nation.
PolitiFact may have named Trump’s claim that the Russian election interference is “a made up story” 2017’s Lie of the Year, but his anti-immigrant crusade was equally packed with falsehoods and generalizations that sought to diminish immigrants in order to push his draconian policies on suffering communities vulnerable to populist demagoguery. These lies were replicated in the voice of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. But despite the disrespecting rhetoric from Washington, Latinos were big contributors — and winners, in politics, too. In Virginia, two Democrats, Elizabeth Guzman and Hala Ayala, defeated Republican incumbents to become the state’s first Latinas elected to the House of Delegates. In California, Cathy Murillo was elected the first Latina mayor of Santa Barbara. In Miami-Dade, Colombian-American Annette Taddeo became the first Latina Democrat elected to the Florida Senate. That it hadn’t happened before in Florida’s largest and most Hispanic county speaks of the rise of an underrepresented, non-Republican Hispanic class to the political sphere — a long overdue, necessary and positive development. As for what Americans most consume — pop culture — “Despacito,” which won several Latin Grammys, is nominated in the categories of record of the year, song of the year and best pop duo performance at the upcoming Grammys. “Coco,” which first debuted in Mexico to record-breaking attendance, has become more than just a money-maker, grossing $135.5 million at home and $250 million internationally, and earning Golden Globe nominations for best animated film and best song for “Remember Me” by songwriters Robert Lopez and wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez. The lovely story’s showcase of traditions and values Mexicans hold dear is in direct contradiction to Trump’s stereotyping of Mexican immigrants as criminals. Although they confirm it with scholarship, I don’t need research studies to tell me that hate begets hate. I see it everyday in the headlines of bullied kids who commit suicide, of mosques, churches, and synagogues attacked — and a Congress that fails to find a legislative solution for undocumented “Dreamers” at risk of deportation, opting by default to act in complicity with the anti-immigrant president.
While there are still many barriers to knock down, Latinos have shown that the antidote to hate is hard, focused work that proves the haters wrong and contributes to the cultural and political tapestry of the place we call home. The success of Latinos makes America great, always has been that way. They hate, we unite — and shine."

This group is pushing for more black political representation through a 'Black Census'
By Jacob Sweet

A group that has been surveying thousands of African Americans is expanding the project, hoping to reach 200,000 people in a push for greater political representation for black communities. The group responsible for the project, Black Futures Lab, started reaching out to black Americans in February. So far, they have collected 7,600 responses to the survey, called the Black Census Project. As they reach more people, they will give the data to elected officials with the goal of better tailoring policies to interests in African American communities. “I think oftentimes when people think of who is black in America, they think about those who are descendants of slaves,” said Alicia Garza, co-founder of both BFL and Black Lives Matter. “But I think it’s important to understand that’s a very unique part of the population.”
Last week, BFL released a version of the survey in Spanish in an effort to reach out Afro-Latino Americans. They worked with Mijente, a which calls itself a Latinx political organization. The group uses the word “Latinx,” — pronounced La-teen-ex — as a gender-neutral form of the word Latino. The goal of the collaboration is to reach a swath of black Americans who are not typically thought of as a part of the black community. “For the over 1.2 million Afro-Latinx people in this country, this survey provides them with a megaphone they are rarely given,” Mijente cofounder Marisa Franco said. “Providing an outlet to detail which issues matter most to them gives us a better understanding of what it means to be black in America.” Black Americans — from descendants of American slavery to those from Haiti, Guatemala or Puerto_Rico — are lumped into one homogenous group, Garza says. This thinking, she believes, leads politicians to treat black Americans as one voting bloc, making them less likely to consider different needs within black communities. “Because our communities are misunderstood and misrepresented, that means we’re misunderstood and misrepresented in politics as well,” Garza said.
Garza hopes that by translating the survey to Spanish, BFL will get closer to their goal of 200,000 respondents. The group also has plans to translate their survey into six more languages spoken by black Americans, including French Creole, Haitian Creole and Somali. In Miami, a city with large Afro-Latino and Haitian communities, this could mean more survey takers and more data. Garza emphasized that the Black Census Project is not meant as an alternative to the 2020 U.S. Census, which she said is key to distributing resources to black communities.It is something supplemental that will give officials a more nuanced view of black life. She mentioned questions about sexual orientation and gender identity as subjects that the U.S. Census would not bring up, but that the Black Census would. The survey takes about 15 minutes to complete. Towards the beginning, it asks survey-takers whether they identify as Black, African, Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean, African-American or other. Another questions asks readers about their level of favorability to certain people or groups, including Barack Obama, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, President Donald Trump, and Black Lives Matter. It also asks respondents to suggest ways to improve relations between black communities and the police. Once the survey reaches 200,000 people, Garza said the BFL will launch a policy group called “Black to the Future.” Using the collected data, the group would craft policies and meet with elected officials, turning data into action. “From our perspective, we’re just getting started,” Garza said."

South Florida becomes breeding ground for new works, playwrights 
By Christine Dolen

If it’s autumn, it’s time for the new South Florida theater season to kick into high gear. And among more than a dozen regionally produced shows opening this month in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties are two world premieres: Michael McKeever’s #MeToo-influenced take on the horror classic “Dracula,” for Zoetic Stage at Miami’s Arsht Center, and the Broadway-targeted “Havana Music Hall,” which is getting a lavish first production at Actors’ Playhouse in Coral Gables’ Miracle Theatre.
With music and lyrics by Richard Kagan, a producer-composer based in Los Angeles, and a book by Miami playwright-actor Carmen Peláez (whose new play “Fake” will get its own world premiere from Miami New Drama in January-February), “Havana Music Hall” is having an extended preview period Oct. 10-18 before its gala opening Oct. 19. The poignant, resonant piece about married Cuban performers whose lives are upended by the revolution had an earlier workshop presentation in Los Angeles, but close-to-Cuba Miami seemed the perfect spot for its world premiere. As with several other New York-aspiring productions at Actors’ Playhouse in the past, the show is the work of a largely out-of-town creative team; director-choreographer Maria Torres, for example, was associate choreographer of Broadway’s “On Your Feet!” and the choreographer of Off-Broadway’s “4 Guys Named Jose and Una Mujer Named Maria.” And the cast is a blend of New York-based actors (many with Miami roots) and area performers.
McKeever’s “Dracula,” on the other hand, has pure South Florida running through its veins. The playwright, whose Carbonell Award-winning “Daniel’s Husband” opens at Off-Broadway’s Westside Theatre Upstairs a week after “Dracula” begins artfully terrorizing audiences in the Arsht’s Carnival Studio Theater on Oct. 11, is among three Miami playwrights whose work is in the national spotlight this season.
Christopher Demos-Brown, like McKeever one of the founders of Zoetic, is making his Broadway debut with “American Son;” starring Kerry Washington and directed by Tony Award winner Kenny Leon, the play opens at the Booth Theatre on Nov. 4. On Jan. 10, “Moonlight” Oscar winner Tarell Alvin McCraney makes his Broadway debut at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre with “Choir Boy,” an Off-Broadway hit that was subsequently produced at GableStage in 2015. Stuart Meltzer, artistic director and another Zoetic Stage founder, says of McKeever and Demos-Brown, “You work at it and the doors open up. And they write good plays.”
The play-writing landscape in the region has changed since trailblazer Nilo Cruz won the Pulitzer Prize for drama for “Anna in the Tropics,” which had its world premiere at tiny New Theatre in 2002. (Cruz, too, will have a presence in New York this season when his Spanish-language “Exquisita Agonía” rejoins the repertory after its world premiere last spring at Repertorio Español; the play will also be presented by Arca Images production at Miami-Dade County Auditorium’s On.Stage Black Box Nov. 15-18.) Given the success of these breakout playwrights, initiatives such as the Playwright Development Program run by the Miami-Dade Department of Cultural Affairs, and developmental programs including Palm Beach Dramaworks’ Dramaworkshop in West Palm Beach, Theatre Lab at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Jan McArt’s New Play Readings series at Boca Raton’s Lynn University and Miami Light Project’s Here & Now Festival, it’s clear that South Florida has become a place where new work — and playwrights — can flourish.
Juan C. Sanchez, for example, is putting the finishing touches on the second edition of Juggerknot Theatre Company’s immersive “Miami Motel Stories,” which will run at a Biscayne Corridor motel Nov. 30-Dec. 23. And three of Miami New Drama’s four productions at the Colony Theatre on Miami Beach this season are world premieres. Says Carbonell Award-winning actor Karen Stephens, who plays a decidedly different Van Helsing in “Dracula,” “South Florida is fecund, a fertile place for new work, a breeding ground for original works.” McKeever, whose script for “Dracula” is his 30th full-length play since his 1996 debut with “That Sound You Hear” at New Theatre, has seen a significant evolution for the region’s playwrights since his career began. “The world has changed for playwrights here, more specifically in the last seven years or so,” he says. “Not only are new works a normal part of the landscape, but they’ve been embraced by artistic directors and audiences. People want them.” “Dracula,” for which McKeever also designed the tri-level set, has been percolating in his imagination for five years or so. But the #MeToo movement gave him fresh ideas about how to approach the Bram Stoker vampire classic. “Dracula is the ultimate predator,” McKeever says. “But I wanted to redefine things. What better way to turn the play on its head and empower the women? Now Van Helsing is a woman of color, a Johannesburg-born scientist with this great strength and resolve. The character of Mina Murray was set up to be a victim, but here she starts off talking about equal rights and finds her confidence. It’s really Mina’s play.” In “Dracula,” Meltzer is directing a cast that includes Carlos Orizondo as Dracula, Lindsey Corey as Mina, Daniel Capote as Mina’s fiancé Jonathan Harker, David Kwiat as Dr. Edmond Seward, Isabella Lopez as Seward’s ward Lucy (and as the maid Bridgett), Caleb Scott as the disturbed Renfield and Stephens as Van Helsing. The director is savoring his first-ever experience at directing a horror classic with so many thematic colors.
“I want to play with light and sound, so there’s an almost continuous soundscape that will get the audience into a hypnotic state,” says Meltzer, who is working with lighting designer Rebecca Montero and sound designer Matt Corey. “Then it wakes you up, and there’s blood spurting everywhere. This is gothic, comedy, drama and horror, all larger than life. You need a balance.” Orizondo, who teaches drama at Gulliver Academy, has gone beyond research (reading Stoker’s novel, watching “Dracula”-related movies) to physically transform himself for his Zoetic debut. The slim, muscular actor grew his hair longer, pierced his ear and deliberately lost 20 pounds on a ketogenic diet. “Dracula is the essence of the id. I see him as a tall, thin man – a wolf, an animal,” Orizondo says. “He’s the ultimate predator and ultimate egotist. It’s all about satisfying his urges. He has no boundaries.”
Kwiat, who quips that he’s “enjoying sinking my teeth into the horror genre,” is impressed by McKeever’s reimagining of a familiar story. “He took the bulk of the material and turned it into his own entity. He knows the audience knows the story,” the actor says. “Michael is truly a renaissance man. He’s a writer, a designer, a manager, an artist….As a writer, he rolls around in so many genres. He’s a chameleon who takes on the hues of whatever he’s working on….It’s a joy to watch his writing get deeper and deeper.” Corey, who graduated from Miami’s New World School of the Arts a decade ago, said yes to playing Mina before she had seen a word of the script. This is her first McKeever play but her third world premiere, after playing leads in Kim Ehly’s “Baby Girl” and Demos-Brown’s “Stripped.” “It’s rare when a man writes a play like this about women,” Corey says. “He’s really mapped out her journey, which includes heartbreak and the promise of a different life. He has such a grasp of how people talk to each other. In a period piece, you can get lost in the language, but he writes so it’s a natural flow.” Stephens, who also appeared in McKeever’s Zoetic world premiere drama “After,” concurs regarding the playwright’s skills. “He does his research, and the way he constructs the language of a piece is a strong point,” she says. “Whether it’s a comedy or a drama, he has an ear for the rhythms of language and a facility for moving the story along to its conclusion.” In “Havana Music Hall,” a story devised by Kagan was turned into a script packed with joy, tension and loss by Peláez, author and performer of the successful solo show “Rum & Coke.” Set in Havana in 1958 and in the present, the musical is a love letter to Cuban music and musicians, as well as a heartbreaking examination of the personal toll exacted by the revolution. Here, director-choreographer Torres is the artist who keeps the absorbing story moving along to its conclusion.
“This musical is about love, hope and redemption,” says Torres of a show that features more than 30 characters. “I wanted to create something seamless … to feel the story’s coming from everywhere…to immerse the audience and make them feel they’ve traveled to Cuba in 1958, then to present-day Cuba.” Kagan, a longtime friend and professional associate of the late composer Marvin Hamlisch, says he has loved Latin music from an early age and that the “Buena Vista Social Club” documentary affected him deeply. He took piano lessons from a Cuban musician. And when he met Cuban performer-musicologist Jose “Perico” Hernandez, who has translated lyrics and been part of the creative team for four years, Kagan knew his “Havana Music Hall” story rang true. “Jose told me that in 1958 he was working at the Capri Hotel in Havana, making $20 a week to support his wife and three kids. The regime came in and said, ‘We’ll tell you what to play and how much you can make,’” Kagan says. “The first part is a story of what happened. Then the core of the musical is everyone singing together. This is an old-fashioned musical. It has songs you’ll walk out humming.”
Larry Blank, a Tony Award-nominated orchestrator and the show’s music supervisor, was drawn to “Havana Music Hall” because he saw it as a musical about “roots, displacement, home and family. … To me, it’s a basic ‘Fiddler on the Roof.’” Two sets of actors play the musical’s focal couple, married musicians Rolando and Ramona Calderón. Owners of the late-night spot Havana Music Hall and parents of a baby daughter, they’re about to break through with a gig at the famed Tropicana when the revolution changes everything and they must choose exile or the cost of staying in their homeland. Alexander Pimental, a Miamian who now lives in Los Angeles, plays the younger Rolando. John Herrera, who played Daddy Warbucks in “Annie” at Actors’ Playhouse and who came to the United States from Cuba when he was 6, is the older Rolando. Linedy Genao, who appeared on Broadway in the Gloria and Emilio Estefan bio musical “On Your Feet!,” is younger Ramona. Miami native Isbelia Duran, the older version of Ramona, says she and Genao have found “situations in which we can mirror each other. The common connection is love.” Havana 2.jpg
Other than Herrera, the leads in this large Latinx cast have family roots in the Dominican_Republic. But, says Genao, “you don’t have to be Cuban to feel this music in your heart and soul. The message is: Never forget where you came from.” Observes David Arisco, the Actors’ Playhouse artistic director who previously worked with Torres on the company’s production of “Four Guys Named Jose,” “Obviously it’s a Cuban show. But so many families have been torn apart through exile and immigration throughout our entire audience base. The main message I saw in the piece is what happens when governments intervene and hope is torn apart, families are torn apart, musicians and artists are unable to do their work. And somehow, through it all, we find the chance at some later point for families to reunite, hope to be restored and the potential for a new future for the younger generation.” Herrera has been sharing his fragmented memories of Cuba with his fellow actors, savoring the chance to originate a role in a world premiere he sees as a testament to the triumph of the human spirit. “There is nothing like being part of a new show,” he says. Adds Pimental, “We’re in the place where we should be to test out a show like this.”"

Transgender women with HIV struggle to get competent healthcare in South Florida
By Joey Flechas

Imagine being identified by the wrong gender in the lobby of your own doctor’s office, or having trouble finding a job, or being rejected by your own family, because you are a transgender person. These situations complicate an already difficult daily experience for trans people, and they increase the risk of HIV among an already vulnerable population in South Florida, according to a new study by Human Rights Watch. The research focused on transgender women living with HIV, who face discrimination and lack of access to proper healthcare in Miami-Dade and Broward counties — despite significant government funding for medication and services. The findings reveal troubling shortcomings in the healthcare systems that are meant to serve marginalized communities — insufficient cultural sensitivity training for medical employees, inadequate data collection to measure HIV’s impact on the transgender community and barriers that make it harder for people to get their medications. At an event in South Beach to announce the release of the report Tuesday, researcher Megan McLemore said a yearlong study examined what federal, state and local governments and healthcare agencies are doing to provide adequate healthcare to transgender women. “We found a lot of talk, a lot of plans, a lot of strategy documents, a lot of proposals, a lot of hand-wringing, a lot of expressions of concern,” McLemore said to an audience gathered at the Betsy Hotel. “But we asked, ‘Is this translating into policy and services on the ground? Are trans women getting the healthcare and help that they need?’ And the answer was no.”
The Human Rights Watch report is based on questionnaires from 125 transgender women and more than 100 interviews with advocates, healthcare providers and government officials in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The research pointed to widespread issues with transgender women feeling uncomfortable or harassed at their healthcare providers. In some cases, patients were not identified by the correct gender at their own doctor’s office, causing people embarrassment that deterred them from returning. The report, titled “Living at Risk: Transgender Women, HIV, and Human Rights in South Florida,” opens with a telling anecdote from one of the survey respondents. (Respondents were kept anonymous.) “This woman shouted for ‘Kevin’ to come to the desk. I shrunk in my seat, hoping she would see the note on the chart about my gender change. But she just kept yelling for Kevin. I finally had to get up and cross the room in a walk of shame,” said a 31-year-old Miami resident. “Will I ever go back there? No way.” McLemore concluded that too few clinics in South Florida provide an acceptable standard of care for trans women in an environment where the patients truly feel welcome and respected.
“I used to go to Jackson hospital, but I haven’t been there in over a year,” said one 65-year-old survey respondent. “They are terrible. Not knowledgeable about trans health. They misgendered me. I don’t feel comfortable or trust them.”
Of those trans women surveyed, 45 percent had no health insurance. Of those who had health insurance, 39 percent had Medicaid and 23 percent reported having private insurance. More than 63 percent reported income of less than $10,000 a year, and more than half were unemployed. Survey respondents’ stories and statistics underscore an overall hostile environment for transgender women who face discrimination in the workplace and in healthcare settings, the report states. Other trends compound the issue, including a high rate of incarceration among trans women — a result of many turning to sex work as a means to make ends meet. Factoring in efforts from President Donald Trump’s administration to eliminate protections for transgender people, McLemore concluded that the plight facing transgender women in South Florida is a public health crisis compounding the HIV crisis. “This is an environment of risk for HIV that endangers their lives and their health every day,” she said. The South Florida report comes at a sensitive time. Nationwide, transgender people fear the repercussions of a White House that wants to eliminate recognition of people who identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. The Trump administration has launched an effort to define gender as a biological, unchangeable condition determined by genitalia, an initiative reported by The New York Times in October. The Human Rights Watch report was also timed to a day of significance for the transgender community. It marked the International Day of Transgender Remembrance, a day to honor the memory of people who have been murdered as a result of transphobia. On Monday, Human Rights Watch released a separate report on violence against transgender people, examining the circumstances around the killing of 22 transgender people in the U.S. since the beginning of 2018. McLemore’s report identified a key problem with far-reaching consequences: the lack of quality data on HIV infections in the transgender community. Sound data is crucial not only for understanding the breadth of the issue but also for securing government funding that relies on hard numbers. The Centers for Disease Control has issued guidelines to the states for how to collect such data, but the states are not closely monitored. “There’s no enforcement. It’s not a legal requirement. So states are implementing that at their own pace. And Florida has partially implemented it,” McLemore said. “It has gotten better. There is more transgender data than there used to be, but in doing this report HIV officials in Florida acknowledged that their data is incomplete and inaccurate still.” June Romero, a community advocate and trans actress who attended Tuesday’s event, said she was not surprised by the report’s findings, but has hope that the report will spark action.
“I’m incredibly relieved and I’m hopeful that the Human Rights Watch is dedicating their resources to such a report, and I hope that it’s a catalyst for a really important and necessary change,” she said. McLemore and her team worked with community organizations to connect with people who would participate in the survey. Members of those groups formed a panel convened Tuesday to discuss the findings of the report. For Arianna Lint, a trans woman and CEO of a community-based organization, Arianna’s Center, the survey data can serve as a basis for grant applications to aid her group’s mission to connect people with social and medical services. Her group specializes in helping members of the LatinX transgender community. The term “LatinX” is a gender-neutral pronoun that replaces the male and female Spanish pronouns. It is meant to be more inclusive.
Other panel members highlighted the importance of training for all workplaces to make transgender people feel comfortable and accepted. Morgan Mayfaire, co-founder and CEO of TransSOCIAL, said his group specializes in cultural sensitivity training. A transgender man, Mayfaire said the training is fun, based on respect, and necessary to avoid situations where people refer to others by the wrong gender. Being misgendered, particularly in a medical office, can discourage someone from coming back. “It’s a slap in the face. It takes away your dignity, and it takes away who you are,” Mayfaire said. McLemore outlined several steps that all levels of government can take to protect the rights of transgender people and members of the broader LGBTQ community. Apart from federal policy changes that increase access to healthcare, she suggested state and local authorities follow federal guidelines for collecting HIV data from transgender patients. Another major recommendation: ensuring coverage of hormone replacement therapy in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program and making sure people are aware of its availability. Under a model for care accepted by experts, providers who prescribe HIV medication are encouraged to also offer hormone replacement therapy to transgender patients. Studies show hormone replacement therapy, a common treatment used by transgender people who are transitioning, has positive physical and psychological effects that help people align their bodies more closely to their gender identities. McLemore said more clinics who offer HIV treatment should be prepared to offer hormone replacement therapy for the ease and convenience of their patients. Some already do. Sheryl Zayas, a doctor at Care Resource Community Health Center in Fort Lauderdale, is noted in the report as a proponent for bundling the services, arguing that offering hormone replacement therapy is “essential” for keeping people in care. “HIV doctors can do this, and it’s extremely important they do,” McLemore said. “If they don’t, they’re not effectively treating trans women who are living with HIV.” Read the full report below."

TRANSART show to spotlight works of transgender artists 
By Christina Mayo

Since 2002, Unity Coalition|Coalición Unida has been advancing equality and fairness through education, leadership and awareness for the Latinx, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities. And for the past five of those years, the group has been contributing to Miami’s growing world of art. At its upcoming fifth annual TRANSART show and conference, there will be international performance art, artists, authors, theater and a lot of inspiration designed to enlighten everyone in our community. The event will showcase the talent, vision and possibilities within the transgender and gender nonconforming artist community 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 26, and 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 27, at the Villain Theater, 5865 NE Second Ave. in Miami’s historic Little Haiti neighborhood. Organizers include co-chairs Aryah Lester and Morgan Mayfaire; Ashley Mayfaire; programming and talent coordinator June Raven Romero; Robert Dee; and Samantha LeTroy.
“As one of the board members responsible for gathering and reviewing performance-based art applications for TRANSART, I am ensuring that the program is reflective of the best and most dynamic acts the South Florida trans community has to offer. Diversity in performance style, content and skill set as well as overall audience satisfaction quality are key factors in composing this year’s lineup,” Romero said. While the event is free, you must register in advance to attend TRANSART at www.unitycoalition.org. You can learn about the many artists in the showcase and also see the schedule. Additional events include jewelry making and inclusive language workshops, fashion and discussion, improv classes, Aryah’s Closet where you can take home free new and gently used clothing, the Chaplin Tyler Fashion Showcase and discussion, and the June Romero presentation of The Trans Experience. At the end of the two-day event, there will be a butterfly release and remembrance vigil to honor those whose lives have been lost in acts of anti-transgender violence.
22 years of etchings Be sure not to miss this exhibit of etchings at the University of Miami Otto G. Richter Library. Colombian artist and printmaker Pedro Villalba Ospina dedicated more than 22 years creating a representation — in 175 drawings and etchings — to honor “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Nobel Prize winning author Gabriel García Márquez. The works bring to life the fantastical story of love and loss in Macondo, the fictional hometown of the Buendia family. The exhibit commemorates the 50th anniversary of the book’s publication. “Etching One Hundred Years of Solitude: Gabriel García Márquez” also includes an audiovisual presentation into the artist’s process and his handwritten journal, open to the page where he estimated the entire project would be completed in one year. “An artwork can be born of many sources, but first of all it’s born of the knowledge, the intuition and the influences of your own time. Sometimes a work of art can be born of experimentation. Sometimes a work of art also inspires other works of art,” Villalba Ospina said. “Before thinking about doing the etchings, what motivated me most to read the novel so many times — besides its literary richness, its poetic beauty and its great clairvoyant and premonitory power — was my desire or my stubbornness to find a way out of salvation for that community of Macondo that existed between ingenuity, astonishment, curiosity, delirium and frustration, but that never found happiness nor the greatness or simplicity of acts of love.” He said the classic novel is also about science, inventions, music, poetry and “all the semblance of human behavior, from the highest enthusiasm to the deepest sadness, from the most sublime value to the most cowardly infamous, from the most passionate euphoria to the most quiet skepticism, from the most innocent and innocent love to the most bitter and cruel hatred, from the darkest frustration to the most enlightened hope.”
The exhibit is free and open until May 15. It is made possible in part by the support of The Tonkinson Foundation. The Richter Library is at 1300 Memorial Dr., Coral Gables. Hours vary. Call 305-284-3233 or visit www.library.miami.edu. Watch a video about the etching process at pedrovillalbaospina.com.

Teachers don sombreros, mustaches in ‘insensitive’ yearbook photos, Calif. school says 
By Don Sweeney

A California high school’s not laughing about yearbook photos showing Spanish teachers decked out in sombreros, ponchos and fake mustaches, KNSD reports. A statement released by San Pasqual High School administrators calls the photos “insensitive” and says the teachers showed “poor judgment,” KGTV reported. The Escondido school is north of San Diego. “We owe an apology to our Latinx and Chicano community, a community that I am part of,” Principal Martin Casas wrote in a statement, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. “It is unacceptable and has no place in our school. I am saddened and disappointed that this happened, but we will use it as (an) opportunity to learn and grow together.” The photos displayed in the World Language Faculty section of the school’s 2019 yearbook feature six Spanish teachers wearing sombreros and ponchos. The teachers, which include several women, also hold fake mustaches over their faces. Another instructor, a French teacher, poses in a black beret, long black gloves and sunglasses.
The school’s statement says Casas has discussed the photos with the teachers and that administrators are “taking precautions” to avoid future yearbook problems, the Escondido Times-Advocate reported. “San Pasqual High School takes pride in its rich history and diversity,” Casas says in the statement, according to the publication. “It is our intent to use this situation as a tool to remind students, as well as staff, to remember the impacts of their words and actions.”. He says the school remains committed to making everyone feel “welcome and valued,” the Escondido Times-Advocate reported. But some parents contacted by local television stations and newspapers said they weren’t bothered by the photos. “It doesn’t look offensive to me,” parent Merced Juarez said, KNSD reported. Her son had a class with one of the teachers.
“I think that lately everything is so sensitive,” said parent Tania Marin, according to the station. “If they were teaching Russian and they had a Russian hat, I would find it hilarious.” “I’m pretty sure all they wanted to do was to celebrate it, because for so long we can’t even show our Mexican culture without being degraded,” said Salma Lucero, a 16-year-old sophomore at the school, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Others weren’t sure how to feel about the photos. “They could be offensive if they’re making fun of us,” said parent Martin Pasqual, KGTV reported. “But it could be something honorable if they’re trying to do honor to the Mexican culture. It would be better without the big mustache and hats.” “As leaders in the school, that wasn’t thought through very well,” said Escondido resident Brooke Angaga, KNSD reported. “I thought it was racist,” said C.J. Craig, a 15-year-old freshman at the school, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. “I thought they were making fun.”"

Wynwood is hosting its first pride festival. Here’s everything you need to know
By Amanda Rosa

Wigs, glitter, rainbows and activism are upon us. The first Wynwood Pride is coming. While South Florida queer strongholds Miami Beach and Wilton Manors have held pride events in April and June, respectively, for decades, Wynwood is finally hosting a pride festival of its own. The Wynwood Business Improvement District and events group SWARM Events announced the pride celebration, set to take place at Wynwood Marketplace, last month. The full line-up of musicians and drag artists that will perform during the weekend has been released. The acts include Brazilian drag singer Pabllo Vittar, “Rupaul’s Drag Race” star AJA, Cuban lesbian salsa icon Albita and Miss Toto, the formerly Miami-based drag queen known for her muscles and Big Mouth-inspired lip sync performances. Anna Albelo, the Wynwood Pride executive director and co-founder, said the festival, which is lovingly nicknamed “Queerchella,” is focused on promoting LGBTQ talent and local community service organizations in the same location. Wynwood’s origins in street art and expression makes it the perfect backdrop for a pride celebration that combines community and art, Albelo said.
“There’s still a lot of space in Wynwood to create,” she said. Miami hasn’t had a pride celebration in June (which is LGBTQ Pride Month) since 1996 because it’s too hot and the chance of rain is too high, Albelo said. (The festival will be held under a tent so the event goes on rain or shine.) She said holding the festival in June is politically significant and puts Miami on the world’s radar for pride celebrations. “[Pride is] such a vital necessity,” Albelo said. “Once a year, you’re going to be able to see and meet and discover thousands of people and the message, ‘You are not alone.’” What’s poppin’ at the festival? Festival-goers can RSVP online to get a free drink while supplies last. The website also offers a three-day “VIP Front Row” for access to the best view of performances, a private bar and air-conditioned restrooms for $95 (before tax.)
The Wynwood Pride app is available for iPhone and Android and will include the festival’s full schedule. The festival will feature: live concerts drag performances A “Family Zone” with Drag Queen Story hour, face-painting and games A vogue dance competition Drag brunch Film showcases Art and fashion installations Panel discussions on LGBTQ issues Who’s going to be there? The line-up of local, national and international singers, rappers and drag artists includes: Pabllo Vittar Ivy Queen Poppy AJA Dorian Electra Albita Carmen Carrera Miss Toto Tama Gucci Queef Latina
Is it all fun and games? For many, Pride Month is a chance to party. For others, it’s a time to protest. Albelo said the Wynwood festival was organized with entertainment, political activism and community service in mind. “Miami’s really, really on the map for a new generation of 21st-century activism,” she said. Each year, the festival will promote three themes that are relevant to the LGBTQ community and partner with nonprofit organizations that will be beneficiaries of the proceeds, Albelo said. This year, the festival is highlighting organizations that work with the themes of youth, health and justice. The beneficiaries are Pridelines, a South Florida LGBTQ youth service group; the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, a queer activist and advocacy foundation; and Survivor’s Pathways, an advocacy organization for domestic and sexual violence survivors with the nation’s largest program servicing Latinx transgender women. The festival is offering 20 local nonprofits free space to set up at a “Community Village” to provide services like HIV testing, counseling information and opportunities for wardrobe and monetary donations. What if I get hungry? The festival will host local food trucks and vendors. A full list of the food trucks will be available closer to the festival date, but for now, Milly’s Empanada Factory is confirmed to be there."

John Leguizamo is ready to school you on America’s Latino heroes 
By CHRISTINE DOLEN 

John Leguizamo is a man whose talents are eclectic and seemingly limitless. The Colombia-born, Queens-raised artist is an actor, director, playwright, comedian, author and master of the solo show. Observant, thought-provoking and often hilarious, those one-man shows began with the Obie Award-winning “Mambo Mouth” in 1991. Leguizamo followed up with “Spic-O-Rama” (1993), “Freak” (1998), “Sexaholix … A Love Story” (2002), “Ghetto Klown” (2011) and “Latin History for Morons” (2017). That last show, which he’ll perform July 12-14 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, was nominated for the 2018 best play Tony Award, and Leguizamo was honored with a special Tony for three decades of bringing diverse stories and audiences to Broadway. Director and star of the upcoming film “Critical Thinking,” which chronicles the 1998 triumph of Miami Jackson Senior High School’s chess team in becoming the first urban team to win the U.S. National Chess Championship, Leguizamo, 54, has had an extensive and stylistically diverse movie career, including roles in “Super Mario Brothers,” “Carlito’s Way,” “Romeo + Juliet,” “Spawn,” “Summer of Sam,” “Moulin Rouge,” “Collateral Damage,” “Ice Age,” “Chef,” “The Crash” and many more films. His solo shows were filmed by HBO and, in the case of “Latin History for Morons,” Netflix. Yet for all that success, Leguizamo knows only too well the ongoing challenges of forging a mainstream show-biz career as a Latino artist. “Latin History for Morons” grew out of his attempts to help his son Lucas, now a college student, on a middle-school project about heroes after the younger Leguizamo was repeatedly bullied and called a “beaner.” Over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Leguizamo called to talk about his show, his life and his well-researched belief that a multitude of Latino heroes played a huge role in shaping this country.
I know that your attempts to help your son when he was being bullied in middle school inspired “Latin History for Morons.” How did you go about doing your research on the ways Latinos contributed to this country’s history? I started first to try to weaponize this information, to get facts; to say this Latin hero did this, this one did that. I started with our empires, started giving him everything we contributed to the whole world: chocolate, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, anesthesia, brain surgery, barbecue. The Incas had a binary code that predated computers. They had socialism that worked for the whole empire. Then, I lucked into these other books. I talked to some Latin history professors, and they told me, “Read Howard Zinn’s ‘A People’s History of the United States.’ ” You read that, look at his research, you find more research. And you discover all these amazing things about Latin people. We’re the oldest ethnic group in America, after Native Americans. We fought in every single war. We’re the most decorated minority in every war. Ten thousand unknown Latin patriots fought in the American Revolution out of 80,000 troops. I found that out, then I wanted to know how many soldiers fought in the American Revolution, because I wanted to know what percentage that was. So that’s how I did my research. One thing led to another and another. They said that only 30,000 [Latinos] fought in World War I, but 20,000 fought in the Civil War and 500,000 in World War II. So that, to me, was wrong. I did more research and found out if you were a light-skinned Hispanic in World War I, they didn’t classify you differently from the white soldiers. It was different if you were dark-skinned or spoke Spanish.
I took you too deep into the rabbit hole, but I did deductive reasoning to try to get there. Do you feel sometimes when you’re working on pieces that it’s like doing a grad-school course for yourself? Yeah, this definitely was a master’s, and if I’d gone a little further, it would be a Ph.D. How long did it take you to develop this show, and how did you go about balancing the mixture of facts, entertainment and very understandable outrage? It was a trial-and-error process. … My shows take four to five years to workshop. I started out really gung ho about the history and thought, “People are gonna love it.” I had the Vietnam War, the War of 1812 that nobody even cares about. I had Simón Bolívar. I had so many historic figures and sketches and funny stuff. But people were not groovin’ with me. I was like, “What? C’mon, man.” I had to find the balance. So I started reducing the history. Then, I reduced it too much. I didn’t like the show so much. It seemed like the right recipe was historic anecdote, then an analogous personal story of mine. That’s the way people enjoyed the history, and I was able to make it palatable to them. My real demographic is young Latinx, so how do I turn them and make them desperate for that information? Why do you think it is that so much of Latino history in the United States is missing from textbooks? I think the obvious reason is a power grab. Because if you’ve had people fighting alongside you … if you put these people in textbooks, you have to celebrate them and give them power. So if you exclude them, you can always take away their land, take away their power. It’s much easier to do it to people you have excluded from the creation of your country. Why do you think so many states have Spanish names? Florida, California, Colorado, Arizona. Those are all Spanish words. Gen. Bernardo de Gálvez in the American Revolutionary War gave … weapons [and ammunition to aid] George Washington, plus 3,000 soldiers who were Puerto_Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Native American and slaves. And they kicked the British out of Texas, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle. Without that effort, America [might] still be a British colony. So how can you not give credit to that? What is the purpose of excluding that contribution?
One of the things you mention in the show is the daily microaggressions faced by Latino people in the United States. Can you talk about that, then talk about this macroaggression that is President Trump’s immigration policy toward Mexico and Central America? And Puerto_Rico. And the harsh sanctions on Cuba. It’s toward every Latin person. As a Latin person, you deal with a lot of microaggressions daily. Just me going to pitch stuff to studio heads. I get things like with “Critical Thinking,” this movie I just directed about Latin kids who became 1998 chess champions from Overtown. I would pitch it, and they’d say, “Oh, Latin people don’t want to see feel-good movies.” Does that mean we only want to see depressing movies? I really doubt that. Other times, I’ve been told by studio heads that Latin people don’t want to see Latin people. There’s all this crazy Hollywood “wisdom” that is really microaggressions that I gotta deal with on a daily basis. You go, “Why is there no Latin content?” Well, they’re killing it at the root, at the creation of it. That’s just me in the business. And someone like you, with such a long and deep record of achievement, if that’s happening to you, what’s happening to people trying to break into the business? That’s what I mean. If I’m having to deal with this BS, that’s why I do everything, because I’m not gonna be stopped. It’s like Tyler Perry said, “I’m not waiting to be invited to a table that I’m not going to be invited to. I’m going to make my own table.” That’s why I do theater. That’s why I do comedy clubs, I do movies, I do TV, I do it all. I write, I produce, I direct. Because as a Latino person, as an immigrant, you have to be five times better than the regular white person to succeed. You made your TV acting debut on “Miami Vice” when you were 19. I know you directed and starred in “Critical Thinking” here. How often have you worked in the Miami area, and what do you feel about the city’s diverse majority Latino population?
Oh, my God, I love going to Miami. I just feel so at home. There’s a sense of pride when you go to every establishment and the owners are Latin, and the people running the place are Latin, and people in power are Latin. It’s such a different experience than going to Los Angeles, where you feel like you’re in an apartheid state. Where all the Latin people are just serving everybody else and they’re living in a ghetto situation, and they’re allowed in the gated communities only as servants. But when I go to Miami, it’s like, “Yes. That’s the world as I believe it can be.” Our population is so diverse: Cuban, Colombian, Argentine, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, Peruvian, Brazilian and more. Do you feel like the Arsht Center audience is going to get this on a deeper level than the average audience? Oh, absolutely. It’s like being home. What I’ve found is that the level of emotions I felt during the research and during the experience of the bullying, it’s amazing how Latin people feel all those emotions that I felt. You feel so proud of everything we’ve accomplished. You feel shocked that this information was kept from you. Then, you feel outraged that it’s not in textbooks. You’re depressed by the end of these beautiful empires. You begin to understand the uphill battle that Latin people have had. … .So you leave the show feeling the way I felt. It’s wild. I didn’t know how to process all those emotions. The only thing I hope they walk away with is that information can be weaponized. That’s hopefully the gift that I can give back. Do you feel like working on this show transformed the way you’re going to do future shows? Actually, it did. First of all, the show is so empowering to me. Especially when I hear 13-year-old kids going, “Why was this kept from me, man?” I want to do these informative shows, shows that elevate not only comically but also elevate us historically and intellectually. That’s really exciting to me. There is an immigrant-detention camp here in Homestead. Do you hope your show will also help spur people to figure out more powerful ways to demand the end of holding families and children in camps?
It’s horrifying to see people who were just like the Pilgrims, coming across the ocean for a better life for their kids and risking their lives for that. Then, when people of color start coming, they’re being held captive, put in cages, children separated from their parents. Kept without proper food and bedding. It’s so cruel and inhuman. It’s hard to believe that that’s our country, and that religious groups are OK with that. What happened to Christianity? It’s odd that they go, “We love our brothers and sisters, but only if they’re a certain way.” I don’t understand how they compartmentalize that."

DeSantis’ office had two Pulse drafts. He signed the one that omitted LGBTQ, Hispanic.
By Steve Contorno

The Florida governor’s office created two versions of a June proclamation marking the three-year remembrance of the Pulse night club shooting, according to documents obtained this week by the Tampa Bay Times. One proclamation acknowledged the tragedy’s LGBTQ and Hispanic victims. The other did not. Gov. Ron DeSantis ultimately signed the one that did not. DeSantis later said that was a mistake and he issued a corrected proclamation recognizing the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities. His office blamed staff error. But the previously unreported documents indicate that someone inside the governor’s office had created two drastically different options for DeSantis to send out. The one draft version declared: “The State of Florida will not tolerate hatred towards the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities and we will stand boldly with Orlando and the Central Florida community against terrorism and hate.” That one initially did not make it out of the governor’s office. Instead, DeSantis signed one that omitted the reference to the victims’ sexuality and ethnicity. It also removed the word “hate.”
That proclamation stated: “The entire state of Florida has come together to stand boldly with Orlando and the Central Florida community against terrorism.” The records don’t make clear why two versions were written or who authored them, nor do they indicate DeSantis knew an alternative draft existed. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré blamed confusion, saying “the process was circumvented by a staff member” who shouldn’t have been involved. A month before the proclamation was issued, emails showed uncertainty between the governor’s advance team and his legal staff over who would oversee the remembrance. Proclamations by the governor commemorate days of remembrance and sometimes ask that flags be flown at half-staff. “Normally, the communications department works with citizen services to prepare proclamations, correspondence and statements on behalf of the governor,” Ferré said, referring to two separate arms in the governor’s office that issue public statements. “This did not occur in the case of the Pulse proclamation.” After the story published Friday morning, Ferré added that the governor’s office was unaware a second draft proclamation existed.
“Regrettably, the only proclamation that was presented for 2019 did not include the important references to the LGBTQ and Hispanic victims of this tragic attack,” she said. On Twitter, Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, suggested that the mistake in the governor’s office occurred because of “a disregard for #LGBTQ people and #latinx communities. Likely because these aren’t constituencies that our governor thinks about often.” Eskamani encouraged DeSantis to support legislation that guarantees protections for LGBTQ people in the workplace. The bill gained more traction this past year than ever before but still failed to pass. Under Republican dominance in Tallahassee, LGBTQ communities have been frustrated by lack of progress on equality and recognition in the country’s third most populous state. Even after a gunman killed 49 people on June 12, 2016, inside Pulse and the state rallied around the Orlando community, survivors have said they are overlooked because of the sexual orientation and ethnicity of victims. Pulse was a gay night club and occurred on the bar’s Latin night. A majority of the victims were LGBTQ and Hispanic. It took three years for lawmakers to approve money for a Pulse memorial. The Legislature set aside $1 million for a Parkland memorial just weeks after a gunman killed 17 people last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Former Gov. Rick Scott did not wear a Pulse ribbon for two years, and advocates say he shirked a promise to sign an LGBTQ protection order after promising he would. DeSantis’ first executive order was an anti-discrimination pledge for state workers that omitted protections based on sexual orientation. After receiving pushback, his office met with Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, an openly gay lawmaker from Orlando, who said they were working together “in good faith.” “This all continues to be very disappointing and demonstrates no new leadership on LGBTQ equality,” Eskamani tweeted.
The drafts of the proclamation were obtained by the Times in a records request with the DeSantis’ office. The records provided also included previously undisclosed draft versions of Scott’s Pulse remembrances. In 2017 and 2018, Scott’s office also created versions that did not mention the LGBTQ community, the records show. The one Scott signed in 2018 ultimately acknowledged “the lasting impact [the shooting] has had on our state and communities, including Florida’s LGBTQ community.” The backlash was immediate when DeSantis issued a proclamation on the eve of the June 12 remembrance without that acknowledgment. Pulse victims and LGBTQ advocates criticized DeSantis for the omission. Embarrassing national headlines for the young Republican governor circulated online. By midday, DeSantis had issued a corrected proclamation that included a reference to the affected communities. He visited the Pulse memorial in Orlando later that day. “Once Gov. DeSantis learned of this staff error, he immediately ordered a corrected version of the proclamation be re-issued to include the reference to the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities,” Ferré said, “which had been included in his statement on Twitter earlier that morning.”"

Latinx voters will bring their American values to the polls in 2020
By Mari Corugedo

The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) proudly is celebrating 90 years of service to Hispanic communities across the United States. As the oldest and most respected Hispanic civil-rights organization protecting the rights of communities of color and of the Latinx community, we understand the power of our vote in all elections, but particularly the 2020 races. Our community must understand that our time is now. Democracy does not die when we all exercise our duty to vote — and vote for candidates who support issues that matter to all Americans. Our democracy, while messy at times, works only if everyone participates. Issues matter, and holding candidates accountable for where they stand on key issues is critical, as is holding their feet to the fire after they are elected. Immigration reform is a top priority, of course. We want an end to the separation of children and families and the immediate closing of border camps. Then lawmakers should get to work on comprehensive immigration reform to address the border crisis, DACA recipients living in limbo and a broad and deep fix of our broken immigration system. But Hispanics are looking for far more action from elected officials. Key issues include:
Ensuring everyone is counted in the next Census and protecting voting rights for the 2020 elections and beyond. Action on climate change, which disproportionately affects minorities and low-income communities across the nation. - Ensuring equity through education by addressing college affordability, along with the current student-debt crisis, which is unsustainable. Equity includes addressing the lack of native-language assessments for non-English-speaking students and increasing investment in early learning, ending the current privatization and defunding of our public education system and focusing on solutions to end systemic disparities affecting communities of color. These are many of our communities’ priorities for 2020. Our communities’ value hard work, our responsibilities to ourselves and others, our families and our country. We understand the importance of leveling the playing fields so others can achieve the American Dream. We understand that our strength is found in our diversity and in our unity without forgetting to pave the way for others as it was done for us. We honor and value American values of life, liberty, justice and the pursuit of happiness. Latinx communities will not stand idle as those seeking office are complicit in our communities being stigmatized and painted with a broad brush to help advance a false representation of who we are. We are as American as anyone else and will not tolerate hateful messages of “go back.” We are Americans, and we love and uplift our country every day. We may disagree on policy, but that does not take away from who we are as Americans.
We must always respect and uphold our values as Americans no matter our ethnicity, religion, politics, whom we love, gender or wealth. We must not allow anyone to use patriotism to advance hate and division and we must demand truth and leadership from those elected to office. America has always been a beacon of hope for justice, liberty, and opportunity for all and we are a nation of immigrants where our diversity is our strength. The Latinx community will not stray from what unites us as Americans, and we will defend this nation’s democracy, constitutional rights, and pursuit of justice for all of us. Our power is our vote, and we will exercise it and get others to do so too. Next year will be a pivotal time in our history. Latinx communities will make sure our voices are heard through our vote. Those seeking our support must not be silent during these bizarre times. Instead, they must take action against weaponized hate against our communities. We will defend and protect our values and dreams as the Americans that we all are. An injustice to one community is an injustice to all communities; therefore, we will not wait for change — we will be the change we seek through organizing, mobilizing — and voting. Mari Corugedo is LULAC’s Florida state director."

UM’s medical school is whiter than Miami. A group of students wants to change that
By Ben Conarck

Miami is brimming with diversity, but the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine doesn’t adequately reflect that in the percentage of black and Hispanic students and professors, according to a new report by a group of medical students focused on racial justice. The group, White Coats 4 Black Lives, released its second annual report on racial equality in medical schools last week, judging 17 medical schools on 14 different metrics. The report graded the UM medical school as a “C+,” a middle-of-the-pack ranking. The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine pushed back against the report, saying that diversity and inclusion are “part of the core values of the University of Miami, values that are championed by leadership and disseminated to all.” “At every touchpoint of our mission, we strive for racial equality and an atmosphere that is inclusive of the many different people who make up our community,” the school said in a statement. Seven medical students from UM, who are members of White Coats 4 Black Lives, collaborated with about a dozen additional faculty and students who were affiliated with the local chapter of Campaign Against Racism for the report.
The Campaign Against Racism was founded by Camara Jones, past president of the American Public Health Association, and is a subset of the Social Medicine Consortium, a group of healthcare providers aiming to dismantle structural racism. One of the top concerns for the groups involved in the report was the racial makeup of the school’s faculty, based on data collected from the school’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion, as well as the demographics of the student body. About 3% of medical school faculty is black, compared to about 16% of Miami-Dade County’s population. And the student body has 60 black students, or 7% of the 2018-2019 class, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. The report also looked at Latinx people — a gender-neutral term for Latina or Latino — and found that they make up about 69% of Miami-Dade County’s population, but account for only 10.6% of the student body and 27% of the school’s faculty, according to data from the school’s diversity office and the AAMC. Chris Garcia-Wilde, a second-year medical student who helped organize the study at UM, said it’s important that the medical student body reflects the demographics of Miami because “we’re the ones on the front lines engaging the community.”
“In the hospitals and in the health fairs and in the clinics, we need medical students who can understand and who can build trust with patients to ensure better health outcomes,” Garcia-Wilde said. Going back decades, studies have shown that minority patients are more likely to pursue certain medical procedures if they are recommended by healthcare providers who share their cultural and racial backgrounds. Last year, the National Bureau of Economic Research built upon that body of research, releasing a study based on 1,300 black men in California’s Bay Area that found the men were more likely to agree to invasive procedures and preventative screenings if they saw black doctors, attributing that outcome to better communication. Garcia-Wilde said that structural racism has permeated areas of education, health and wealth, and has a cumulative effect that manifests in skewed health outcomes for marginalized communities. That, he said, is why it’s crucial to get more underrepresented minorities into medical schools and working as healthcare providers. “The lack of representation leads to poor health outcomes,” Garcia-Wilde said. “It’s serious that racism kills.” White Coats For Black Lives’ Racial Justice Report Card graded medical schools on metrics ranging from recruitment, anti-racism training, grade disparities, and policies about safeguarding undocumented patients from immigration officials. UM’s Miller School of Medicine was the only Florida medical school graded. The Miller School of Medicine received high marks for its system of collecting student and faculty reports of racism and oppression, but didn’t rate as well in other metrics such as making public data on how minority students are performing or how many are enrolled in honors programs. The medical school did not respond to the specific criticisms levied by the report, saying instead that “it is impossible and inaccurate to represent an institution’s comprehensive and evolving efforts to achieve racial justice into a simple letter grade.”
A Miller school spokesperson also emphasized that the school won an award last year for its efforts on diversity and inclusion. The school also last year named Henri Ford, a Haitian immigrant, as dean of the medical school. Medical schools have been grappling with diversity problems for at least a decade. In 2009, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, an accrediting body for medical schools, established new guidelines on diversity in an attempt to improve representation for minority groups. A newly released cross-sectional study of medical school students from 2002 to 2017 by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that black, Latinx, and American Indian or Alaska Native people remain underrepresented in medical schools compared with the U.S. population, despite the new accreditation guidelines. The study, “Trends in Racial/Ethnic Representation Among US Medical Students,” suggested “a need for both the development and the evaluation of more robust policies and programs to create a physician workforce that is demographically representative of the U.S. population.”"

Biden says Trump administration has ‘abandoned our leadership in the hemisphere’ 
By David Smiley

In his first public campaign event in Miami since announcing his candidacy for president in April, former Vice President Joe Biden blasted President Donald Trump on Sunday in Little Havana for having “abandoned our leadership in the hemisphere.” Biden, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, stopped at Ball & Chain on Southwest Eighth Street for an outdoor event his campaign billed as a meet-and-greet with Miami’s “Latinx” community. Wearing aviator glasses and a white dress shirt with the sleeves slightly rolled-up, he told a standing-room only crowd that Trump has left Latin America to literally burn. “While the Amazon is burning, we’re talking about $20 million to organize, to help [Brazil President Jair] Bolsonaro do something?” BIden said incredulously, referring to the financial aid offered last month to Brazil by the world leaders during the G-7 summit. “Were I president, we’d make it real clear. Mr. President, here’s the deal: It’s in your area but you’re causing damage to the whole world. We’ll pay all you’ll need to do worldwide to take on the responsibility of ending those fires and not taking down the rain forests. And if you don’t, here are the consequences.” Biden also ripped Trump over his refusal to grant Venezuelans temporary protected status, and defended his comments during Thursday’s Democratic debate in Houston that he “confronted” embattled Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. “I do know Maduro. I did have a coming to the Lord meeting with Maduro. No matter that the press said I didn’t: Not true,” Biden said, speaking about a conversation he had with Maduro in January 2015 during then-Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s swearing-in ceremony. “I told [Maduro], we’d talk with him if he did the following things, starting with setting up elections, making sure he’d release political prisoners, a whole range of things. That kind of ended our conversation.”
By riffing on Latin America, Biden was entering territory that Trump has mostly owned in recent months, at least on the presidential campaign trail. Presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have met with Venezuelan exiles in Miami this year. But as the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have focused on early primary states and U.S. policy, Florida Democrats have feared that Trump has been mostly left unchecked to court Miami’s exile communities. Trump’s administration backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in January when he declared himself Venezuela’s rightfully elected president, and he declared the “twilight of socialism” under his administration during a speech in Miami early this year. Trump has also repeatedly cast Democrats as socialists as the party debates whether to socialize medicine and increase taxes on the wealthy. The Trump campaign attacked Biden after Thursday’s debate, tweeting out a picture of him smiling while speaking with Maduro in Brazil. On Sunday, Trump Victory spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez reacted to Biden’s appearance in Miami by saying that “voters are concerned as he hugs a socialist agenda in an attempt to compete in the Democratic primary.” But Biden spent much of the day undercutting Trump’s message to Hispanic voters in Miami, and his event lured at least two voters who told the Miami Herald they were registered without party affiliation and considering registering as a Democrat to vote for Biden.
Later in the day, during a fundraiser in the Design District, Biden also framed his candidacy as a “rational” and less-radical approach to defeating Trump than his top competitors, U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “I truly believe we can fundamentally change our standard for middle-class people in America without going out and making sure no one can be a billionaire” he said during an appearance at the Moore Building, 191 NE 40th Street. “We don’t need that kind of stuff. The fact of the matter is just a rational policy” will suffice. Ana Navarro, a Republican analyst for CNN and biting Trump critic, attended Biden’s event in Little Havana and said afterward that she was impressed not only with his speech but also his ability to withstand a sweltering Miami summer afternoon. Biden’s stamina and mental acumen were questioned after his performance during Thursday’s debate. But after finishing his speech by rousing the audience to action, Biden took a photo with a half-dozen children he’d pulled up onto a pineapple-shaped stage and then hurried over to an older woman who’d fainted in the heat. “I saw a guy stand up there in 95-degree weather, with the sun beating down and 95 percent humidity, who has the energy and the vision and the optimism and the ability to inspire,” said Navarro. “I had not seen him in action during this campaign and I thought he was impressive. I’m so glad he touched upon the Venezuela issue.” As Navarro spoke to the Miami Herald, Biden milled about, speaking to people who lined up to take pictures with him. He filmed a quick video with Ramón Muchacho, the exiled former mayor of the Chacao District in Caracas. “Stay strong. We’re with you. The world is with you. Things are going to get better,” Biden said as Muchacho recorded a video on his phone that he blasted out to his 1.5 million Twitter followers.
Biden has a massive lead nationally among black voters. But he is competing with the field for the Hispanic vote, with a CNN poll finalized Sept. 9 showing Sanders ahead of Biden among Hispanic voters, albeit well within a wide margin of error. Biden continues to hold a cushion over the field nationally. And while there have been few polls in Florida, where the presidential primary falls after Super Tuesday, Biden held a massive lead over Sanders and Warren in the state during the early summer before the first of three debates. Biden’s visit to Miami followed a stop at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Alabama, where four back girls were killed in a Sept. 15 basement bombing 56 years ago. From Miami, he was headed to South Carolina."

Uncle Luke blasts Jay Z and NFL over Super Bowl performers 
By C. Isaiah Smalls II

Not everyone was excited about Jennifer Lopez and Shakira being named Super Bowl 54 halftime show performers. Luther Campbell — a.k.a. Uncle Luke — blasted Jay Z and the NFL for not picking a Miami artist to headline the championship game, calling the decision “ass-backward” in a recent column. “Pitbull, AKA Mr. Worldwide, along with Flo Rida and Rick Ross should really be the headliners of this halftime show,” Campbell wrote in the Miami New Times. “J. Lo and Shakira should be Pitbull’s invited guests since he did songs with them. And Flo Rida should be inviting Trick Daddy, Trina and other Miami superstars to share the spotlight.” Campbell also took issue with how his city was being characterized by the media. “On the NFL Network, league officials said the show is going to promote Latinx culture because Miami is all about Hispanic people,” Campbell continued. “That’s a slap in the face to the African-American community, which includes a diverse mix of Bahamian, Jamaican, and Haitian people.”
The 2 Live Crew rapper goes on to say that Jay Z, whose company Roc Nation partnered with the NFL as an entertainment consultant in early August, violated the “G code” by not having a conversation with him prior to making this decision. “When you go into another man’s city, you are supposed to consult with him,” Campbell wrote. Campbell’s column doubled down on an Instagram video he posted Friday after the performers were announced. In the video, Campbell demands Jay Z “fix this sh*t.”
While some showed support, many Twitter and Instagram users weren’t a fan of Uncle Luke’s comments. On Twitter, one person wrote, “So having Latinas perform in a heavily Latino city is a bad thing how” while a more comical Instagram user commented “Trick Daddy really? You wanna see Khaled yelling out ‘we the best’ and ‘another one’ for 10 minute” on Campbell’s video. Campbell is just the latest musician to take issue with the NFL’s recently named halftime performers. On Friday, Twisted Sister’s Dee Snider tweeted that rock bands deserve more consideration for Super Bowls."

What’s it like for this Miami native to play the head of a cartel on TV? He’ll tell you
By JOSE SEPULVEDA

“When the humidity hits and the mosquitoes bite, I feel like I’m back home.” Those were the first things Danny Pino noticed when returning home to South Florida. Pino is a Miami native now starring as Miguel Galindo in the hit FX show “Mayans M.C.,” a spin-off of “Sons of Anarchy.” Pino is known for his previous turns playing law-abiding good guys on two hit series, “Cold Case” on CBS (2003-10) and NBC’s “Law and Order: SVU” (2011-15). In “Mayans M.C.,” Pino’s Galindo is an Ivy League-educated businessman who tries to legitimize the family business after taking over as the head of the Galindo cartel. Pino spoke about the show’s second season, Pino’s work in preparing for his character and diversity, and intersectionality in the entertainment industry.
The violence on the U.S.-Mexico border is portrayed in the show “is unique because it challenges the actor to find the duality of the characters and try to find the humanity,” Pino said. “That’s not to say to glorify them or to revere them, but to try and understand that.” He sees his Miguel Galindo as a transitional character, trying to bridge the gap between the violence and business worlds by “taking the reins of the cartel in a very academic way.” He added that “even if you don’t like the character, you still recognize his humanity. …We all have a little Miguel Galindo in us.” That duality is something he attributes to the good writing of the show which features a majority Latinx cast. “You can’t have the diversity first,” Pino says. “I think the diversity needs to be there, but it needs to be in use at a very high level. So we need to demand that our stories are complex and complicated and interesting.” “Mayans M.C.” is in its second season and also features JD Pardo and Edward James Olmos.
According to FX, “Mayans M.C.” is “set in a post-Jax Teller world, Ezekiel “EZ” Reyes (JD Pardo) is a prospect in the Mayans M.C. charter on the Cali/Mexi border. Once the golden boy with the American Dream in his grasp, EZ is trying to reconcile with his brother “Angel” (Clayton Cardenas) while searching for the truth behind their mother’s death. Meanwhile, their father “Felipe” (Edward James Olmos) is struggling to lead his sons down a righteous path. “The series also stars Sarah Bolger, Michael Irby, Carla Baratta, Antonio Jaramillo, Raoul Max Trujillo, Richard Cabral, Danny Pino and Emilio Rivera. “Mayans M.C.” was co-created by Kurt Sutter and Elgin James. The series is executive produced by Sutter, James and Kevin Dowling. The 10-episode second season is produced by Fox 21 Television Studios and FX Productions. “Mayans M.C.” is on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on FX."

Whatever the label, Hispanic, Latino, or Latinx, fight racism by registering to vote
By Fabiola Santiago

Cash-strapped but hopeful, a lineup of Latino community advocates has launched an ambitious nationwide voter registration drive with the unifying “stand up and vote” theme. One of the top targets is Florida. The goal of “Poder 2020” is to change through a technology-driven, social network campaign this astonishing statistic: Between 15 million and 18 million Latinos in this country are U.S. citizens eligible to vote, but they aren’t registered to do so. And, looking into the future, there’s this other fact : Every 30 seconds, a Latino in the United States is turning 18, voting age. “No matter Republican, Democrat, or independent, the more voters, the more poder [power],” said Ben Monterroso, senior advisor to Poder Latinx.
The group’s mission is “to build a political wave where the Latinx community plays a key role in the transformation of our country, where immigrants, Latinx and other people of color are decision-makers of our political process.” They’re the latest group to step up to the plate looking forward to the 2020 election.
If all the Latinos eligible were registered — and voted to end the demonizing of immigrants, the insults and attacks, and the xenophobic immigration policy coming from the White House — Donald J. Trump might just be a one-term president. But to make this happen, advocates need voter registration and turnout success in swing-state Florida, which Trump won after the so-called “Obama coalition” of black, Hispanic, and other minority voters didn’t turn out to vote with the same enthusiasm as in 2008 and 2012.
One of the most talked about voter groups is Central Florida’s Puerto_Ricans, automatic U.S. citizens who were supposed to be Hillary Clinton’s “secret weapon” but didn’t show up in large enough numbers. The thousands forced to relocate to the Orlando area by Hurricane Maria’s devastation are a new pool of potential voters. But will they be angry enough at Trump’s shortchanging them of aid and his contemptuous attitude — and motivated enough to vote? Other important groups are Cuban Americans and Venezuelans in South Florida, not exactly monolithic in party alliances but still stirred by the politics of Cuba and Latin America. No, it won’t be easy making inroads with Latino/Latinx/Hispanic citizens in Florida. Latino, Latinx or Hispanic? If you’ve read this far, you can already see part of the problem with outreach and messaging, right? We can’t even agree on what to call ourselves — and every label comes with connotation and baggage. For some, Hispanics is a lazy U.S. government-imposed term to cast everyone from a Spanish-speaking country under an umbrella. The more widely accepted Latinos has gone all of a sudden out of fashion. But being replaced by Latinx is only creating confusion. For some, the contemporary Latinx has shifted from being an inclusive gender-neutral term to acquiring overtones of a left-wing agenda. How do we overcome labels in favor of a straight and simple message that appeals to progressives and conservatives in communities? Latinx, Latinos, Hispanics, it shouldn’t really matter what people call us — or what we call ourselves. Let academics, philosophers, and pundits battle out the semantics. What does matter is whether the country’s second-largest minority group can be effectively reached and galvanized to become the voting force for better governance. There has always been racism and xenophobia in Florida. But, before Trump, the prevailing narrative was that the state’s growing Hispanic population was a welcomed and vital part of the state’s economy and cultural heritage. These days, many Hispanics who live outside of Miami-Dade County live in fear of becoming targets of racist violence in a state that has been adopting Trump-inspired anti-immigrant legislation. Fight racism by voting In Sarasota last weekend, for example, five young Puerto_Rican tennis players competing in an international tournament were removed from the Bath & Racquet Club after a candidate for the city commission, Martin Hyde, accosted the players for speaking Spanish and had them removed from the premises.
He’s seen on video telling them to “go cut the grass” and “shut up.” “That’s racism, man,” one of the players, a 15-year-old, says to Hyde.. “How can you say something like that? Aren’t you human?” “This is a private club,” Hyde responds. “Get out.” Menor boricua jugador de tenis fue expulsado de las facilidades de Celsius Tennis Academy por hablar español.

The lack of respect isn’t surprising, given that the sponsor of anti-immigrant legislation was state Republican Party Chairman Sen. Joe Gruters of Sarasota. Yes, if ever there was a time, it’s now. Florida’s non-registered citizens need to wake up and demand respect by voting. There’s only one label that can make a difference. “Somos americanos.” We’re Americans, too. But it means little if we don’t embrace to our full potential the responsibility to vote."

Miami New Drama’s ‘The Cubans’ is all about family 
By CHRISTINE DOLEN

Michael Leon is a successful New York-based actor who grew up in Miami. Since graduating from Florida International University and Manhattan’s Atlantic Acting School, he has worked with high-profile companies including the LAByrinth Theater Co., New York Theatre Workshop, Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, Steppenwolf Theatre, Northlight Theatre, INTAR Theatre and more. Leon also has been an admirer of complex family plays, but he’s felt that diverse voices are too often missing. “I got tired of going to the theater and not seeing myself and my family represented. We deserve more. I felt compelled to start creating something, not for me but for my community,” he says. This week, after four years of writing and readings and rewrites, Leon’s creative response to what he felt was missing will get its world premiere when Miami New Drama opens “The Cubans” at the Colony Theatre on Miami Beach’s Lincoln Road. Company co-founder and artistic director Michel Hausmann credits Erik J. Rodriguez, Miami New Drama’s director of new work, with championing Leon’s play.
“Erik insisted I should consider it further and organized a reading,” Hausmann says. “I love that Michael is exploring his generation, his community. It’s his Miami play. There is a lot to explore in the Cuban-American experience … lo bonito, lo feo (the pretty, the ugly) … and he’s writing with a critical eye. I’m producing ‘The Cubans’ because I also want to produce Michael’s second play, his third play.” Hausmann thinks director Victoria Collado – fresh from her staging of Miami’s much-extended immersive theater hit, “The Amparo Experience” – has been a great creative partner for Leon, given her success at juggling multiple simultaneous storylines. “Sometimes, this play has seven conversations going at the same time. That is so true to a lot of Hispanic families. It’s as if great musicians are playing at the same time,” he says. Leon began writing “The Cubans” in 2016. Then 30, he had gone through an identity crisis after leaving South Florida and moving to Chicago, then New York. “I grew up in a place with a Cuban-American majority, then went to Chicago and suddenly felt like a minority,” he says. “When I went out for roles, they’d look at me to play gangsters. Yet in New York, there’s an incredible group of Latinx writers. We should be further along by now.”
Over cafecito Cubano and tostones, Leon, Collado and others read through “The Cubans” on the day after Thanksgiving 2016 in Collado’s New York apartment. At that gathering, Leon asked Collado, also an FIU grad, to direct his debut play. Four years into the script’s evolution, Collado says, “The audience should expect to see a very heightened version of themselves. It’s not a form of criticism or stereotyping. It’s an opportunity for the Cuban people of Miami to see themselves onstage – with a little extra.” “The Cubans” centers on a pair of family gatherings in the middle-class Westchester home of Martica (Vivian Ruiz) and husband Jesus (James Puig). Their struggling actor-daughter Christy (Ashley Alvarez) has come from New York for a summer get-together celebrating her younger brother Mati’s graduation from the University of Florida. Also part of the party are nephew Ramoncito (Andhy Mendez), estranged from his widower father; family friends Vero (Adriana Gaviria) and Pepe (René Granado); free-spirited aunt Ana (Jezabel Montero) and her younger boyfriend, Eric (Caleb Scott); and Manolito (Ruben Rabasa), Jesus’ oldest friend from Cuba, who is struggling with cognitive impairment. In the second act, family and friends have come together again for Nochebuena, and much has changed. Mati isn’t seen, yet he’s omnipresent. Ana’s on her own, but Ramoncito has brought Anthony (also played by Scott), a “friend” from work. Manolito is obviously worse, and the old Westchester house is continuing to fall apart. Most significantly, the realistic tone of the first act shifts into intricately staged absurdist theater. Carbonell Award-winning designers Christopher and Justin Swader enhance that tonal shift with their dining room set, which is placed between an onstage audience seating area and the Colony’s standard seats. The themes and issues within “The Cubans” include parental expectations and disappointment, criticism and acceptance, the power of familial love and loss. And Cuba, always Cuba, with its pull and its multiple meanings to different generations.
Collado, who worked with Granado, Rabasa and Ruiz on “The Amparo Experience,” says the cast for Leon’s play features “titans of acting.” Rabasa, now 81, came to the United States in 1955, “before Fidel.” He has made dozens of movies, many with low budgets and no big star names. He is known as a great comic actor but turns tearful as he talks about playing a man exiled from Cuba, a man battling Alzheimer’s disease. “Manolito had to leave the country against his will. He knew no English. He had no family. Nobody,” says Rabasa, who then thinks about what might have been with his own career. “There are so many things I wanted to do. Maybe I couldn’t make it because of my English.” In the play, the mother-and-daughter characters played by Alvarez and Ruiz are at odds over Christy’s slow-to-start career. In life, the two actors have had different experiences in terms of family support for pursuing their acting dreams. “Like Christy, I’m a first-generation American. My mom is a dancer, but my whole life she said I should be a doctor or a lawyer, because she wanted me to have the American dream,” says Alvarez, who is married to Leon and is a fellow FIU grad. “I relate to Martica, who is very much like my mom and the women in my family,” Ruiz says. “But I started as an actress and dancer, and my mom would go to all my shows. She was in Cuba in the late 1930s and wanted to be an actress. She lived her dream through mine.” Puig, who like Ruiz was in the Miami New Drama world premiere of Carmen Pelaez’s play “Fake,” has an impressive body of work, from Broadway to Off-Broadway to regional theater and 14 productions at Miami’s historic Coconut Grove Playhouse. He recalls being deeply moved when he read “The Cubans.” “Michael’s writing got to me so much that I couldn’t stop crying when I read the second act,” he says. “I’ve been in over 200 plays, but I’ve only played a few Hispanic characters. Doing this [at Miami New Drama] is a dream.” Collado, who has spent the better part of two years working on “The Amparo Experience” (about the exile of the family that created Havana Club Rum) and “The Cubans,” has at times become emotional about being immersed in such deeply Cuban stories. But telling them is vital, she says.
“It has become clear to me what we as a community are avoiding. We’ve had to experience fear, paranoia, generational trauma. This house [in ‘The Cubans’] is the bubble that we built for ourselves,” she observes. “I’m getting more appreciation for those who came before us. That generation made a ton of sacrifices so that we can do this. If my dad hadn’t written a letter explaining what he went through on the Mariel boatlift, my view [of Cuban Miami] might be ‘Scarface.’” “The Cubans,” she adds, demonstrates that “Amparo” isn’t a “once-in-a-lifetime thing. These people are working on what they want to be working on.”"

Opera singers to celebrate African-American spirituals 
By Tracy Fields 

The African Heritage Cultural Arts Center, one of the area’s premier arts training institutions, will kick off Black History Month with a celebration of African-American spirituals presented by local opera singers. The “Art of a Spiritual” concert will take place at 7 p.m. Saturday in the center’s Sandrell Rivers Theater. Among the singers is baritone Angel Refusé, the Miami Northwestern Senior High graduate who trained at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee and at the African Heritage Cultural Arts Center. This concert was his idea.
“One of the things that is most exciting is exposing people to the art form,” he said. Though some may think of spirituals as gospel music, spirituals are older by six to eight decades, he said. And the depth of spirituals may be surprising. The songs, technically complex, are religious on the surface, but they were also used to protest the living conditions of those who first composed them: enslaved people. Spirituals served as coded messages for those seeking to escape bondage. Notable examples are “Go Down, Moses,” “Wade in the Water,” and “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.” But there’s even more to them, Refusé explained. He tells a story of American composer Jester Hairston working with a group of singers on his spiritual, “Amen,” about the life of Jesus Christ. When the singers began to clap on the first measure, Hairston stopped them, according to Refusé, and instructed that they should clap only for the risen Lord, much further down in the song.
“That’s the kind of work the spiritual demands,” Refusé said. “Give it its respect.” Refusé has long been driven by his passion for music, according to Isis Roberts, director of the music department at the cultural arts center. Pursuing such a passion is not without challenges, especially for a young Afro-Latinx man in the classical arena, she said. “However, he never let the naysayers distract him,” said Roberts, adding that he continues to educate himself as well as younger artists while serving as an example of what dedication and hard work can bring. Roberts, a mezzo soprano, will perform in the concert as well, in addition to sopranos Erica Williams and Kyaunnee Richardson. Karl Van Richards will accompany them on piano. Richardson sang for President Barack Obama and others at the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C. Also performing in “Art of a Spiritual” is the center’s Voices of Heritage ensemble, to which Refusé once belonged. This group consists of 9- to 16-year-olds who are studying classical, jazz, R&B, folk and ethnic and gospel music in preparation for becoming professional vocalists. Refusé said he considers the Black History Month performance a celebration not only of the music but of its composers, those who came before. In his opinion, “the best reparation we can give our ancestors is to venerate them properly. Give their literature the time of day. Take it seriously and give it everything you’ve got.”"

‘American Dirt’ author’s book tour canceled due to ‘specific threats’ to booksellers
By Connie Ogle

The “American Dirt” book tour just got buried. Publisher Flatiron Books announced Wednesday that it will cancel the rest of the tour of author Jeanine Cummins, whose controversial novel about a mother and son fleeing a Mexican cartel provoked questions of cultural appropriation. Cummins, also author of two other novels and the memoir, was scheduled to appear at Books & Books in Coral Gables on Feb. 10. The book inspired outrage among writers, bloggers and columnists who criticized the book as clumsy and exploitative and not representative of Mexico or Mexicans. The novel was also initially praised by such authors as Sandra Cisneros, Stephen King, Julia Alvarez and Don Winslow, who wrote a series of books about cartels on the border. When asked about the cancellation, Books & Books owner Mitchell Kaplan said simply, “I’m sorry that it has come to this.” In a statement, Bob Miller, publisher and president of Flatiron Books, cited safety concerns as the reason to cancel the tour.
“Based on specific threats to booksellers and the author, we believe there exists real peril to their safety,” the publishing house said in a statement. The statement also acknowledged surprised by the reaction of the “Latinx and publishing committees.” “The fact that we were surprised is indicative of a problem, which is that in positioning this novel, we failed to acknowledge our own limits. The discussion around this book has exposed deep inadequacies in how we at Flatiron Books address issues of representation, both in the books we publish and in the teams that work on them. We are committed to finding new ways to address these issues and the specific publishing choices underlying this publication, and feel an obligation to our colleagues, readers, and authors alike. On a more specific scale we made serious mistakes in the way we rolled out this book. We should never have claimed that it was a novel that defined the migrant experience; we should not have said that Jeanine’s husband was an undocumented immigrant while not specifying that he was from Ireland; we should not have had a centerpiece at our bookseller dinner last May that replicated the book jacket so tastelessly. We can now see how insensitive those and other decisions were, and we regret them. “ “Simply put, we wish to listen, learn and do better. But that also must include a two-way dialogue characterized by respect. Jeanine Cummins spent five years of her life writing this book with the intent to shine a spotlight on tragedies facing immigrants. For that reason, it’s unfortunate that she is the recipient of hatred from the very communities she sought to honor. . . . . We are saddened that a work of fiction that was well-intentioned has led to such vitriolic rancor. While there are valid criticisms around our promotion of this book that is no excuse for the fact that in some cases there have been threats of physical violence. We join with those in the Latinx community and others who have spoken out against such violence.” Oprah Winfrey also chose “American Dirt” for her book club, calling it a “heart-wrenching page-turner” prompting a petition by 83 writers to ask her to reconsider her choice.
Flatiron says it is organizing a series of townhall meetings where Cummins will join groups with objections to the book. Meanwhile, it’s no. 1 on Amazon this week."

Amid backlash against Black Lives Matter, Afro-Latinos find setbacks and opportunities
By Lautaro Grinspan

For South Florida native Yvonne Rodriguez, being Black in West Miami means coming in frequent contact with her white Hispanic neighbors’ casual racism, be it in the form of “off-putting jokes” or uncomfortable appellations (“What’s up, mulata? What’s up, mi negra?”). Even as a second-generation Cuban American, Rodriguez finds her Latin identity, and her ties to her parents’ homeland, put under constant questioning. “It is psychologically exhausting to try to convince someone that you are just as much of a Latino as them,” she said. In the summer of 2020, when a diverse cross-section of Miamians mobilized in near-daily protests to demand justice after the police killing of George Floyd, some Afro-Latinos expressed hope that a meaningful racial reckoning could be on the horizon for Miami’s Hispanic community. But Rodriguez wasn’t among them. “I was not even mildly optimistic,” she said. To an extent, Rodriguez feels she was proven right: Local Hispanic backlash against the wave of summertime activism materialized almost immediately — and has carried on through the November election and into 2021, thanks in part to alarmist rhetoric on social media and on the airwaves of influential Spanish-language media outlets.
Within weeks of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, a much-discussed counterprotest to Black Lives Matter demonstrations was organized by the group Cubans4Trump in Miami Lakes, an overwhelmingly white Hispanic town. In that rally, as well as in other pro-Trump gatherings over the course of election season (including a “Law and Order” rally held in July), flags from Latin American countries were flown alongside the “thin blue line” flag, a symbol of support for law enforcement that has come to also signal opposition to Black Lives Matter and has been associated with white supremacist groups.
“They were literally carrying signs saying Black Lives Matter es socialista, es comunista,” said Raymond Adderly, an Afro-Cuban in Miami and one of the co-founders of Cubanos Pa’Lante, an alliance of progressive Cuban Americans. “That was the reality of Miami in the summer and all the way up until November, and even now.” In the wake of the civil unrest sparked by Floyd’s killing, some Spanish-language media personalities repeatedly insinuated that those who protest violence are untrustworthy or dangerous. That includes radio host Carines Moncada, who made national news in October when she claimed on Actualidad Radio, Miami’s most popular AM radio station, that a co-founder of Black Lives Matter practiced “brujería,” or witchcraft. “So you ask yourself, ‘Why are they destructive?’ ” Moncada said, in reference to protesters. “Because they are vibrating with the devil. They are vibrating with negativity. They are vibrating with the dark.”
In January, after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, some in Miami’s Spanish-language media falsely claimed that Black Lives Matter and far-left groups like antifa were to blame for the chaos. In their respective coverage of the Capitol insurrection, Moncada’s co-host, Agustin Acosta, and popular Cuban YouTube influencer Alexander Otaola both stressed that the violence in D.C. paled in comparison to the unrest last summer (experts have called such comparisons “false equivalencies”).
“It’s very hostile content because it creates divisiveness and pits people against each other. … But in Miami, in South Florida, that’s king. They love doing that.” Surveying the response to the Black Lives Matter movement across vast swaths of the local Hispanic population, Rodriguez’s assessment is incisive: “There’s been a complete backlash,” she said. White Hispanics’ view of Blackness “hasn’t gotten any better at all.” “You crazy?” she added. “It’s gotten worse.” Rodriguez feels that regression in the ways she is surveilled and profiled in her own neighborhood. “Before at least they weren’t as obvious. Now, they are looking us up and down, like they’re making a police report. … And that hurts me. You know, I live in a Hispanic community. My people are the Hispanics. So these are my neighbors looking at me like this.” For Matos Rondón, challenges unique to South Florida — where systemic racism combines with deep-seated colorism issues imported from Latin America — mean that a real racial reckoning could be more out of reach here than in other places. “I mean, you do the work in the hopes that things change, but you’re not naive about it,” she said. “Last year was the Big Bang of anti-racism curriculum. Everybody wanted a presentation. Everybody wanted a panel. … And then elections ramped up and all of that was dropped and things stayed exactly the same.”
DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM BLACK LIVES MATTER BACKLASH Leilani Bruce was born in Miami to a Cuban mom and a Jamaican dad. She considers herself to be “afro-caribeña,” or Afro-Caribbean, and has traveled to Cuba regularly — her most recent visit was in February 2020, when she took part in a CubaOne Foundation trip focused on Afro-Cuban culture and history. “Cubans often have the narrative that there’s no racism in Cuba, which is not true, and what that does is undermine the Afro-Cuban influence on Cuban culture,” she said. “So I think that [trip] got me started thinking about that and wanting to learn more about that part of the culture.” Bruce decided to more seriously explore that interest, and bring others alongside her in that exploration, after witnessing the local reaction to the summertime protests in Miami. In the fall she helped launch the Candela book club, which centers around Black voices and Afro-Cuban stories (the name of the book club, which means flame in Spanish, is an acronym: it stands for Cuban-American Narratives and Dialogues for Equity, Liberation and Allyship). “This summer, seeing how a lot of Cuban Americans were counter-Black Lives Matter and calling them terrorists and all kinds of things and just having a very racist attitude towards the whole movement, that started to get people talking,” said Bruce. The book club is a way to “drive the conversation forward and, learn about Afro-Cuban history, and unpack some of the issues around race in the Cuban community.”
The book club — which currently boasts more than 100 members, most of them Cuban American — meets virtually every six weeks to discuss books that grapple with the Black experience in Cuba and in the Cuban diaspora. Participants have free rein to also bring up and discuss race-related issues they have encountered in their own lives or within their own families and communities. Books covered so far include “The Power of Race in Cuba,” by Afro-Puerto_Rican professor Danielle Pilar Clealand; “Antiracism in Cuba: The Unfinished Revolution,” by Devyn Spence Benson; and “Black Pedro Pan,” by Ricardo Gonzalez Zayas, one of the few Black children who participated in Operation Pedro Pan, the exodus of thousands of Cuban minors to the U.S. in the 1960s. In March, the Candela book club will tackle “Miami’s Forgotten Cubans,” which chronicles the obstacles faced by Black Cuban immigrants in South Florida relative to their white counterparts.
In some ways, Candela is emblematic of the lasting impact that has come out of the 2020 protests in Hispanic-dominated Miami, especially among young people in progressive Latino circles: the use of online platforms and social media to keep addressing the issue of race and racism, even in the face of backlash elsewhere. “I think I’ve seen in the last six to eight months more than ever a lot more conversations happening online about racism in the Latin American community, and the need to acknowledge Afro cultures and talk to racist family members, things like that,” said Bruce. “So I think these are small but significant things that I didn’t really see before.” Marley Pulido-Vargas, who helped create the group Cubanos Pa’lante and is also Afro-Cuban, agrees. “I think there is a long way to go … but what I have seen and what I love the most is that there’s a lot more Afro-Cubans and Afro-Latinos in Miami pushing and creating more spaces where they feel seen, and we are not letting white Cubans or white Latinx people dominate the conversation, because what they often do is say that we don’t need to talk about race,” he said. “Black folks have been reclaiming the narrative.” BLACK HISTORY MONTH AS A CONVERSATION STARTER A historian by training, Pulido-Vargas has helped orchestrate Cubanos Pa’lante’s Black History Month initiative: Throughout the month of February, the group’s Facebook page has been posting about Afro-Cuban history makers, in part to “make sure that our stories are not invisible anymore.” “Black History Month is an opportunity to understand that Cuban history and Cuban-American history is Black history,” added Pulido-Vargas. Among the historical figures discussed on the Facebook page are Paulina Pedroso and Antonio Maceo, prominent leaders in the Cuban War of Independence.
Cubanos Pa’lante’s Facebook project is seen as a course correction to the oftentimes reductive representation of Afro-Latinos in media coverage during Black History Month — and throughout the rest of the year. “They uplift the same figures every time,” said Matos Rondón. “You got the all-stars like Celia Cruz and [Puerto_Rican baseball Hall of Famer] Roberto Clemente. You’re literally going to get Don Omar, Tego Calderón and Ozuna. … So there’s very strategic ways of highlighting the levels of Blackness that people want to see. But you know, there’s more than just people that entertain you. “For instance, the person that originated the idea of Afro-diasporic studies was Arturo Schomburg,” a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance. “He was a Black Puerto_Rican man and he’s basically the father of Black archiving.” Adderly, from Cubanos Pa’lante, would also welcome more nuance when it comes to discussing Black stories in the Hispanic context.
“It’s more than Celia. It’s my story. It’s my grandma’s story. It’s her family’s story. Like, I just found out recently that my grandma’s family were slaves on the island in Cuba, not slaves in the U.S.,” he said. “That’s a story to tell, you know, and it’s not being told because it’s overshadowed by the white Cuban story of success in Miami and how they’re able to open up a business and a shop.” Black History Month celebrations — which, according to Rodriguez, have only “recently started to mention Black Latinos” — could be an opportunity to drive home the relevance of the Black experience to the U.S. Hispanic population, nearly a quarter of which identifies as Afro-Latino or Afro-Caribbean. “None of the problems that Black Americans face in the U.S. are foreign to us. We also face racial profiling and police abuse of power and lack of representation,” said Pulido-Vargas. “So [during] Black History Month ... we have to work a little bit harder, so people know that we also exist and that systemic racism is no stranger to us.”"

‘I thought it was a prank.’ Puerto_Rican born Miami author wins $50,000 literary award
By Connie Ogle

While coronavirus dominates the headlines, a Miami writer got some of the best news a writer can get - which is good news for readers everywhere. Puerto_Rican born Jaquira Diaz, author of the memoir “Ordinary Girls,” has won a prestigious Whiting Award for emerging writers. Diaz, whose harrowing book details her early childhood in Puerto_Rico and her troubled adolescence growing up in Miami Beach, is one of two nonfiction winners (the other is Jia Tolentino, whose debut collection is “Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion”). “Ordinary Girls” deals with Diaz’s impoverished childhood and her eventual coming out, her mother’s mental illness and the violence of a South Beach that barely resembles the glamorous wonderland seen on screen. Diaz, who was forced to cancel half of her book tour events due to the coronavirus pandemic, says she still can’t quite believe it.
“To be honest I thought it was a prank,” she says, laughing. “When I got the call, I was getting on a plane flight to Miami. I was in the middle of my book tour. . . . I was walking and trying to put my luggage up and I was like, ‘What?’ “ On a serious note, she hopes this award helps to shine a light on the hard work of Latinx writers, just two months after the literary controversy over the publication of Jeanine Cumins’ “American Dirt” brought many Latinx writers together. “I hope that it means that people are taking us seriously and paying attention to Latinx writers, seeing us for who we really are and not one homogeneous group,” she says. “We’re different people from different cultures, with different histories. We come from different backgrounds. This is just one story. I’m just one writer.” The $50,000 prize was also awarded to Andrea Lawlor, Ling Ma and Genevieve Sly Crane (fiction); Will Arbery (drama); and Aria Aber, Jake Skeets, Genya Turovskaya and Diannely Antigua (poetry). The Whiting Award, which was established in 1985, offers one of the largest monetary gifts in the literary spectrum. More than 300 writers have received a total of $8 million in awards. Previous winners include Colson Whitehead, Tony Kushner, August Wilson, Susan-Lori Parks, Alice McDermott, ZZ Packer, Mary Karr, Ocean Vuong, Deborah Eisenberg, Tracy K. Smith, Denis Johnson, Jonathan Franzen and Jeffrey Eugenides.
As for what’s next for Diaz, she’s doing what writers do: self isolating - and writing. “I definitely feel it’s important to remember we were working and writing before and after ‘American Dirt,’ and we’ll keep working and writing before and after this pandemic.”"

The Miami Heat’s Andre Iguodala knows Zoom well. He’s an investor in the company
By Anthony Chiang

Veteran Miami Heat forward Andre Iguodala knows the Zoom remote conferencing platform well. Not only does he participate in the Heat’s team workouts through Zoom amid the coronavirus pandemic, but he’s also a Zoom investor. “Why didn’t I put in more money,” Iguodala said to Bill Shea of The Athletic. “That’s one of the few companies that became a household name, a staple name.” With many working from home during the pandemic, Zoom has become a popular way to hold virtual meetings. “Everyone is going to the best platform for that, which is Zoom,” Iguodala said to The Athletic. “Everyone has a need for it. I look at it as the ultimate business platform.”
Iguodala, who is spending the NBA shutdown with his family on the West Coast where he has a home in the San Francisco Bay Area, has actually invested in various companies. The 36-year-old is also part of the Catalyst Fund, which is a part of Comcast Ventures and invests money into companies led by African Americans, Latinx and women. As for Zoom, Iguodala met the company’s founder Eric Yuan at a tech conference and was impressed enough to invest. “You have to know people, personalities and temperament,” Iguodala said to The Athletic. “I saw great qualities in him as a person. We were able to link up for a few minutes, and we hit it off right away.” Iguodala, who has averaged 4.4 points while shooting 37.5 percent on threes, 3.8 rebounds and two assists in 14 games since he was traded to the Heat in February, has advice for those interested in basic investing. “You have to be willing to take a loss,” he said to The Athletic. “That’s something new investors have to learn. It’s like being in Vegas and betting at the craps table.”"

Nursing homes caring for mostly minorities twice as likely to have COVID-19 outbreaks
By Katie Camero

The novel coronavirus has long preyed on older adults for their weakened ability to fight off microbial threats, but as more case and death data are released, problems rooted deep in systemic inequality are coming to light faster than ever before. Now, a new analysis reveals that nursing homes with predominantly minority, nonwhite residents are more than twice as likely to house coronavirus cases and deaths than homes with mostly white residents. The research was discussed last week during a hearing with the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging in a session called “Caring for Seniors Amid the COVID-19 Crisis.” “The patterns of infections and deaths are not random,” Dr. Tamara Konetzka, a professor of health services research at the University of Chicago who conducted the analysis, said in her submitted testimony to the Senate. “Consistent with racial and socioeconomic disparities in long-term care historically and in pandemic-related deaths currently, nursing homes with traditionally underserved populations are bearing the worst outcomes,” she added.
About eight out of every 10 coronavirus deaths reported in the U.S. have been adults 65 years of age and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Older adults are known to have naturally weaker immune systems than their younger counterparts, and they tend to have more underlying health conditions such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure as a result, making them more susceptible to coronavirus infection, experts say. What’s more, understaffed nursing homes have all these vulnerable individuals who need hourly hands-on care housed together, making social distancing nearly impossible and viral spread inevitable. When looked at it this way, the numbers make sense, but Konetzka wondered if some nursing homes were simply able to better manage themselves than others.
Konetzka worked with Rebecca Gorges, a doctoral student at the Harris School of Public Policy at UChicago, to study coronavirus cases from 5,527 nursing homes and death data from 3,461 nursing homes in 12 different states including California, Colorado and Georgia, according to the testimony. The pair studied the homes’ “star ratings,” status as for profit or nonprofit and resident characteristics. The researchers found that “nursing homes with the lowest percent of white residents were more than twice as likely to have COVID-19 cases or deaths as those with the highest percent white residents,” the testimony said. The results showed “only a marginally lower probability of cases” for homes with higher star ratings, and no differences in COVID-19 cases between profit and nonprofit homes. And because people want to stay as close to home as possible, the nursing homes individuals live in are “often a reflection of the neighborhoods” they are located in, Konetzka said. Therefore, there is a “strong and consistent relationship between race and the probability of COVID-19 cases and deaths,” the testimony said. Minorities have long suffered from health disparities, injustice A Washington Post analysis found similar results in minority populations outside of nursing homes. “Majority of black counties have three times the rate of infections and nearly six times the rate of deaths as majority white counties,” the analysis said. One reason is that black Americans tend to have higher rates of underlying health conditions and less access to healthcare. A 2014 study showed that hospitals in predominantly black neighborhoods were more likely to shut down than those in whiter areas. A woman, who says she is a nurse in New York, took to social media to express her frustrations over her hospital’s handling of minority patients, claiming “[staff] are gonna let them rot on the bed; they are medically mismanaging these patients.”
The nurse goes on to explain several scenarios of “gross negligence” that have left minorities dead on their beds for unknown amounts of time, and says that no one cares to help them. “Literally, black lives don’t matter here,” the nurse said in tears. The Washington Post analysis also mentioned that black people are more likely to have “essential” jobs such as in the hotel and food industry that make them more vulnerable to community coronavirus spread. Another longtime issue has been housing disparities among minorities who are more likely to live in densely packed neighborhoods with multiple families, an environment that can more easily facilitate viral spread. A 2017 study from Princeton University discovered that black children living in older buildings infested with rodent droppings and near air-polluted highways are more likely to suffer from asthma. A separate NPR analysis looked at 78 nursing homes in New York and found that seven of the 11 homes with the highest number of deaths had 46% or more residents of color— black or latinx. Konetzka proposed that regular and rapid testing is needed for all nursing home staff and residents in order to help curb COVID-19 spread. She also said staff must be adequately numbered and provided with appropriate and sufficient personal protective equipment. “Health disparities have always existed for the African American community,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, leading epidemiologist in the White House coronavirus task force, said in April, according to the Washington Post. “But here again with the crisis now — it’s shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is.”"

Black and Latinx people will get 30% of new US jobs at Adidas, Reebok, company says
By Dawson White

Thirty percent of new U.S. jobs at Adidas and Reebok will go to black and Latinx people, the company said Tuesday. The company also says it will invest in the black community and in university scholarships for black employees, according to a news release. “The events of the past two weeks have caused all of us to reflect on what we can do to confront the cultural and systemic forces that sustain racism,” CEO Kasper Rorsted said in the release. “We have had to look inward to ourselves as individuals and our organization and reflect on systems that disadvantage and silence black individuals and communities.” George Floyd, a black man, died while in police custody on May 25 and his death sparked an avalanche of protests across the nation. He died after now-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Three other officers didn’t intervene. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He remains jailed with bail set at $1.25 million. Officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao were also fired and arrested, charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
Adidas said it will invest $20 million over the next four years in programs that empower and support the black community, including a basketball platform for under-served communities and a design school that provides a pathway for careers in footwear design, the release said. Adidas also said it would finance 50 university scholarships for black employees over the next five years, according to the release. “While we have talked about the importance of inclusion, we must do more to create an environment in which all of our employees feel safe, heard and have equal opportunity to advance their careers,” Rorsted said in the release. “As adidas, we will create a lasting change and we will do it now.” The move comes after Footwear News reported last week that 150 employees between company’s Portland, Oregon, and Germany offices were calling on the company to better support its black employees. The group urged the company to ensure that 31% of workers at every level of the organization are black or Latinx by Dec. 31, 2021, as well as implement a new hiring policy that requires black and Latinx people to be interviewed for every open position, according to Footwear News.
“It’s frustrating to see images of black women around the brand, wearing the clothing and wearing the shoes but there’s nobody that looks like me that is there” designing the products, Julia Bond told Oregon Live. Bond is the only black female designer at Adidas’ Portland headquarters, according to the outlet, and has helped lead protests at the offices. “I see the potential this brand has to do the right thing and be a leader,” Bond told Live. “I see the potential to do very good work, but it starts with Adidas apologizing.” Some Adidas employees thought the company’s statements on the death of Floyd were at odds with representation and support for black employees within the company, the Wall Street Journal reported. Adidas made posts on Twitter and Instagram. Aric Armon, a footwear designer at the Portland office, said the statements, “don’t necessarily align with how anybody feels internally about the things that (Adidas) does to help support black people,” he told the Wall Street Journal.
Adidas responded to the backlash promising change. “We recognize that we have not done enough and we are dedicated to doing more,” Adidas said, according to the Journal."

‘Latinos must acknowledge our own racism, then we must pledge to fight it’
By Stephanie Valencia and Denise Collazo 

“The heartbeat of racism is denial. The heartbeat of anti-racism is confession.” Ibram X. Kendi In the days after George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, we have seen thousands of people protest across the country demanding change. They are a result of inhumane and unjust systems that have wreaked havoc on black communities for generations and leadership that has failed to hold police accountable. The protests come amid a global pandemic that has disproportionately affected the health and economic well being of millions of African-American and Latino people, who are dying at twice the rate of the rest of the population. It will take decades for our communities to recover from the destabilization. This moment should serve as yet another wake-up call to the insidiousness of anti-blackness built into the fabric of our society.
Today, we say unequivocally: Black lives matter! We commit to stand alongside the black community and fight for justice with them. We demand deep structural reform to address the problem of police violence and police accountability, racial inequality, and opportunity gaps. All policies must be on the table — including defunding of police and investment in communities of color so they don’t just survive, but thrive. While we must hold President Trump and other leaders accountable, we must ask ourselves how our own actions contribute to racism and colorism in this country. Our collective inaction and silence contributed to the lynchings of Michael Brown, Pamela Turner, Laquan McDonald, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, Sean Reed and George Floyd. Add to that list this many Latinos who also have been killed at the hands of the state: Reefa Hernandez, Antonio Arce, Francisco Serna, Anthony Baez, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, Jessie Hernandez, David Silva and, most recently, Sean Monterrossa, who was peacefully protesting in Vallejo, California. We have failed to grapple with anti-blackness that exists in our own community. As Latinx, we are descendants of many countries. According to the Pew Research Center, one quarter of U.S. Latinos identify as Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean or of African descent with roots in Latin America. Many in our community benefit from the privilege or illusion of proximity to whiteness,without acknowledging the depth of our own African diaspora. We have been raised in families who refer to blackness in the diminutive (morenita, negrita, prietita). We have remained silent when our tias have encouraged us to partner with people who have lighter skin than we do so we can mejorar la raza. We have hated ourselves for our skin color, hair texture, our curves and our accents. Our faith traditions, the schools we attend, the families we love, the music we listen to are anchored in blackness and our indigenous roots, but we obscure that with whiteness.Racism has influenced our own American experience. Our country was founded on stolen Native American land and the stolen labor of the enslaved. Generations of injustices have left us with prison systems that disproportionately cage and dehumanize black and brown people; systems, laws, and socially expected behaviors that reinforce this basic idea. As Latinx, we have experienced America’s hate when our children have been put in cages and our families are ripped out of our lives and deported. Hate is the reason that our immigrant family members are deemed as COVID-19 ‘essential’ but not noticed as ‘heroes.’ We felt it in the shameful response to disasters in Puerto_Rico. Last week, we saw on live television when Omar Jimenez, an Afro-Latino CNN reporter was arrested while doing his job. The path to healing starts with acknowledgment. Next must come action. We, the undersigned, are announcing the following commitments: We commit to standing with the black community in saying unequivocally, that Black Lives Matter. We will take direction from black organizers in our response to anti-black police violence. All signatories to this letter have donated to organizations that are black-led and black-centered. We commit to hold all politicians at every level of government accountable, for advancing bold, structural change. We will challenge them when they stand in the way. We commit to include ending anti-black racism in our legislative priorities. This means fighting for policies to end police brutality, promote economic policies that address racial inequities and opportunity gaps and push to overhaul legal systems (voting rights, private prisons, bail bonds) that benefit and profiteer from black, brown and immigrant oppression. We commit to starting the process of acknowledgment and healing of racism and colorism within our own community and families. We will act on ways that have allowed anti-blackness to stand in our own families, communities, and institutions. We will dedicate resources to raise consciousness and disrupt anti-Blackness within our own organizations. We hold our Spanish-language and Latino-focused media accountable for how they use their platforms to dismantle racism, colorism and anti-blackness in our own Latino community. We demand that Spanish-language media tell the stories of Afro-Latino people and the discrimination they face and include more Afro-Latino voices in front of and behind the camera.Over the coming months, there will be many attempts to divide black and brown communities. In order to build the society that we want, where opportunity is for everyone and our communities are liberated from oppression that binds us, we must come together as we have in the past and fight together, united."

A message to their sons —You are loved and smart, but you must fight for racial justice
By Maya Lora, Caroline Ghisolfi, and C. Isaiah Smalls II 

As cities and towns around the world hold anti-racism protests, parents are struggling to explain the moment to their children as they watch it unfold on TV and outside their windows. Three South Florida dads are making those difficult conversations a priority, even though their young children may not fully understand the injustices their fathers want to help them see. Jerry Rateau, a restaurant cook and son of a hard-working Haitian immigrant, was forced to talk to his 7-year-old son after he inadvertently watched George Floyd’s death on TV. Danny Flores, a musician who picked up his skills from a formerly drug-addicted father, is using music to connect the Hispanic and Black communities and teach his own sons love and acceptance. And Corey Patterson, though his son is only 18 months old, has turned to Instagram to fight stereotypes about Black fathers and show his son how to thrive in the world.
“Fatherhood is important ... regardless of what type of home you come up with, having a male figure is really important,” Flores said. “I remember there were many times in my childhood where I wish my dad was there and was sober and was effective and was coherent.” Holly Zwerling, CEO and president of the Fatherhood Task Force of South Florida, said fathers play a powerful role in making the world better for their children. All three fathers are involved in the task force, which aims to bolster fatherhood involvement in children’s lives. “I want more fathers to take on this issue of racial justice. I want more fathers to be advocates,” Zwerling said. “Dads really need to become leaders ... and leaders for their children, so their children can advocate. The children see their dads advocating and they too will become future advocates.” Explaining George Floyd’s death to a 7 year old As George Floyd called to his “Mama,” 7-year-old Jeremiah Rateau, who was watching from the living room of his North Miami home, turned to his dad, Jerry Rateau.
“What? They killed that man? Daddy, I thought police was good guys.” The 37-year-old fry cook was staring at the news broadcast, too shocked to realize his son had slipped out of his room to be seared with the image of a police officer suffocating a Black man to death. “There’s a time to have certain conversations with your children and police brutality was not something I thought I had to address with him at 7 years old,” Rateau said. “But… it had to be faced; it had to be spoken.” MIA_Fathers_Day_MJO_1
With protesters taking to the streets and making the world turn its attention to systemic racism, Rateau said this Father’s Day every father and child should be having conversations about civil rights and law enforcement, and what it means to be Black in America. Rateau said being a father for the past seven years has meant carving time to play Jenga on “family game day” with Jeremiah and his wife Cindy, bonding with his son over video-game feuds and building rocky forts that take over their living room before rushing to his late-night shifts at Bahama Breeze in North Miami. But Floyd’s killing, Rateau said, has served as a reminder that being committed to fatherhood also means having difficult conversations about how a Black child should interact with the police, what a human rights violation is and why the homicide committed by one officer in uniform shouldn’t define all police. Rateau said Floyd’s death should be a teachable moment for all children to understand basic tenets: “They have the right to equality. They have a right to a voice. They have a right to speak. They have a right to not be abused.” And, he told his son, “You have a right to jog down the street without being followed,” referencing the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man shot to death by a white man while jogging in a south Georgia neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon in February.
Rateau’s father, a Haitian immigrant who worked long days and late nights to get food on the table, often didn’t have a chance to sit him down and have those conversations. Raul Garcia, 37, who lived next door to Rateau as a child and has been his friend for 31 years, said they both grew up with absent fathers. Rateau broke out of that pattern and inspired Garcia to do the same. Rateau helped him realize, Garcia said, that, “At the end of the day you’ve got to be a dad… (and) that doesn’t just mean providing for your kids but being there to teach them life lessons”— even in the midst of a pandemic and while mourning the death of yet another unarmed Black man killed by a police officer. “To stop it [police brutality] from happening all around the country… we need to speak it, we need to live it: This will not happen (to my son),” Rateau said, leaning against Jeremiah and holding his face close to his chest. Caroline Ghisolfi Music as the connector to family, the community On Danny Flores’ piano, his instrument of choice, sits a Polaroid of him, his father and his two siblings: a testament to how far the family, particularly Flores’ father, have come. At just 8 years old, Flores, 41, watched his father battle a crack cocaine addiction. His father, Daniel Flores, was verbally abusive toward the family, popping in and out of their lives. But one thing remained constant between the father and son: music. The father, a music director, instructed his son to pick up the piano, having him play gigs at restaurants and nightclubs. Flores has since turned that skill into a career as one half of the Puerto_Rican, Grammy-nominated duo known as COASTCITY, for which Flores produces as well as plays keys and sings backup. “It’s ironic because although he had this addiction and he obviously made some really poor choices in his life, he still somehow tried to have some sort of relationship with me,” Flores said. “Sometimes, it was a bit abusive. And some of it ... came from the heart.”
The senior Flores, now sober and living in Orlando, is a devoted grandfather to Flores’ two sons. Flores said his father, whom he called a “kind” and “beautiful” man outside of his addiction, grew up without a father himself. Flores said his dad was just trying to figure out how to “emote love to his children.” A generation later, Flores is working to do the same thing.
“I think I took the good stuff that my dad demonstrated and I took also his mistakes and turned those things around,” Flores said. “A lot of times kids that come from a broken home, they end up in addictions ... I ran away from it because I saw how awful [it was], how that destroys a human being and how it can destroy a family.” Flores’s COASTCITY partner, Jean Rodriguez, said Flores is a devoted dad. The two have been working afternoons and nights so Flores can watch his two children — Lucas, 5, and Noah, 3 — while his wife, Yaritza, 34, works during the day. “Always, since day one, he’s all about the family,” said Rodriguez, 39.
Whether Flores’ children will follow in their father’s musical footsteps is up for debate. As his father strums “Guajira Guantanamera” on the piano in the family’s Coral Gables home, Noah bangs on random keys alongside him, his giggles echoing twice as loud as his father’s voice. Lucas is slightly more disciplined, laying his hands on top of his father’s and playing along as he snuggles into his lap. The two play the recently released COASTCITY song, “Lullaby.” Flores and Rodriguez wrote the song three years ago. Rodriguez said the song flowed out of “true, honest emotion” while the pair were out doing a promo tour, separated from their kids. The music video features cameos from Latinx stars and their children, including Ricky Martin, Big Time Rush’s Carlos Peña and Luis Fonsi, who is Rodriguez’s brother. Rodriguez said the song is good for the current moment, with lockdowns triggered by the coronavirus as well as nationwide protests borne out of calls for justice after George Floyd’s killing. The protests inspired Flores to get involved with the Fatherhood Task Force of South Florida a few weeks ago. “I saw the [task force] was one organization that was actually very involved with the Black community,” Flores said. “And I also saw an opportunity for them to be able to be involved with the Hispanic community.”
For Flores, hard conversations about racism start in the home, even if his children’s age make their understanding limited. “We don’t judge, you know. We don’t create friendships just because of their color of their skin,” Flores said he tells his children. “We create friendships and we have proximity to people because they’re human beings.” Maya Lora Sending a message to his son For the past three weeks, Corey Patterson has ended his night the same way. He reads to his 18-month-old son Cole then asks him to repeat the following mantra: “I’m a king. I’m strong. I’m smart. I love you.”
Cole may not understand this — a toddler, he’s just learning how to use the bathroom. But at a time when Black Americans are battling the intertwined pandemics of COVID-19 and racism, the elder Patterson wants to equip his son with the tools to thrive in a world that will often try to pigeonhole him because of his skin color. “The power of those words, being said out loud, will always be with him,” said Patterson, 34. To Patterson, it’s all about changing the perception of Black fathers. His newly minted Instagram show, “Conversations with CP,” allows Patterson and other Black men to have an honest dialogue about fatherhood. “Especially in the Black community, I feel like representation is important,” Patterson said. “Sometimes in the media, whether it’s social media, television or radio, you don’t always get the opportunity to see Black fathers viewed in a positive light.”
A first-generation college graduate, Patterson didn’t come from a home where diplomas were mounted, framed and hung on plaster walls, a parchment imprimatur of society’s standing. Yet he gave his parents both his undergraduate and master’s diplomas. “Those things are not accomplished without them,” says Patterson, who lives with his family in Plantation.
He credits his parents with supporting him in the arduous process of becoming a certified public accountant, a field where Black Americans account for fewer than 1 percent, according to an article in Bloomberg Tax, citing statistics by the National Association of Black Accountants. Patterson also credits Edward Triangolo, whom he was introduced to more than 10 years ago after a Johnson & Wales University board of trustees meeting at the Fairmont Turnberry Isle Resort & Club in Aventura, where Patterson was working as a concierge. “He had a great attitude. He was someone who wanted to succeed and he was very attentive,” said Triangolo, 77, a former president of Johnson & Wales and a Fort Lauderdale accounting professional. Triangolo says fatherhood has only strengthened Patterson’s character. Patterson’s fiancée, Regina Grimner, chuckles at how she had initially wanted a girl to soften him up. But Cole has Patterson “eating out the palm of his hand.” “Some people are just people who happen to be parents and they parent with that in mind,” said Grimner, 29. “But I feel like Corey really tries to be the best parent he can be.” The affirmations, the Instagram show, the fatherhood-induced excitement are all part of Patterson’s legacy, a word he uses quite frequently. “Superman is cool. Batman’s cool. But no one’s better than dad,” he said."

We look to our mothers to save us from injustice and distress
By Jane Caputi

In times of greatest extremity, people cry out for their mothers. George Floyd, while being tortured and then killed by a white policeman, called out “Mama.” Hearing this, many instantly wept in recognition, as this calling to the mother touched on the universal experience of infant helplessness, need for care and the hope for succor and intervention. In her remarkable poem “Weather,” Claudia Rankine notes that the ongoing uprisings responding to systemic racism, police brutality and a gamut of related injustices are a continuing continuation of that crying out to a mother. This call is for the restoration of values of community, reciprocity, sharing, equity, caring, fairness, nourishment, love and continuance, which are very different from those of a father-first or patriarchal culture. Patriarchal values include authority, dominance, punishment and violent enforcement. These manifest broadly in the national symbolic father figure, Donald Trump. The 45th president stands his ground as a proudly unmasked proponent of white and male supremacy. His followers cheer the rule of someone with “balls” — tough, straight, manly and white, evincing a will to hurt, and with a sure sense of his own impunity. Trump famously bragged that if he shot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue, he would get away with it. I doubt he was thinking of that “someone” as being anyone like himself or his family. The same patriarchal values are manifestly operative in the death of George Floyd. The white policeman killed Floyd in full view of others. He must have known that a young woman was recording him. Nonetheless, he probably expected impunity as his birthright and because he was an official enforcer of the hierarchy. By contrasting mother-associated values to those of the patriarchal father, I am not setting up a binary opposition. Nor am I asserting that all mothers evince these qualities and values. Rather, I am describing a realizable ideal whereby the mother is not only a birth giver, but someone of any sex and gender who takes it as their calling to love, teach, help, lead, feed, console, protect, guide, decide and create family and community. This understanding of mothers and mothering power is common to human heritage and evident in many cultures, including Pueblo Native peoples and Black and Latinx trans and queer communities.
Mothers and their children are specifically endangered in the system that long has disregarded Black lives. A recent report in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted a disastrous effect of pollution and climate change on Black mothers and babies. Environmental racism enforces a reality where Black people live disproportionately in air-polluted areas. That, coupled with higher temperatures, puts pregnant women at risk of delivering premature, underweight or stillborn babies. Environmental injustices are the responsibility of the mostly white father figures who control world finance, corporations and militaries. Too often, it is just business as usual to exploit and poison peoples’ air, water, land, labor and natural resources. This, just as surely as a knee to the neck, chokes out life. The assault against mothers extends outward to the planet, whose ancient and still telling name is Mother Earth. The conjoined philosophical, spiritual and practical meanings of that appellation is that all of us (human and non-human) issue from a common source, are connected, mutually interdependent and essentially equal — worthy of love, respect, care, safety and living in conditions that allow flourishing. This is the same message of all social justice movements. The crisis of injustice — including racial, environmental, and sex- and gender-based — is all at once personal, community and planetary. As the righteous global uprisings demanding an end to systemic racism make clear, the time is now for a collective call to the mother. Mama. Call her. Act in her name."

Playwriting pair’s whale of a tale gets a big-time virtual reading 
By BY CHRISTINE DOLEN 

Musicals are typically the creation of composer-lyricist-book writer teams. On the other hand – although producing a play is a collaborative experience – dramas and comedies are nearly always the work of a solo playwright. “Jenna and the Whale,” which will get a high-profile virtual reading on Broadway On Demand at 5:30 p.m. June 30, is that rare exception: It’s a piece created by a pair of playwrights, Vanessa Garcia and Jake Cline. Garcia was the author behind the long-running, immersive Miami hit, “The Amparo Experience.” Cline was part of the South Florida Sun Sentinel team awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its illuminating and ongoing coverage of the deadly shooting rampage at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The two were paired creatively by William “Willie” Fernandez, the former Sun Sentinel managing editor who is now a New York producer and Zoetic Stage board member.
Fernandez, his Broadway United/Broadway Virtual producing partner, Jim Kierstead, and producer-director Conor Bagley were among the many Broadway producers of Matthew Lopez’s two-part “The Inheritance,” which won the 2020 Drama Desk Award for “Outstanding Play.” All three are now involved with “Jenna and the Whale” – with Fernandez teaming up the playwrights, Kierstead making the deal with Broadway On Demand, and Bagley directing the virtual reading. Also producing is Adriana Gaviria, whose New York-based arts/theater initiatives North Star Projects and The Sol Project will benefit from the reading. “Jenna and the Whale” mixes metaphor, realism, sorrow, humor and hope in a kind of dramatic fugue. It begins in the sloshing belly of a whale, a la the biblical story of Jonah and the whale. Surfer Jenna (Dianne Garriga) winds up there after going out on her board despite horrendous conditions. Inside the massive creature, she meets Jonah (Gabriel Bonilla), who breaks the news that he has been there for three years. Memory is easily and quickly erased in that dank, dark environment. Still, Jonah soon reminds Jenna of someone – her boyfriend, Patrick, who was lost to the ocean three years earlier under mysterious circumstances. In the course of the play, we meet Patrick’s mother, Rita (Orlagh Cassidy), a surf shop owner, and his complicated/charismatic sister, Coco (Rebecca Jimenez); as well as Jenna’s mother, Lynn (Rachel Pickup); and Deputy Tyler (Melissa Ann Hubicsak), a by-the-book type who finds Coco intriguing.
From an earlier pre-pandemic staged reading at Miami New Drama on Miami Beach, the playwrights got a sense of elements that needed changing, which they did before work progressed on the virtual reading. “We learned a lot, but we had way too little time,” Garcia says. “The play is a fugue, but you need time to work on it or the actors get stressed out.” Having worked with Garcia on “Amparo” and with Cline at the Sun Sentinel (and on his still-evolving first play, “Purple Hearts”), Fernandez thought the playwrights would be professionally compatible. “They have similar styles. They both have a gift for dialogue and heartfelt writing. And they’re both the nicest people – you meet them and fall in love with them,” he says. Cline and Garcia hit it off creatively when they followed up on the producer’s suggestion and met for drinks and conversation in July 2019 at The Mighty, a Miami bar on Coral Way, where Cline’s book club gathers. They swapped stories about what they’re each juggling. For Garcia, there’s a Ruben Rabasa solo show, a second novel, several screenplays, an adaptation of Carlos Eire’s “Waiting for Snow in Havana,” and the happy addition of a baby girl to her family. For Cline, who is also publications director at Miami’s Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, there are freelance pieces for The Atlantic and The Washington Post, a fellowship in the Playwright Development Program run by Miami-Dade County’s Department of Cultural Affairs, and ongoing work on plays, short stories and novellas. “Jake talked about things he was working on, including two novellas and a play. He told me the stories of all of them, and in one there was a whale that got beached,” Garcia says. “They were all set in Dunes Beach [a fictional Florida coastal town with good surfing], and the whale was the unifying factor,” Cline adds. “I’d been thinking about beachside towns. In my play, a man and a woman find themselves in the belly of a whale.”
Garcia sensed connections among the stories.
“As he talked, I saw them thread together. I wrote it all down and thought, ‘He’ll either hate it or we can work to make it one play,’” she says. “It started to grow. I could see it.” Of their collaboration, Garcia observes, “You can tell if it will work right away. Either it will flow, or it will fall apart. With Jake, it was flow, flow, flow.” Cline put together a playlist for inspiration. The songs by varied groups and artists (The Velvet Underground, Florence and the Machine, Sharon Van Etten, Laura Marling and others) aren’t in the play, but they’re character-specific, and both playwrights listened to them while crafting the script. “The entire time, I felt we were on the same wavelength,” says Cline, an avid surfer. The recorded Zoom reading on June 30, which will benefit the nonprofit North Star Projects (using the arts live and virtually to build community) and The Sol Project (an initiative to produce the work of Latinx playwrights), has been staged and edited by Bagley. The 2016 Yale University grad already has a string of New York and regional credits as both a director and producer, and he directed several of the entries in the virtual Miami Monologues series for the Arsht Center’s Arsht@Home.
“When I first got ‘Jenna and the Whale,’ I couldn’t put it down,” Bagley says. “I thought it was one of the best new plays I’ve read. The two playwrights were writing in a unified voice … I was really drawn to the story of a girl struggling with grief and finding her way in a tough world.” Of Garcia and Cline, Bagley says, “They’re very poetic writers with a supreme sense of beauty … The characters, five women and one man, all play such an integral role in the plot. Vanessa and Jake have a real great sense of both silly and dark humor, of levity and seriousness.” Bagley likes the fact that the play doesn’t definitively answer what is and isn’t real, that it mixes imagination and reality. Although he, like everyone else in theater, longs for a return to live performance, he thinks giving current theater fans and potential ones a virtual taste of new works is a good thing. Producer Fernandez loves learning about scripts from staged readings, and he thinks the Zoom model has a future even after the pandemic ends.
“It’s a great tool,” he says of the medium’s potential for sparking future productions. “Not every producer is based in New York. You film it, and people all over the place can watch it.” “We weren’t sure it would work on Zoom, but it does. I think it’s a really good way to get it out there,” Garcia says. Cline adds that he’s happy that, four months into this altered existence, arts lovers have become so accustomed to watching performances and readings online. And yet, says Garcia as she looks who-knows-how-far into the future, “I’ll be very excited to be in a live space again. Ooooh, it’s gonna be nice!”"

Q&A with VP contender Karen Bass: ‘When I’m asked to step up, I will.’
By David Catanese

Karen Bass didn’t appear on the public shortlist of vice presidential contenders until a few weeks ago, a possible indication that Joe Biden’s search for a running mate remains in flux a month before he’s expected to unveil his choice. The five-term California congresswoman, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and former speaker of the California Assembly boasts more career legislative experience than any other woman of color under consideration for the No. 2 slot. She’s currently trying to marshal Republican support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act — her sweeping reform bill that passed the House but faces much longer odds in the GOP-led Senate. In an interview with McClatchy, the 66-year-old Bass was cagey about where she stands in the running for running mate, but indicated she was willing to serve if called on and said Biden should “of course” select a minority candidate. While it’s unclear how Biden’s team is sizing her up against the likes of Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Val Demings, a former political adviser to Bass insisted she’s a serious contender — particularly since Biden’s vetting team approached her later in the process. “Any time they reopen something, nine times out of ten they’re extending it because they may not have what they want,” said the former adviser.
Even if she’s not selected for the Democratic ticket, Bass’ name is also increasingly being raised as a possible successor to Nancy Pelosi, who is a close ally. Below is the conversation with Bass, who spoke with McClatchy from Los Angeles. It has been edited for length and clarity. Q: I’m obliged to first ask you how advanced you are in Joe Biden’s vice presidential vetting process. A: Well, I’m obliged to tell you you’re going to have to talk to the campaign. How’s that? Fair enough? Q: Well, we’re always looking for more than that. When was the last time you spoke with Joe Biden?
A: The last time I spoke with him was last week, now that I mention it. He spoke at the Congressional Black Caucus weekly meeting so he talked to us last Wednesday and I spoke to him then. We talked about the Justice and Policing (Act), where we were with that and also COVID, those two things. It was not a campaign discussion. Q: Is he on board with your legislation? A: Well, we didn’t ask for that. But I certainly got the impression he was supportive, but I couldn’t say he told us, ‘I support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.’ Q: Your legislation bans chokeholds, no-knock warrants, makes lawsuits against police easier to bring about. What about the training piece? I’m curious how you think we can stop these incidents from escalating to deadly violence in the first place? A: I don’t believe you can disconnect the pieces. The bill overall tries to address changing police culture. If police officers know that they can be sued, if they know that they can be prosecuted, if they know that certain techniques they use are banned, if they know their colleagues are obliged to intervene, and then there’s training, all of it is together. I don’t believe there’s any one training program that magically would prevent it. We do want part of the training to be in de-escalation. But I think it’s important to look at it more as a package. Because I think all of those pieces contribute to cultural change. Q: Some Republicans say if you open up police to lawsuits, they are going to be less likely to act, less likely to potentially defend themselves. How do you respond to that critique?
A: I don’t think that critique is based on much. I think more highly of police officers than that. I think police officers view themselves as professionals that want to be held accountable and would prefer a situation where they’re not working in a culture that really penalizes you if you try to lift up the standards. That older man that was knocked down in New York, remember that? Do you remember one of the officers reaching over to help him? And another officer pulled him away. That’s the kind of cultural change we want to see ended. In George Floyd’s murder, those other officers that sat there and witnessed and helped. That’s the kind of culture we want to change. Q: Steep chances that this actually passes the Senate. Is this something you’re looking to do next year? A: You know it was interesting, when we had the debate in the committee and when we were doing the mark-up in the committee, my Republican colleagues went on for hours talking about everything under the sun but the bill. I view that as a point of encouragement, you follow me? Q: Even in the Senate you think so? A: When my Republican colleagues in the House tell me that they believe there’s support in the Senate, I have to believe them. Q: What about the issue of gun violence in cities, particularly Chicago, where there have been at least nine children killed in the past two weeks. Some say that’s an argument police need more support and more resources in these urban areas. What do you say to that? A: What I say to that is for the last 30 years … every time there’s violence, we say what’s needed are more police and that hasn’t solved it. So it would seem to me that you would want to begin to say what else is needed because that’s not working. I believe that you can stop violent crime. There’s a lot of different ways to do it, a lot of great examples but we refuse as a nation to invest in that. We have no problem at all investing in policing and incarceration and at some point we’ve got to say, we have been doing this for decades and it has not worked.
Q: The investment would go where then? A: You seek to solve that by using community members, you support community based programs. We have areas in Los Angeles that have suffered from gang violence. We talked to people in the area, we took former gang members, provided training and assistance to them and asked them to help us keep the peace. We built a solid relationship between the former gang members and the police and they worked together. And in Los Angeles, it has reduced violence crime. But even in Los Angeles, we have not made a comprehensive investment. We tend to fund community programs and then we cut them back and we tend to do that especially when they are accomplishing their goals. So it’s like, ‘Ok, the murder rate is down, we don’t need this anymore.’ We never sustain the investment. Q: Do you believe the president is potentially inciting a race war with some of his rhetoric? A: I think he is contributing to violence. It’s not what I think. Why don’t you look at October of 2018? The week before the last election there were four acts of domestic terrorism … when the president day after day after day talked about the invasion from Central America, sent troops to the border. And the problem I have is that people’s memories are very short and they don’t connect the dots. So what he is doing now is absolutely trying to instigate. I don’t know that he is trying to start a race war but I’m not sure whether that even matters. He is trying to fan the flames of racial hostility. He is trying to fan the flames of white people, to make them angry, angry and terrified of this new movement that has developed. In many cities, there’s more white people wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts than Black people. Q: Do you think an all white Democratic ticket risks depressing African American turnout?
A: I think what is happening right now in our country really calls for the diversity on the ticket. It’s not just about African American turnout. It’s turnout of the Latinx community, turnout of the Asian Pacific Islander community, turnout of the Native American community. The cry of the nation right now is for healing and diversity … and I think diversity is what this country needs right now. Q: So you think he should put a woman of color on the ticket? A: Of course. Q: What’s the better job: Speaker of the House or vice president? A: (Laughs) I mean, I don’t look at these as jobs per se. When I became speaker (of the California Assembly) I actually wanted to run for the state Senate. I wasn’t trying to be speaker. I became speaker because my colleagues really pushed me to step up. And so, when I’m asked to step up, I will. I don’t really pursue titles from a pure ambition point of view so I don’t even think about it as which job. Q: Would you like to be vice president? A: You know, like I said, and I realize that it’s hard, people don’t take it sincerely and I think it’s sad, I think it’s kind of testament to where we are in our political process but, I am so concerned about this country, I’m willing to step up to do anything to right this ship that has gone so far off course. I just can’t say it any other way."

Miami-Dade could have historic election for women in 19th Amendment’s centennial year
By Maya Lora

When Raquel Regalado ran for her first elected position on the Miami-Dade County Public School Board in 2010, she said she was questioned at every turn — but not because of her qualifications. People seemed to be mostly concerned that Regalado dared run as a single mother in her 30s raising two young children, she said. “I got a lot of pushback from people who thought I looked too young,” Regalado said. “And then I looked around and I realized, yeah, pretty much all the women who were elected had waited until their kids had grown up.” But Regalado, whose father, Tomás Regalado, served as the mayor of Miami during his daughter’s 2010 and 2016 runs, kept pushing. As the country seriously contemplated the possibility of its first female president in 2016, Regalado tried to make history in Miami-Dade County, which has never had a female mayor represent its 2.7 million residents. She ran against incumbent Mayor Carlos Gimenez and lost by 12 points.
Regalado’s loss ushered in another four years in Miami-Dade County under male mayoral leadership, the mark of a county that despite being the seventh most populous in the country tends to lack female representation. Of its 34 municipalities, only eight mayors are women. And the county’s biggest city, Miami, is run by a male mayor and an all-male commission.
While Regalado opted to run for the District 7 county commission seat rather than repeat a run for mayor in 2020, three other women — political newcomers Monique Nicole Barley and Ludmilla Domond and District 8 Commissioner Daniella Levine Cava — are vying for what would be a historic victory. And if one of them takes the office, they could be joined by a female-majority commission. There are commission seats up for grabs in all odd-numbered districts, with women on the ballot in four of the seven races. If women win all four races with viable female candidates, that would bring the commission to six men and six women. A woman would also have to take the District 8 seat vacated by Levine Cava either by appointment or a runoff election to capture a 7-6 majority, one currently reversed in favor of the men. The potential of a historic election for women in the county could spotlight a localized version of the success female candidates found in 2018, declared the second “Year of the Woman” as the number of women both running for and winning political offices skyrocketed. Over 100 women took congressional and governor’s seats in 2018, outpacing 1992’s “Year of the Woman,” which saw 54 women elected to Congress. Some candidates say the campaign field isn’t always equal playing ground, with additional challenges for female candidates and especially women of color. But they argue that even if having more female representation doesn’t automatically solve systemic issues, it isn’t merely symbolic, either. Both candidates and current commissioners said having women on board means issues like paid family leave and the gender pay disparity in the workplace are not just discussed, but prioritized, which is why female leadership should matter to voters. While women have been unable to secure the county’s mayoral seat thus far, they have managed to impact other major offices. For example, Katherine Fernandez Rundle, the first Cuban-American State Attorney in both the county and state, is serving her seventh term in her elected position. Several women have been elected to Congress. And the late Gwen Margolis, a longtime state legislator, was the first woman to serve as the president of the Florida Senate.
The Aug. 18 primary, where voters can cast their first vote in the nonpartisan race for mayor, falls on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The amendment granted some women, but not all, the right to vote. The anniversary highlights the significance of the potential history to be made in Miami-Dade County. And that history-making moment is “long overdue,” said Paul George, resident historian at the HistoryMiami museum. “I think we’re behind a lot of places,” George said. “There’s been an incredible dearth of women in leading government positions in this community.” Additional roadblocks for woman candidates Some of the candidates attribute that “dearth” to additional challenges women sometimes face when running campaigns, especially countywide. Even the candidates who say they haven’t experienced explicit differences or discrimination while campaigning acknowledge they likely have to work harder than their male opponents. Regalado said that instead of being asked about the issues, people wanted to talk about the length of her hair or her kids. She added that negative campaigning can hold women back. She said that she had to “rebuild her life” after her 2016 run. “It’s the negative campaigns that stop them, because of the idea of their children Googling their name and finding a blog or something,” Regalado said. Levine Cava, who is leaving her commission seat early to pursue a mayoral bid, is outraising all of her opponents except former Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas. Her campaign alone raked in nearly $800,000 in monetary contributions as of July 10, according to county filings. Despite her apparent popularity, Levine Cava said while running for her commission seat, she saw how qualities often attributed to women weakened her position in some voters’ eyes.
“I got feedback that the men were basically arrogant and cocky and that I was more soft and humble. And that this was perceived as my being insecure, which I just find you know, very upsetting,” she said. “Because you know, it’s like being open and listening and humble and respectful should not be perceived as weakness. It should be perceived as strength.”
In February, Levine Cava released an ad stating that Miami-Dade will “shatter our highest glass ceiling and make history” in November. Cindy Lerner, who is running against Regalado for the District 7 seat and has served in the state Legislature and as mayor of Pinecrest, said she never felt demeaned as a female public servant. But she also knows the work wasn’t equal. “For women to succeed, they have to work 10 times harder at the same thing. Luckily, this is not difficult,” Lerner said. District 3 Commissioner and Commission Chairwoman Audrey Edmonson echoed Lerner, saying even though she doesn’t feel looked down upon by the male commissioners, she knows that she works harder than her white or male colleagues as an African-American woman. And the challenges of being not just a woman but a woman of color in a countywide race is one felt by some of the current candidates, like Domond. “Before I’m even considered as a woman, I’m looked at as a color first,” said Domond, who is a Black woman and Haitian immigrant. “I think this would be just the beginning ... for people to see that no matter how diverse, ethnicity wise, Miami-Dade is, there’s still a whole lot of hindrances.”
In Miami-Dade County, 79% of the residents are white and nearly 70% identify as Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Additionally, nearly 18% of the population is Black. Domond said if she thought about the challenges of running as a Black woman before launching her bid, she may have never joined the race. And Monica Skoko Rodríguez, director of the Commission for Women, said Hispanic women can also have trouble talking themselves into running because “communities like us” can have certain cultural lenses that “may be holding women back in some ways.” “I’m a Latinx woman and I grew up around a lot of machismo and these ideas of cultural roles of men and women,” Skoko Rodríguez said. “I didn’t think that women belonged in politics until later in life.” But for some candidates, even if their being a woman is a factor for voters, it isn’t for them personally or their campaigns. District 5 Commissioner Eileen Higgins is hoping to defend her seat against two male challengers. She said that while the thought of a female-majority commission is exciting, when it comes to her running as a woman, she “literally never thinks about it.”
“It makes me uncomfortable talking about myself as a female candidate,” Higgins said. She added that as an engineer, she’s used to being the only woman in male-dominated spaces. Championing ‘women’s issues’ While not all of the female candidates shared experiences with discrimination while running campaigns, they did all agree on one thing: Women lead differently. And sometimes, differently can mean better, because women often invest in issues men are less likely to prioritize. Skoko Rodríguez said women are more likely to champion issues like paid leave and domestic abuse education, even though they are issues she said all elected officials should be concerned about. “I love to see so many women potentially in office but I think I want everybody to remember that male politicians also have to fight these fights for ‘women’s issues,’ just as fiercely as women politicians,” Skoko Rodríguez said. Higgins said that some issues just don’t occur to her male colleagues, such as digging into pay disparities for women in the county, “because they haven’t spent a chunk of their career being underpaid and undervalued.” “When we have a mix of men and women on the commission, we have a broader variety of legislation that benefits the community,” Higgins said. Higgins added that women don’t just change the content of the conversation, but how it’s had. “Gender matters. You look at what happens on the City of Miami Commission, where they scream and they yell and they do all that,” Higgins said. “They need some gender diversity.” Gepsie Metellus, who is running for the commission seat in District 3, said women, and particularly immigrant women, are “hypersensitive” to the needs of all. She said as cries ring out demanding that leaders address structural and institutional racism, anti-blackness and other “evils,” it’s women who respond.
“I think women hear these cries, women understand these cries, and women are prepared, are poised to respond to these cries,” Metellus said. Metellus said women are more likely to care about issues related to children and families, an opinion echoed by many of the other candidates, because women tend to pay attention to the “most vulnerable.” Levine Cava said she thinks the open-mindedness women bring to government would have benefited the county’s COVID-19 response. “I think it’s been very well documented that the countries or the places where the women are in charge have done better because of the women’s more inclusive, open listening, respectful manner in solving problems,” Levine Cava said. Regalado said women are better at coming to a consensus and long-term planning, both things that would have changed the coronavirus response.
But Regalado also credits the crisis created by the virus, which has made some residents hyper aware of the influence of local officials as they scrambled to figure out which rules and bans applied to them during shutdowns and reopenings, with bringing more women into the political fold. The impact of making history In addition to the way female voices change the conversations within government chambers, the candidates also see the symbolic value in centering female elected officials. “To have the first woman mayor, or even the first Black woman mayor, it would mean to me more like freedom,” mayoral candidate Domond said. “Freedom to say that the shackles that Miami-Dade County has been under, and these are psychological shackles, would have begun to be broken.” For Levine Cava, she can see the influence of her run personally on her toddler granddaughter, who she said will say “I’m just like my nonna” when walking around in binocular glasses. “We know that people are influenced by role models and when girls see women taking on the range of roles in society, it normalizes it. And it makes it something more attainable,” Levine Cava said. “She’s going to grow up with the understanding that the person who loves her and pays attention to her needs, her grandmother, is also someone people vote for.” Despite the chance to make history, some are cautious of the idea that the “year of the woman” alone can solve systemic problems down the line. “Women in office is such a triumph towards gender equality, but it is a puzzle piece, not a panacea,” Skoko Rodríguez said. “Racism isn’t going to be solved with more Black and brown politicians the same way that misogyny isn’t going to be cured with more women in power.” But when they can run, they should run — because men certainly do, said District 7 candidate Lerner. “I think the one thing I’ve seen about women … for the most part, they didn’t have the self-confidence, some would say courage, to put themselves out there and run. And men, they will just wake up one morning, whether they have credentials or not, and say I’m running,” Lerner said. “If you have an inner drive, then honor your gut. Honor that inner drive and take a chance.”
Higgins also called for women to take the risk of running. “We have to step up as women, don’t forget that. If we don’t step up to run, we’re not viable to be voted for,” Higgins said. In 2018, female candidates came out on top in local and statewide races across the country. The Miami-Dade County women running for office want to see if they can replicate that historic victory in primary elections on Aug. 18 and the general election on Nov. 3. “It’s about time. It’s about time to see this moment and blaze some trails for the generation of women who will come behind us,” Metellus said. “I do believe that it’s a fact. It’s the year of the woman.”"

When will we get COVID-19 vaccine? Fauci ‘cautiously optimistic’ about this timeline
By Summer Lin

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, testified before a House subcommittee on Friday, saying he was “cautiously optimistic” that we could have a vaccine by late fall or early winter. “We hope at the time we get into the late fall and early winter, we will have in fact a vaccine that we can say will be safe and effective. One can never guarantee the safety and effectiveness unless you do the trial but we are cautiously optimistic,” Fauci said. Biotech company Moderna launched a Phase III trial for its COVID-19 vaccine on July 21 and is planning to enroll 30,000 volunteers without coronavirus. Fauci told CNN that the volunteers will be a “diverse group” and “representative of our society and for those at risk.” Nineteen or 20 percent of the participants are African American and around the same percentage are Latinx, Fauci said. “You want representation in the trial of those who are most at risk for adverse consequences of getting infected,” Fauci said.
What about other potential coronavirus vaccines? There are more than 165 coronavirus vaccines being worked on around the world and 27 are in human trials, The New York Times reported. Pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer and German company BioNTech announced on July 27 that their COVID-19 vaccine was entering Phase II/III trial with 30,000 participants. The trial will take place in the U.S. and countries including Germany, Argentina, and Brazil. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have developed a COVID-19 vaccine and are currently in Phase II/Phase III trials in England and Phase III trials in Brazil and South Africa, according to The New York Times. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed seeks to have 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021.
So far, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has given $483 million in support to Moderna’s vaccine and up to $1.2 billion for AstraZeneca’s vaccine. More than 4.4 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed and more than 152,000 people have died from the virus in the U.S. as of July 31, according to Johns Hopkins University."

Does ‘Kindergarten Cop’ glorify police in schools? Complaints ax Oregon screening
By Don Sweeney

An Oregon film center has canceled plans for an outdoor screening of “Kindergarten Cop” after complaints the movie promotes over-policing in schools. The Northwest Film Center in Portland had planned to kick off its summer drive-in series Thursday, Aug. 6, with a showing of the 1990 comedy starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Willamette Week reported. The film depicts Schwarzenegger as a hardened police detective who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to catch a drug kingpin whose son is in his class in Astoria, Oregon. “National reckoning on overpolicing is a weird time to revive ‘Kindergarten Cop,’ ” wrote Portland author Lois Leveen on Twitter, Deadline reported. Her Twitter feed has since been made private. “There’s nothing entertaining about the presence of police in schools, which feeds the ‘school-to-prison’ pipeline in which African American, Latinx and other kids of color are criminalized rather than educate,” wrote Leveen, according to Deadline.
Some school districts and cities across the United States have been re-assessing or ending programs with on-campus police officers in the wake of protests over police brutality and the death of George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. “It’s true ‘Kindergarten Cop’ is only a movie. So are ‘Birth of a Nation’ and ‘Gone With the Wind,’ but we recognize films like those are not ‘good family fun,’” Leveen wrote in a follow-up email, Willamette Week reported. The center says complaints by Leveen and others prompted it to cancel “Kindergarten Cop” and instead schedule a second showing of a documentary on Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights figure who died July 17, according to the publication. The center had originally scheduled “Kindergarten Cop” because it was filmed in Oregon, MovieWeb reported. In the film, Schwarzenegger’s narcotics detective eventually gives up his badge to become a full-time kindergarten teacher."

To reach Hispanic voters in Florida, presidential campaigns turn to Bad Bunny
By Bianca Padró Ocasio

In the fight for Hispanic votes in Florida, the latest weapon is Puerto_Rican trap singer Bad Bunny. Both presidential campaigns are making a play for Hispanic voters in Florida — and also in Arizona — by launching dueling videos featuring the Puerto_Rican rapper’s music. Florida is home to over a million Puerto_Ricans, many of whom live in Central Florida, and make up nearly a third of eligible Hispanic voters living in the state. The musical outreach effort comes as polls in the battleground states show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump slightly shrinking. The Democrats went first, launching a 30-second digital ad last week featuring Bad Bunny’s slow break-up song called “Pero Ya No,” or “But not anymore.” And it came with a hashtag, #RompeConTrump, or #BreakupwithTrump, to drive home the idea that Trump just isn’t doing it for Hispanic voters anymore. It’s racked up over 280,000 views on YouTube. The Republican response came Monday: a video using a Bad Bunny lyric from a different song that goes, “Hello, who am I?” as a way to troll the Democrats’ ad and depict Trump’s opponent as senile and forgetful.
The videos, political consultants say, are an attempt to show how well the campaigns understand their own Hispanic supporters in swing states with large Latino populations. They’re a way of demonstrating cultural literacy while trying to turn an earworm in the brain into a vote at the ballot box. NEW: Two new Spanish Language Ads ft. Bad Bunny and Alejandro Fernandez + a Univision homepage takeover #RompeConTrump! ""Decepciones"" and ""Pero Ya No"" highlight a series of images spanning four years of Trump’s failed leadership. pic.twitter.com/MCefkRbIFu — Jennifer Molina (@JenMolina_v) August 28, 2020 “I think the content of the videos are almost secondary to the fact that the whole thing in this kind of environment is to get people’s attention,” said Carlos Odio, co-founder of the Latino-focused research firm EquisLabs and a former Obama administration White House aide. “You’re reaching... people you’d otherwise not be reaching it and it shows that you’re getting it.” The Biden ad, part of a $26 million TV and digital investment in Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania, features images of Trump supporters cheering in bleachers and then switches to footage of empty stadium seats. It folds in video of immigrant children sitting in fenced-in cages and the well-known scene that angered many on the island of the president tossing paper towels into a crowd at a Puerto_Rico church after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The Trump response ad is a short clip featuring a different Bad Bunny song titled “RLNDT,” which is based on the tale of a missing child case in Puerto_Rico, a boy named Rolandito who disappeared in 1999 and was never found. The song is about the singer’s worry that he lost his purpose in his quick rise to fame. In the ad, the chorus runs over a compilation of footage of Biden scratching his forehead and looking confused.
Bad Bunny — his full name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — has become something of a cultural marker in popular U.S. music, breaking cultural and gender norms in his songs and videos. His Spanish-language songs cross language barriers, too, consistently topping English-language charts with popular international hits like “I Like it Like That,” “Mia,” and “Yo Perreo Sola.” And this isn’t the first time the 26-year-old has delved into the world of politics. He was one of several high-profile artists who called for the resignation of former Puerto_Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in the summer of 2019. He recently made a publicized trip to the elections commission in Puerto_Rico, where he lives, to obtain his voter ID card. And over the weekend, he released a single called “Compositor del Año,” a freestyle rap in which he supports the Black Lives Matter movement and insults Trump. The Biden campaign confirmed they sought permission to use the song directly from Bad Bunny’s legal team. The Trump campaign declined to comment. “Bad Bunny is an undeniably influential figure for Latinos,” said Joel Maysonet, who works as director of Latino paid media for the Biden campaign. “He’s outspoken, recently with many issues that matter with Latinos, the LGBTQ community and so forth... It’s something that we thought that it would resonate.” The Biden campaign also released another ad aimed at Hispanic voters called “Decepciones” — or Disappointments — featuring the song by the same name from the Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández. It focuses on COVID-19 and immigrant children being separated from their parents, as Trump speaks in the background about building a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico. “You want people to pay a lot of attention… and [the Biden ad] is something to get excited about. So there’s like, a value from the perspective of the political class,” Odio said.
While Trump won Florida in 2016 by about a 1% margin, Hillary Clinton took Miami-Dade County with 63% of the vote and tied in heavily Cuban American areas like Hialeah. And while polls for the 2020 race have shown Trump is deeply unpopular among Puerto_Ricans, when it comes to turnout, Puerto_Ricans generally trail far behind Cuban Americans. Bad Bunny cut an ad for Joe Biden. It's not what we expected. This version is much better. pic.twitter.com/SWLUameQBf — Equipo Trump - Text VAMOS to 88022 (@EquipoTrump) August 31, 2020 On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said he believes Trump will hold Florida and is continuing to build support among Hispanics, even as some progressive and anti-Trump groups have recently beefed up their Spanish-language outreach. Through Equipo Trump and the Latinos for Trump coalition, the Trump campaign is pushing out ads that seek to paint Democrats as unfamiliar with Latinos and cast Biden as a far-left socialist. The campaign also recently put out radio ads with voiceovers that match the accent and slang of different Spanish-speaking counties. Mercedes Schlapp, senior adviser for the Trump campaign who is Cuban American, characterized the Biden Bad Bunny ads as evidence that “Democrats are culturally incompatible with Hispanics.” She pointed to the use of the gender-neutral term “Latinx,” which several polls have shown a majority of Latinos do not use. She called Biden “papa sin sal,” which translates to a potato without salt, or bland, and said Democrats just don’t understand Hispanics. “Our cultures are rich and lively. The Democrats want to make us feel like we’re victims, but Hispanics are winners. In short, the Democrats’ problems with Hispanics run much deeper than, and will outlive, Joe Biden’s culturally incompetent campaign.”
And while both campaigns are using Bad Bunny music as a way of reaching Hispanic voters, neither has released a full plan on Puerto_Rico. Earlier this summer, the Biden campaign was also being accused by over 90 field organizers of not doing enough to reach out to Puerto_Rican voters living in Central Florida, many of whom resent Trump’s response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. For Maysonet, who is Puerto_Rican and grew up on the island, the Bad Bunny ads are a way to show that Biden’s campaign appeals to all kinds of people. “Ever since I joined the campaign, it’s been my mission to run a program that reflects the diversity of the community. That it feels authentic,” he said. “This is not a translated message. It comes from the source.”"

Are young Latinos the key to a ‘new’ American economy? These leaders say yes
By Rene Rodriguez

Sol Trujillo remembers the signs that adorned the entrances of buildings when he was growing up in his hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming, in the 1950s. “The signs said ‘No dogs, cats, Mexicans or N------,’ ” Trujillo said. “My father used to tell me not to pay attention, because we were of Spanish descent. My family has lived in this country for 500 years, starting when the Spanish colonized Santa Fe, New Mexico. My parents married young and moved to Wyoming after the war to work for the Union Pacific Railroad. So even though there weren’t many Latinos in Wyoming, we grew up as a very proud family.” Things have changed a lot since then. Today, Trujillo, 68, is the first U.S.-born Hispanic CEO of a Fortune 200 company — U.S. West, now part of AT&T. Previously he held the top spot at the Australian telecommunication giant Telstra and the France-based digital service provider Orange SA, and has served on the boards of Target, Bank of America, Western Union and Pepsi. He also served as a trade policy adviser for the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.
Now Trujillo — who earned his master’s degree at the University of Wyoming in one year while holding down three jobs — wants to share his experience and advice with the world. L’ATTITUDE, the third edition of the national business conference Trujillo co-founded with Gary Acosta, the CEO of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP), will be held Sept. 24-27 in San Diego. The conference brings an A-list roster of CEOs and leaders from diverse fields — banking, financing, education, entertainment, tourism and technology — to exchange ideas and discussions on the best way to attract and serve the burgeoning young Latino population born in the U.S. Going virtual Although the event is usually held in San Diego, this year’s conference will be entirely virtual. All panels and discussions will be broadcast live as well as recorded for on-demand sessions. Confirmed attendees include Dow Jones CEO Almar Latour, Walmart CEO and President John Furner, Black Rock CEO and President Larry Fink and Marriott International CEO and President Arne Sorenson. Singer/entrepreneurs Pitbull and Emilio Estefan will be repping Miami. This year’s theme: The New Mainstream Economy, a term Trujillo coined in 2017 to describe the growing contributions by U.S. Latinos as consumers, entrepreneurs and workers — valued at a whopping $8.3 trillion.
“To me, the main difference between 20th century and 21st century America can be defined by what I call ‘The Two Ds,’” Trujillo said. “The first D is digitization. I’ve been in the technology field and introduced digitization in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I’m truly a digital native and now, almost all Americans are now digital because everyone is using mobile devices and communicating. “The second D is the one people talk about a lot but not in an economic sense, and that is demographics,” he said. “America has tended to be defined by one demographic in particular, the Anglo-American. But their birth rate dropped dramatically with the Baby Boomer generation, and they are reaching 65 at the rate of 400,000 a month.
“At the same time, the native-born Latino cohort, which is about two-thirds of the overall Latino demographic in the U.S., has an average of 19. We’re going to be looking for growth from this cohort for the next three decades.” According to the 2019 U.S. Latino GDP Project prepared by the Latino Donor Collaborative, if the U.S. Latino GDP were considered an independent economy, it would rank as the eighth largest in the world, ahead of Brazil and Russia. It is also growing 28% faster than the broader American economy, according to the report.
The L’ATTITUDE conference will focus on how companies can reach and harness that lucrative demographic. But the conference will also highlight the importance of employing those U.S.-born Latinos, as well as managing wealth, Latina entrepreneurship and the housing market. “Nike is a very inclusive brand and sport is a very inclusive and diverse phenomenon,” said John Donahoe, president and CEO of Nike, who will participate in a fireside chat during the conference. “We have to remain relevant to youth who set the culture. LatinX is one of the fastest growing segments in the population, and supporting them helps us to keep our brand fresh and vibrant and inclusive.” The Spider-Man factor The conference will also focus on the importance of hiring U.S. Latinos in positions of power, because they are the best way to reach that sought-after demographic. For example, the Cuban-American Miami native Phil Lord, who co-directed the Oscar-winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with Chris Miller, intentionally left snippets of Spanish dialogue in the movie without subtitles because he grew up in a bilingual household in a bilingual city, and the real world does not use subtitles. “We need to produce product that will attract audiences and do business and increase our penetration of the market,” said Tony Vinciquerra, CEO of Sony Pictures, which distributed the film. “The way to do that is to have people who are writing the scripts and working in front of and behind the camera who are representative of the marketplace.”
Another fireside chat with musicians Emilio Estefan and Pitbull will delve into their musical careers as well as their multiple business endeavors in fields other than recording. “There are a lot of people in music that have restaurants and a business company,” Estefan said. “L’ATTITUDE is a tribute to the American dream. It’s to show the world how lucky we are that we are part of the mainstream economy and also spread the right information about immigrants. I’ve done 28 movies. I worked on “Top Gun” and “Pocahontas” and “The Little Mermaid.” I did events in the White House for six presidents. I worked for three Olympics. People need to know that. The world is becoming more and more about diversity. We are blessed to have this opportunity.”"

Using your ‘indoor voice’ can reduce COVID spread. ‘Good luck with that in Miami’
By Linda Robertson

Listen, loud Miami talkers and habitual shouters. Shut up or quiet down and don’t be super spreaders of the coronavirus. Scientists have found that speaking softly cuts the exhaled spray of contaminated particles into the air and reduces the risk of transmission of highly contagious COVID-19 by 80 percent — and can even prevent infection as effectively as wearing a mask. In Miami, notorious for its noisy narrators, experts say turning down the volume could save lives. Talk as if you’re in a library: Add the habit to public health guidelines that include wash hands frequently, practice social distancing and wear a snug face covering, urge experts who have studied the pathways of microscopic disease-laden aerosols sucked into nostrils, throats and lungs. Simple in theory, but this is South Florida — Babel, U.S.A. “Good luck with that in Miami,” said Tony Moya as he departed Cafe Versailles with takeout coffee. “I’m guilty, I’m a loudmouth, I’m Cuban. It’s part of the culture here where 70 percent of the population is Latin, which makes it a city of loud people.”
Moya paused to talk, through his mask, about why it will be difficult in Miami to enforce scientists’ recommendation for more subdued communication. “Hispanic people are constantly trying to get our point across — we even get involved in conversations with complete strangers,” said Moya, a construction manager from Miami Beach who was born in Havana and grew up in Miami. “It’s in our nature to be passionate, while Anglos are more reserved and introverted. You walk into Versailles when it’s full, you can’t hear yourself think. The decibel level is higher than in a restaurant in Jacksonville or Oklahoma. To me, that’s normal.” Yolanda Valdes, standing in line at the Versailles ventanita, considers herself a keen observer of Miami. She was visiting from Union City, N.J., another Cuban enclave where her vociferous 86-year-old immigrant father is a dominoes champion. “I can compare: New York City is loud but not as loud as Union City and definitely not as loud as Miami,” Valdes said. “My parents raised me super Cuban. I’ve been in Manhattan restaurants and other customers will say, ‘Can you keep it low?’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, sorry. We’re not arguing, we’re just talking.’ My kids will tell me, ‘Mom, why are you screaming? Are you mad?’ No, no, I’m just talking.’ ”
Miguel Saavedra had lunch at Versailles, the Little Havana institution that has kept its character intact, pandemic or not, by hanging gaudy chandeliers over tables in the outdoor dining tent. Miami Cubans tend to be more animated, he said, because they appreciate what’s denied to people still living on the island. “Cubans in Cuba are in bad shape, miserable, hungry, oppressed, and then they come to the United States and they are so happy, so excited to be in a free country, they speak openly, with strong voices, muy alto,” said Saavedra, president of the Cuban exile organization Vigilia Mambisa. He’s known to lead frequent, vehement anti-Castro and now pro-Trump demonstrations punctuated by chanting — but he showed recent photos of his group, all wearing masks. “Personally, I’m suspicious of quiet people. They seem unfriendly,” said Saavedra, whose regular tone of voice is at bullhorn-level. “I think this Latin way of expression originated in Spain, where people converse at a high volume. You know they had horrible COVID outbreaks in Spain.”
The science is clear. If we all took a vow of silence, the pandemic that has sickened 31 million worldwide and killed 200,000 in the United States and more than 3,000 in one-time hot spot Miami might be snuffed out, said Jose-Luis Jimenez, a University of Colorado professor of chemistry and biochemistry who specializes in the dynamics of aerosols, clouds and pollutants. “If we were quiet, it would have a huge suppressant effect,” Jimenez said from his lab. “But coronavirus has already been so hard on our mental health and social lives. You tell someone to be quiet, they resent it and they respond to you in an even louder voice.” He created an Aerosol Transmission Estimator, a mathematical model that measures the risk of activities based on aerosol spread. For example, a person is 85 times more likely to get infected at an indoor gathering with pervasive talking than on a ventilated subway or bus ride. A study published last month in the British Medical Journal found that 6 feet of separation is not enough to dissipate expulsions of tiny droplets, called aerosols, that form moist clouds able to travel 20-25 feet and remain airborne for hours. “You’re breathing out 10 times more virus when you’re talking, 30 times more when you’re speaking loudly, 50 times more if you’re yelling or singing,” Jimenez said. “A COVID-19 carrier who remains silent could reduce transmission by 98 percent.” So you’ve heard the gasbag spouting his or her life story on their cellphones at the park or grocery store. Your tranquil beach visit has been interrupted by groups braying over the din of music they assume the public wants to hear. Now, you can shush-shame them: “Shhh. You’re making me sick.” Miami’s vocal exuberance could be problematic as the phased reopenings of indoor spaces accelerate. Gov. Ron DeSantis allowed bars to reopen in Florida, but Mayor Carlos Gimenez has not given the green light for Miami-Dade County, although he’s wavering. Bars are among the worst places to go if you want to avoid spreading or catching COVID-19, say scientists who have studied outbreak epicenters.
“For every large droplet you see, 100 to 1,000 times more invisible aerosols are being expelled from someone speaking loudly,” said Linsey Marr, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech. “We shouldn’t open any indoor dining places, bars or nightclubs. I refuse to go until the pandemic is over. People aren’t wearing masks because they’re eating and drinking; everyone is talking at close range, often over loud music; it’s crowded; they are staying for an hour or more, and they don’t know about the ventilation quality. All the prime ingredients make it a contagious environment.” Using his Estimator, Jimenez said theaters could be safer entertainment venues than a club, bar or restaurant where patrons speak loudly — although in Miami rude yappers are commonplace at movies and plays. He suggests turning down music, turning up air conditioning, opening windows — and never stand behind a person wearing an ill-fitting mask. Outdoors lifestyle may help Miami has one asset that could offset its noisy speech patterns: A subtropical climate. Contact tracing studies show that being outdoors is 20 times safer than being indoors. More air means a higher chance that aerosols will be dispersed or diluted before they’re inhaled. “Maybe you could open bars on the beach in Miami,” Jimenez said. “It’s really not looking good for fall and winter and flu season. Miamians should take advantage of their weather and do as many activities as possible outside — drinking, dining, exercising, going to school.” If Miami wants to steer clear of another surge, and another shutdown, Miamians should follow the risk reduction strategy of being softspoken. Businesses should put up signs: “Whispering works wonders.”
Can they comply? Yes, they can, said sociologist Lisandro Perez, an expert on Latin culture. Inconsiderate behavior crosses all borders “and there’s no empirical evidence to support the stereotype that you talk louder if you’re Hispanic,” he said. “The complete disregard for a sense of privacy is what annoys me. You’re at a nice restaurant and this couple is broadcasting the most intimate aspects of their lives,” said Perez, professor of Latin American and Latinx studies at John Jay College at the City University of New York. He was born in Cuba, founded FIU’s Cuban Research Institute and splits his time between Miami and Brooklyn. Coronavirus has forced oblivious people to become hyper aware of how they invade personal space physically and sonically, Perez said. “If you were too self-absorbed to care before, now you’ve been educated about social distancing,” Perez said. “Loud talking has always had a negative connotation, with social class dimensions. In Cuban films and TV programs, the loud talkers are uncouth, untrustworthy, the bad guys, the ones who left the island.”
Think of cigarette smoke Think about how exhaled cigarette smoke swirls and lingers if you want to protect yourself, Jimenez said. “One just has to imagine that others they encounter are all smoking, and the goal is to breathe as little smoke as possible,” he said of the analogy he uses to explain aerosols. “Inhaling a little whiff of ‘smoke’ here and there is OK, but a lot of ‘smoke’ for a sustained period of time and without a mask is risky.”
Think about smoke-filled rooms in old movies, like Rick’s Cafe in “Casablanca,” and you can position yourself in — or avoid — a place like the Taurus, a historic watering hole in Coconut Grove where on a recent Sunday boisterous conversations could be heard from the street. Customers at three patio tables engaged in a trifecta of transmission: They spoke ridiculously loudly in close proximity, did not wear masks and exchanged hugs and cheek kisses.
Jimenez and Marr were among 239 scientists from 32 countries who wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies demanding more recognition of research and warnings to the public about aerosol spread. “We think the aerosol pathway is the main route,” compared to transmission from contaminated objects or visible droplets from coughing and sneezing, Jimenez said. The CDC, however, reversed itself last week and edited out the new reference to aerosol risks on its website, saying the guideline was posted in error.
Aerosol transmission explains how many super spreader events occurred, including at a Guangzhou, China, restaurant where tables were far apart but air circulation was poor; a 2 1/2-hour choir rehearsal in Skagit County, Washington, where 53 of 61 singers got infected by one person, and two died; a karaoke party in Japan; a call center in South Korea; cramped, noisy, cold, poorly-ventilated meat-packing plants; a cruise ship and hospitals and nursing homes. There is one other challenge for multilingual Miami. Often, people aren’t speaking the same language. What do they do to overcome this failure to communicate? They talk louder and louder, as if somehow that will make them understood. Last week at the Home Depot on Southwest Eighth Street, a customer who didn’t speak English tried to get help from a clerk who didn’t speak Spanish. They obliterated the 6 feet of separation between them and gesticulated forcefully until they were arguing over the background beeping of a forklift.
Miami’s language barriers are a “big problem” and another reason the volume of speech can be unnerving, agreed Omar Martinez, talking in muy alto tones on the phone to the Social Security Administration about a missing check while he ate lunch at La Esquina de La Fama on Calle Ocho. “I am almost deaf in one ear because I served in the Cuban military during the war in Angola,” Martinez said, waiting to be connected with a Spanish-speaking rep. “Ay, finalmente!” he shouted into the phone. “Dígame, papi.”"

Can TV shows influence how we view immigration in the US? A new study takes a look
By Brooke Wolford

Immigration remains a hot-button issue/ in the United States andmany television shows feature storylines that illustrate the experiences of immigrants in America — whether accurate or not. How immigrants are depicted on TV shows — and how Americans’ perceptions and attitudes toward immigration are influenced — is the subject of a new report from Define American in conjunction with the University of Southern California’s Norman Lear Center. How immigrants are portrayed on TV The organization’s content analysis examined 129 immigrant characters in 59 television shows airing between 2018 and 2019, the “Change the Narrative, Change the World” report says. The study also surveyed 940 adults in the U.S. who at least occasionally watched “Madam Secretary,” “Orange is the New Black” or “Superstore” — shows that feature “prominent immigration storylines,” according to the report. The content analysis revealed most immigrant characters were men (57%), “judged to be Latinx,” and non-English speakers or bilingual (56%), the report says.
Some of the trends were not consistent with reality, according to the report. Immigrants over the age of 65 were underrepresented, as were Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants. Middle Eastern immigrants were over-represented. Another inconsistent trend with “real-world numbers” was the amount of characters who were “associated with a crime,” (22%). The report notes that this was “a major drop from the 34% of TV immigrant characters associated with a crime in 2018.” The number of undocumented or asylum-seeking immigrants portrayed in the shows was greatly over exaggerated (63%), according to the report. How often an immigrant character appeared in a show’s episodes influenced the character‘s portrayals. Characters in episodes with immigrant storylines were more likely to be Latinx (61%) or Middle Eastern (14%), come from Latin American countries (59%), be undocumented (62%), be currently incarcerated (20%) or “be held in a detention facility (34%) or involved in the immigration court system (8%).”
Characters who regularly appeared in a show’s episodes “were more likely to be white (31%) or Asian/Pacific Islanders (18%), come from Europe (21%) or be naturalized citizens/permanent residents (45%).” Audience perceptions The three shows used in Define American’s survey had “prominent immigration storylines.” Overall, the survey participants who were exposed to at least one of the shows “had more inclusive attitudes toward immigrants,” the study says. The more a viewer watched, the more they took “immigration-related actions” — which is not defined in the study. Viewers who identified as conservative or religious “were more likely to experience reactance — the feeling that the storyline was trying to manipulate them or take away their freedom,” the report said. “These feelings were associated with less inclusive immigration attitudes, knowledge about immigration, and immigration behaviors,” the survey found. “These findings suggest that immigration-related entertainment content may have limited impact on religious viewers. However, such content has the potential to decrease prejudice and support for criminalization policies among rural viewers.”"

‘Joe Biden has no ground game in Florida.’ Will Mike Bloomberg’s money change that?
By David Smiley

Progressive activists backing Joe Biden in Florida say they’ve made millions of phone calls, sent hundreds of thousands of text messages and even written thousands of letters to convince voters to support the Democratic presidential nominee. But one thing they’re largely not doing — and growing increasingly worried about — is talking to voters face-to-face. Now, with the number of coronavirus cases down from their July peak in Florida and Election Day less than six weeks away, the state’s largest left-leaning grassroots organizations and political field operations are making a last-minute push to get back in front of voters in a crucial battleground state where President Donald Trump’s campaign has been on the ground since June. “Joe Biden has no ground game in Florida,” Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and Trump campaign surrogate, said Wednesday on Fox News. “We have the best ground game in the country.” In order to address what they believe is a gap in the campaign behind Biden, a network of left-leaning political and issue advocacy organizations is turning to Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who pledged this month to spend $100 million in the state to help Biden win Florida on Nov. 3. Nearly two dozen organizations have pitched Bloomberg’s advisers on a unified get-out-the-vote plan revolving around person-to-person interaction. Many say they have yet to hear back. In the meantime, strategists say finding funding elsewhere has become difficult as smaller donors wait to see how Bloomberg will spend his money. But they clearly hope he’ll spend a large sum on fixing Biden’s in-person campaigning problem. “There’s a lot of anxiety among smart people who do this for a living and understand what it takes to win the state of Florida,” said a Democratic political strategist who asked not to be named for fear of irking Bloomberg’s team. “In an election where it’s close, that matters. [Trump’s campaign] is doing it and we’re not.” It’s unclear how much of the $100 million Bloomberg may dedicate to on-the-ground organizing in Florida, or how that money would be spent if allocated to field operations. A Bloomberg spokesperson on Wednesday would only say that some of his pledge will go toward get-out-the-vote efforts and, specifically, efforts to target mail voters. Part of the drive to get back in front of voters is related to the release this week of nearly 5 million domestic vote-by-mail ballots by Florida elections officials. Polls are also finding that Biden is struggling somewhat with Hispanic voters in the state, with some strategists saying they are best reached in person. Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has been holding in-person events for weeks — in the midst of the pandemic — as polls show the race tightening and the president’s standing in the state improving. Democrats have been slower to return to neighborhood canvassing and public events due in part to a bevy of information that shows that left-leaning voters are more inclined than Republicans to view COVID-19 as a significant threat. But operatives who spoke to the Miami Herald say there’s reason to believe in-person contact — done responsibly — would be an asset to a campaign that were it not for the coronavirus would have scores of people knocking on doors and handing out literature. “There’s really no replacement for the kind of energy and momentum political campaigns can get when they’re flanked by in-person voter contact and people in communities talking to their neighbors,” said Andrea Mercado, executive director of New Florida Majority, among the largest grassroots organizations in the state. Mercado’s organization is among a loose-knit group of 23 Florida-based non-profits, donors and political organizations seeking funding from Bloomberg. Sources familiar with the request say the progressive organizations have asked that Bloomberg kick in about $22 million — roughly two-thirds the price of a statewide voter contact plan that revolves around in-person canvassing. The concepts presented to Bloomberg have not been solely focused on in-person voter contact. Josh Weierbach, executive director of the progressive grassroots group Florida Watch, told the Miami Herald that they’re seeking to use the money to boost candidates in down-ballot races through online avenues. “Our focus is on digital organizing in state legislative races and we’re meeting people where they live, on their phones and computers,” said Weierbach. “Digital organizing plays a more significant role in every election but that has never been more true than it is today with campaigns being conducted in the midst of a pandemic.” Expectations are that Bloomberg will spend the bulk of his money on TV and digital ads. He has already announced at least $13 million in ad buys, including $8 million in Spanish-language ads. He also announced that he’d raised more than $16 million to help pay off the fines and fees of thousands of ex-felons seeking to restore their right to vote but unable to first pay off court-ordered costs. Eric Johnson, a Democratic consultant to U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, who is among Bloomberg’s inner circle in Florida, said the former New York mayor’s team is considering the entire campaign picture in the state. “They get that they need to target key communities. They’re doing a lot of focus on Latinx, Caribbean and African American communities,” he said. “It’s not just TV. It’s turnout. So they’re doing what needs to be done to make one of the absolute only must-win swing states for Trump extremely difficult for him.” But some consultants worry that Bloomberg is already short on time. Others fret that the former mayor, who spent $1 billion on a short-lived presidential campaign, has a spotty track record of making sound political investments despite a reputation as a data-driven decision maker. But regardless of how Bloomberg spends his money, or how much of it, Trump’s campaign says it will be too late. Danielle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for Trump Victory, the joint effort between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, said there’s not enough time for Biden’s supporters to catch up to a Republican field program that has been humming since 2016 and resumed in-person work three months ago. “Building a good data system, a ground game, infrastructure — that takes time,” she said. “You can’t parachute someone in six weeks before an election and expect to be where we are.”"

Walter Mercado ‘speaks’ to Hispanic voters in astral registration push 
By Bianca Padró Ocasio

No matter how the stars align themselves on November 3, the late Walter Mercado has the same horoscope for every sign under the Zodiac calendar leading up to the presidential election: You must register to vote. In a final (and astral) push to boost Latino voter registration, WhatsApp launched a digital ad campaign this week in partnership with Mercado’s family, in which the iconic Puerto_Rican astrologer asks people to register to vote ... con mucho, mucho amor. The deadline to register to vote in Florida is October 5. “Walter lived a life of love and unity,” his family said in a Facebook post Monday. “Now it’s your turn to make your vote count with Mucho, Mucho, Amor.” The social media platform is appealing to its large Latino user base with other planned content featuring Mercado, who died in November 2019. To help people register, the company is also partnering with vote.org’s voter resource bot, an automated registration tool that eligible voters can use on WhatsApp to register to vote, request a mail ballot, find nearby polls and know your rights as a voter.
“For many in the Latinx community, their voices are unheard and their future uncertain. Together, we can help members of this community realize their power to change the future of education, health care, economy and beyond,” vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey said in a statement. Mercado, who at his peak had a daily audience of about 120 million viewers, continues to be a ubiquitous presence among Latin Americans abroad and in the U.S. He solidified much of his fame in the U.S. through the program “Primer Impacto,” which aired in major Hispanic markets, including Miami. Earlier this year, Netflix aired a widely watched documentary of his life, “Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado,” titled after the famous phrase he used to close every segment — lots and lots of love. Though in his life he generally stuck to predictions and recommended New Year’s Eve rituals, he would also weigh in on current affairs in the U.S. and Latin America. In July 2016, Mercado predicted a Donald Trump presidency would bring “total destruction” of the world."

Florida’s TikTok generation is showing up at the polls this year. Will they be the difference?
By Mary Ellen Klas

A generation more familiar with TikTok, Instagram and XBox has the potential to make the difference in Florida’s toss-up presidential race between two seventy-somethings. Younger voters this year have been registering and casting ballots in bigger numbers than previous years and, if the presidential race in Florida is as close as polls predict, it will be decided by the margins. There about 1.1 million additional new Florida voters between 18 and 34 in 2020 than there were in 2016, according to state data provided to the political parties and reviewed by TargetSmart, a Democratic political data and analytics firm. New data says many of those voters are showing up to vote. According to an analysis by Catalist, a progressive polling organization that is monitoring Florida’s voting trends among a slightly broader age group, ages 18 to 39, turnout has increased 44% among those voters compared to 2016. “All signs point to this being a record turnout,’’ said Michael Frias, CEO of Catalist, referring to both young voters and the general population.
Young voters traditionally are the least likely group to vote. They don’t think politics affects their lives. They aren’t accustomed to navigating the hurdles to registering and voting. They are less established in the workforce compared to older Americans and their lower income levels and education gaps make them less inclined to get involved in the political process. And this year, the pandemic has scattered them, even from college campuses that have been magnets for political activity in election years. But Frias says he sees a shift in energy this year, and higher young voter turnout could make a difference in a tight race for president in Florida, or down the ballot in narrow matches for Congress, the state Legislature or local government races. “Young people with and without college degrees seem to be similarly animated to go vote,’’ he said.
Jessica Fernandez, president of the Florida Federation of Young Republicans, sees it. “The support for this president and his reelection is historic,” said Fernandez, 35, whose husband is president of the Miami Young Republicans. “I have never seen the level of enthusiasm since I have been working on campaigns since 2007.” Justin T. Atkins, 32, also sees it. He is state director of NextGen Florida, the left-leaning political committee created and funded by California billionaire and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer that is focused on the youth vote. “Young people are more galvanized this election than they’ve ever been,’’ Atkins said. The pandemic’s impact on the job market, rising student debt and the nation’s racial reckoning have led more young people “to find their voices and realize that the first step to rectify these issues is the ballot box.” The racial composition of young Floridians who are voting early also has shifted since 2016. Four years ago, 38.5% of the votes cast by young voters, with two weeks to go to the election, came from non-white young voters. This year, the percentage of non-white young voters ages 18-39 who had cast ballots was up to 54% as of Thursday, Frias said. More than three fourths of them are Democrats. South Florida has the largest contingent of young voters, with nearly 1 million registered voters age 18-35 in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The Tampa Bay area of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco counties is next highest with half a million young voters. Nationally, the Institute of Politics Harvard Youth poll shows that young voters across the country have a higher level of enthusiasm than they did four years ago. Younger Florida voters have followed the national and state trend and requested an unprecedented number of mail ballots this year — 800,000 in 2020, compared to 471,000 four years ago, according to an analysis of state data by TargetSmart. But historically many young voters do not return their ballots, or they make mistakes on them when they do. Victoria Reyes, 22, of Aventura understands how her generation underperforms. She was 18 in 2016 and did not vote because she was a Florida State University student studying abroad in Florence and struggled with getting a ballot.
Now, she runs canvassing operations for the Miami-Dade Democratic Party in two Miami-based House districts and is focused on making sure people don’t neglect their vote. “I have friends who in theory care, but don’t care enough to be invested in the news,’’ she said. She cites her twin brother as an example. “I make him vote. But he can’t name the Florida senators,’’ she said. “He literally is my twin brother. He lives with me and I do this every day and he absolutely could not care. He’s progressively apolitical.”
Democratic edge Who will these voters help the most? Of the 3.5 million voters age 18 to 35 in Florida, 1.3 million are Democrats, 1.2 million are registered with no party affiliation and 910,000 are Republicans. Two Florida-only polls released Oct. 20 show Biden with a narrow margin in Florida but with a comfortable lead among younger age groups. A University of North Florida poll had Florida voters ages 18-24 giving Biden a 29-point advantage and those ages 25-34 giving Biden a 23-point advantage. A CNN poll combined younger and middle-aged Florida voters, ages 18-49, and that gave Biden only a four-point advantage. But both Republicans and Democrats are claiming to have the edge among Florida’s younger voters. Since the beginning of the year, Fernandez of the Federation of Young Republicans and her team have worked to contact an estimated 1.7 million voters through phone calls, door knocking or text messages, she said. They have hosted 40 candidate forums and 20 media training events all aimed at getting people to the polls.
She points to Federico Arango, 30, a Miami musician and filmmaker, who is a registered Democrat but is voting for Trump — primarily because of the president’s support for establishing a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force. “All of us young voters that grew up watching Star Wars, Star Trek and sci-fi fantasy, we saw the Mars Rover land on Mars and we always dreamed what it would be like to have a greater presence in space that is not just exploratory,’’ Arango said Thursday, in between Trump-related campaign events in Miami. He doesn’t trust Biden to pursue the dream and is so enthusiastic about a Space Force that he and his brother have composed and produced an anthem for the organization, which is currently housed in the Air Force. Trump enthusiasm Fernandez said her organization has just under 600 members and the top priorities are the economy and getting people back to work. “In the last four years young people have been able to see big gains financially,’’ she said. Now, the pandemic has put many of their goals on hold. “The fear-mongering over the coronavirus really upset them,’’ she said. “Not that they wanted to risk the health of themselves or others but they felt there was a need for a middle ground.” Harvard’s IOP poll showed that while 60% of young voters say they support Biden, compared to 27% for Trump, the president’s supporters are more enthusiastic about voting for him than Biden supporters are in voting for the Democrat. “Young voters are not naive,’’ said Atkins of NextGen. “They know Joe Biden is not the most progressive candidate but what they are seeing is that he is going to the table with Bernie Sanders. He is going to the table with [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and they are seeing him talking about minimum wage, free public college, student debt and they see Joe Biden as more of a candidate they can hold accountable to listen to them.”
First time mistakes This will be the first presidential election for Florida’s youngest voters, more than 780,000 voters 18 to 22 years old, and research shows that young voters have a propensity to be slower to return mail ballots, and make more mistakes. Dan Smith, chair of the political science department at the University of Florida, has researched mail-in balloting in Florida and found that younger voters have their signatures missing or rejected or have their ballots come in late at three times the rate of other voters. “A lot of people don’t know what a stamp is,’’ said Atkins of NextGen Florida. And younger voters often have their signature change from the time they registered when they were 18, Smith said. “They are used to signing with their finger on a scratch pad at Publix, but they don’t realize they are using the signature you used when they registered to vote,’’ he said. NextGen has joined with America Votes and other groups to follow up on rejected ballots and receive daily reports from supervisors of elections, Atkins said. They attempt to reach voters, by phone or by text, and gauge whether they have been properly informed by the supervisors if their ballot was rejected and then walk them through the “curing” process to file an affidavit to have their vote count, said Abel Iraola, press secretary for NextGen Florida. NextGen, the NAACP and FPIRG also have mounted an aggressive effort to get young voters to vote early and have watched a steady increase in tracking polls that register how determined young voters are to vote. “We know that Florida is a 1% state,’’ Atkins said, referring to the state’s traditionally tight margins in elections. “Our goal is to really drive out a lot of those low turnout voters.”
Among their targets: keeping an estimated 600,000 active young voters across Florida engaged and reaching another 500,000 “low propensity” voters, particularly young Black and Latinx voters, he said. The organization has launched a $2.6 million digital ad campaign, with ads in English and Spanish running on platforms that young people use, such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Hulu and Vevo, specifically targeting young Latinx voters and young Black voters and takes credit for registering almost 22,000 new voters. Students from more than a dozen progressive groups have also organized an 11-day ground mobilization effort targeting turnout among young people and communities of color. The group includes dozens of advocacy organizations and will highlight early vote events around the country, including Miami. Both Republicans and Democrats say they want to capitalize on their midterm momentum by targeting close congressional and state legislative races. Atkins, of NextGen, said the group’s goal is get enough young voters to cast ballots to give Democrat U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcarsel-Powell an advantage over Republican Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez in the District 26 congressional race. They are also focused on the state senate races in Miami and Orlando and several close state House races, Atkins said. And Fernandez, of the Florida Young Republicans group, has hosted events aimed at boosting Republican candidates across the state. “We’re also advocating for all the Republicans up and down the ticket,’’ she said. “We have to have a deep bench.”"

Too many Florida police departments reluctant to protect Black voters at the polls
By Rhonda Thomas

As Florida embarks on its last week of early voting, voters of color are experiencing great anxiety — and for good reason. This year has been unlike any other we’ve experienced, from the senseless shootings of unarmed people of color to the president using his platform to stoke racial fears. That’s why, many of us were alarmed — but, sadly, not surprised — when police officer Daniel Ubeda showed up at a Government Center polling site in Miami with his badge, gun and face mask with the words with “Trump 2020” and “No more bull----.” Although the Miami Police Department provided a swift and strongly worded condemnation of the officer’s behavior, it does not provide much comfort to the thousands of Black, Latinx and young voters still heading to the polls and already rightly concerned about voter suppression and intimidation. We know Ubeda’s behavior is not an anomaly. There is a concerted effort by extremists to harass and depress voter turnout in Miami’s Black and brown communities. In fact, just as many of us were learning about Ubeda’s inappropriate behavior, we also learned that dozens of registered Democrats had received emails threatening them if they didn’t vote for President Trump. However, we refuse to let these scare tactics intimidate us and keep us from having our voices heard. This is the most important election of our lifetime, and we will continue to fight to have our right to vote protected. As a pastor, it is my responsibility to defend, protect and advocate for the rights of my community. My activism to expand voting rights isn’t separate from my ministry — it is birthed from it.
As part of this activism, my organization, Faith In Florida, initially reached out to police departments across the state to discuss how we can work together to protect voters from harassment and potential violence. Unfortunately, each time we tried to discuss concrete plans and next steps to keep voters safe, the officers would ignore our requests and instead vent their frustrations about the George Floyd case and the resulting protests. Despite our attempts to bring them back to discussing the matter of safety at the polls, it became apparent that the officers’ attention was elsewhere. In an ideal world, it would be clear to everyone that law enforcement has a duty to uphold its oath to protect and serve all Americans, regardless of their race, class or Zip code. Yet, this is not our reality. Still, we remain undeterred. History has also shown us that when law enforcement — and the state — have failed us, we as Black people still have ourselves, our communities and our institutions. It is in the spirit of, and respect for, this inherited legacy that Faith in Florida has been hosting “Souls to the Polls” events across the state that bring communities together with food, music and activities to mobilize them to vote. My faith and the history of those who have come before me have taught me that all people, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, have the right to exercise their right to vote without being harmed. And we have the right and ability to come together as a people and community to mobilize one another to vote.
Voting is a fundamental right and certainly isn’t one we will forfeit when everything is on the line. We may not have all of law enforcement on our side, but history, indisputably, is. Our future generations will look to us to right all the wrongs of the last four years, and we will continue to work tirelessly to do right by them."

Trump’s support in Miami Gardens was small — but double his numbers in 2016. Here’s why
By C. Isaiah Smalls II and Andres Viglucci 

Miami Gardens’ backing for Donald Trump on Election Day 2020 more than doubled from 2016, vote tallies from the majority-Black city’s precincts show — a surprising result that may reflect the Republican president’s broader inroads into minority voters’ traditional support for Democratic candidates. It was still a blowout for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who accounted for a little more than 84% of the Miami Gardens vote. That was a drop from Hillary Clinton’s 94% share in 2016, though. And while Democrats expected that Biden wouldn’t match Clinton’s results, Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert III said he was still shocked at the size of the bump his city’s voters gave Trump. “I’m always surprised of anyone who votes for Trump,” Gilbert quipped before pushing back on the assumption that Black voters are monolithic voters. “People vote for very different, independent reasons.” It’s not precisely clear why Trump’s support ballooned in Florida’s largest primarily Black city. But the numbers tell their own story: Trump got 7,601 votes this year versus 43,138 for Biden, compared to 3,328 for Trump and 42,548 for Clinton in 2016. Some experts point to Miami Gardens’ growing number of Hispanic residents, now some 26% of the city’s population, according to Census estimates. Voters in Miami-Dade’s Hispanic-majority precincts swung heavily to Trump this week.
Others mentioned Trump’s history of sowing disinformation targeted at Black Americans, while GOP leaders said the president’s message of economic opportunity for Black people and his record on criminal-justice reform attracted many Black voters. In reality, it was likely a combination of factors, said Olivia Jackson, a political science professor at Florida Memorial University in Miami Gardens. “Donald Trump did a great job lobbying for Black and Latinx votes in the final days of the campaign,” Jackson said. She added that Trump touting The First Step Act, the criminal justice reform legislation passed under his administration, coupled with his attacks on Biden’s key backing of a controversial 1994 crime bill likely resonated with Black men. “He was not expecting to get 90% of Black votes. We know that. But, strategically, it made sense if he could get a one- or two-percentage point increase [from 2016].” Miami Gardens’ voter registration numbers show a 14% increase from 2016, reflecting the city’s growth. Its Latino population saw the biggest jump in registration of 40%, to 14,929 voters.
But while Miami-Dade’s Hispanic population helped fuel Trump’s win in Florida, Miami Gardens’ Latinos account for only 20% of the city’s electorate. In another anomaly for Miami-Dade, the greatest number of Hispanic voters in the city are registered as Democrats, followed by those with no party affiliation. That suggests that the role of Hispanic voters in Trump’s Miami Gardens boost is, at best, only part of the story. The bigger part, suggested Sean Jackson, head of the Black Republican Caucus of Florida, was Trump’s success in persuading many Black voters, especially Black men, that the president has something real and tangible to offer them. Jackson cited low Black unemployment figures prior to the COVID pandemic, the creation of economic empowerment zones and growing disenchantment with Democratic “rhetoric” about race. It also helped that Trump was able to enlist high-profile support from some Black business leaders and celebrities like retired football star Herschel Walker and rappers Ice Cube and Lil Wayne., Jackson said. Trump “has shown Black people, and Black men in particular, that [he] is not only not a racist, but actually wants everybody to be inclusive of the American Dream — the opportunity to have a good-paying job and the opportunity for economic advancement,” Jackson said. On Trump’s message, Jackson added: “I know it’s resonating in Miami Gardens. When you go to Miami Gardens, you are bound to have Black men who want the very same things.” Jackson’s assertions appear to have proven true outside Miami Gardens as well. In Miami-Dade’s primarily Black precincts, Trump won a little more than 13% of the vote compared to roughly 7% in 2016. Nationally, preliminary exit polls show Trump’s support among Black voters increased four points to 12% in 2020, according to the New York Times. This shift to the right, albeit relatively small, should be of particular concern to Democrats, considering how much time the Biden campaign spent in Miami-Dade. Former President Barack Obama made two appearances in the 10 days leading up to the election. Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, spoke twice in Miami Gardens.
When asked if sexism possibly played a role in the shift, Gilbert rejected the idea entirely. “I think Kamala Harris was probably the most popular of the four people on the ticket in Miami Gardens,” he said. Like Gilbert, T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, also challenged the notion that Black voters uniformly vote for Democrats. He specifically took issue with the assumption that Black people can’t change their minds. “If white folks increased their vote in Miami Gardens, we would not be having this conversation,” Fair said. Fair then took it a step further, saying that Biden “has no respect for Black people” while chastising both his and President Barack Obama’s record on race. “Once history is written correctly, [Trump] did more for Black folks than Barack Obama ever thought about doing,” he said. Using Russia 2020 election interference as an example, Florida Memorial’s Jackson ultimately attributed Trump’s uptick in support in Black communities — both nationally and locally — as evidence that the president’s penchant for disinformation works. In the past month alone, Trump has falsely claimed Biden called Black youth “super predators” and that the Democratic presidential nominee would raise taxes, which is only true for people whose income exceeds $400,000. “Everybody doesn’t know how to distinguish fact from fiction,” she said."

If Miami-Dade goes more Republican, is Florida still a swing state? 
By David Smiley

In three statewide elections over the last four years, Miami-Dade County has voted as if it were three different places. In 2016, the county’s voters overwhelmingly rejected Donald Trump in numbers not seen by a top-of-ticket Republican since the 1990s.
Two years later, Republicans rebounded somewhat in Miami-Dade, with losses modest enough in the blue-leaning county to allow the GOP candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate to win narrowly. And on Nov. 3, Trump pulled off a stunning turnaround in the county, performing like Republicans from a previous era of Florida politics as he added Florida to his win column in what was, by modern standards, a blowout.
Now, as Democrats and Republicans begin to plan for the next set of elections — which will include governor, statewide cabinet positions and one of two U.S. Senate seats in Florida — political strategists and candidates want to know one thing: Which Miami-Dade County will show up on Nov. 8, 2022? Miami-Dade’s rightward shift in 2020 has already generated talk that the nation’s biggest swing state might be losing its swing. “For the moment, we’re a pink state, not a purple state,” said Eric Johnson, a Democratic consultant who has advised Florida’s only statewide elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nicole “Nikki” Fried. “Does that mean you give up? Of course not.” If the county’s 1.5 million voters vote more like they did in 2020 than they did in 2016, it would bode well for Republicans and poorly for Democrats, who need to run up the score in Democrat-heavy South Florida to compete in races statewide. Miami-Dade’s evolution over the last 15 years from a left-leaning but competitive county to a reliably blue region has coincided with Florida’s emerging reputation as a state where races for president, governor and Senate come down to 1 percentage point or less.
Back in 2000, when the presidential race went to a recount in Florida, Democrats did not enjoy an overwhelming advantage over Republicans in the county. But since then, as the number of voters in the state has nearly doubled, immigration and migration patterns have changed Florida’s demographics, and a growing community of Hispanic and Caribbean immigrants in South Florida has become something of a counter-balance on the left to a steady stream of conservative-minded Midwest retirees moving to Central Florida. Given that dynamic, any hint that Miami-Dade County has once again become more friendly to Republicans could ward off Democratic donors and give top-of-ticket candidates second thoughts. But elections and voter bases aren’t static. And neither party assumes that the coalition that came out for Trump this month will automatically come out for any other Republican candidate. “It’s all about the messaging and the candidate,” said Reggie Cardozo, deputy Florida state director for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, which lost the state to Trump despite a Miami-Dade County win of 290,000 votes. “Politics are a pendulum.” Similarly, Miami-Dade Democratic Party Chairman Steve Simeonidis said he expects Democrats to rebound from 2020, much in the way Republicans bounced back from their losses in the county four years ago. “The gains Republicans saw [this month] are similar to the gains we saw in 2016,” he said. “Politics are fluid situations and coalitions are going to vary.” Many Democrats also say that the coronavirus pandemic altered the 2020 election by forcing unprecedented changes in campaigning, and it’s unknown how future elections will change after the pandemic fades. They also hope a Joe Biden presidency will help beat back Republicans’ claims — which landed strongly in Miami-Dade — that Democrats want to usher in socialism to the United States.
But heading into 2022, Clinton’s results four years ago in Miami-Dade County — made possible by Trump’s poor standing among conservative Cuban Americans and independents — look more like an outlier than Trump’s 2020 numbers. And Republicans head into the next election under the belief that Trump’s 2020 voters in Miami-Dade, which were based around a surprisingly diverse coalition of Hispanic voters from around the Caribbean and Latin America, are theirs to lose. “If you look at the city of Hialeah, Trump went from winning the city by, like, 100 votes to getting 66% of the vote,” said state Sen. Manny Diaz Jr., a ubiquitous Trump surrogate in the heavily Cuban-American section of Northwest Miami-Dade. “That’s a growing movement, and it’s not going away.” Giancarlo Sopo, a Cuban-American communications strategist involved in Hispanic outreach for the Trump campaign, said no one can replicate Trump’s “unique blue-collar appeal.” But he said future Republican candidates can learn from a campaign that used non-traditional methods — like an October Trump interview with Spanish-language, Cuban-American social media influencer Alex Otaola — to communicate his message to voters outside the typical Republican base. “Nothing lasts forever in politics,” said Sopo, a former Miami-Dade Democrat who renounced his affiliation with the party several years ago as it shifted left. “To sustain these gains, we must continue engaging these new constituencies with the same kind of sophisticated messaging we demonstrated on the campaign and appealing to blue-collar values. Culture drives politics and the Democrats created a huge opportunity for conservatives with Hispanics by branding themselves as the party of socialism, ‘Latinx,’ and postalitas” — Spanish slang for phony. Trump’s top Florida strategist, Susie Wiles, reinforced that idea in a post-election memo provided to the press. Wiles wrote that the president’s results in his newly declared home state ought to signal that the GOP can and should be a “big tent” party — recycling a Reagan-era idea — as a way of holding onto much of the coalition that Trump built.
Trump would have won Florida this year even if he had repeated his 2016 performance in Miami-Dade County. But in an interview several days later on WPLG’s “This Week in South Florida,” Wiles said Florida’s demographics are changing in such a way that she believes the more traditional Republican coalition is no longer capable of electing GOP candidates in statewide elections. And she rejected the idea that Trump’s comfortable 2020 Florida win is a sign that the nation’s largest battleground had now become a red state. “It would be easy to think that,” she said. “But I frankly don’t.”"

Gluttony. Greed. ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ performed in live theater on Lincoln Road
By CHRISTINE DOLEN

Envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, wrath. Since ancient times, these vices have been known collectively as the seven deadly sins. Now, nine months into the country’s battle against COVID-19, Miami New Drama and its boundlessly imaginative artistic director, Michel Hausmann, have figured out a way to turn vice into virtue, exploring the seven deadly sins in an ambitious return to live theater running through Jan. 3. “During the summer, I’d walk up and down Lincoln Road, and I saw a lot of empty storefronts,” says Hausmann, whose company was about to open the world premiere musical, “A Wonderful World,” at its home in Miami Beach’s Colony Theatre when the pandemic forced March’s abrupt shutdown. “I thought the seven deadly sins could be a great organizing principle to talk about our country through those sins.” And he thought about those vacant storefronts, and about the fact that the often glorious South Florida weather in November, December and January would allow for theater to move outside the box of the Colony Theatre.
Play presented in Lincoln Road storefronts The result: “Seven Deadly Sins,” a collection of short plays, will be presented through Jan. 3 in six storefronts along the 1100 block of Lincoln Road, as well as at the Colony Theatre’s loading dock. For all of the effective ways arts groups have sustained themselves and their audiences with digital productions, Hausmann and managing director Nicholas Richberg have remained focused on how to return safely to live performances. “We knew we couldn’t be a company that just does Zoom plays,” Richberg says. “We produce theater, with humanity mixing in person.” Adds Hausmann: “We’re in the business of live storytelling. When you think of it through that prism, a huge freedom opens up.”
As a first step, Hausmann commissioned 10-minute plays from seven celebrated playwrights — men and three women, five of them Latinx writers and two Black — asking each to list a first-, second- and third-choice sin. Nilo Cruz, Dael Orlandersmith, Carmen Peláez, Moisés Kaufman, Hilary Bettis, Aurin Squire and Rogelio Martinez, most of whom have a history with Miami New Drama or Hausmann, all said yes to the project. What the company got back, says Richberg, is a group of “exciting, unexpected stories. They’re definitely not the obvious takes on the sins. And they all have the depth of full-length plays.” The plays are as eclectic as their authors. Nilo Cruz, the Cuban-American, Miami playwright whose Pulitzer Prize-winning “Anna in the Tropics” premiered at Coral Gables’ intimate New Theatre in 2002, got lust as his subject. His new play, “Amsterdam Latitudes,” features Caleb Scott as Miran, a lost soul in Amsterdam’s red light district, and Jessica Farr as Ludmila, the prostitute upon whom his attention is riveted.
“The moment Michel told me the design, I immediately [imagined] the brothels of Amsterdam. I saw an image,” Cruz says. “It would be in Amsterdam but with references to Miami, to water, to the fluidity of water and memory. … Just the physical wasn’t enough. It had to be emotional and spiritual too, to transcend the body.” Brothels of Amsterdam “Amsterdam Latitudes,” one of five plays Hausmann is directing, has already been a fulfilling experience for Cruz. “It’s exciting to work with actors again. … And this piece is so cinematic. We’re going to be like voyeurs watching them,” he says. “There’s a desire to go back to the theater, to be part of that ritual, to experience something together.” Scott and Farr feel that excitement. too. “It’s been so long since we’ve been able to be in a room working with our bodies vs. just our faces,” says Scott, referring to what he calls the “horror box” that is Zoom. “The limitations of intimacy feel very right at the moment … [yet] this is very heightened. There’s no slow build. It opens at the apex of Miran’s conflict. It feels very charged.” Adds Farr: “Nilo’s work is so poetic, elevated and challenging. … A common theme is peeling away the veneer of ghosts to get to the person in front of you. It’s beautifully lyrical.”
Another of the plays, “Blackfish,” is the work of Aurin Squire, a co-producer for the CBS series “Evil” and “The Good Fight,” who has several other plays and an Amazon project pending. The piece tackles sloth and will be performed by Sandi Stock, who plays Regina, a successful artist and professor of African-American culture. There’s more than a little of Rachel Dolezal, a white professor who famously pretended to be Black, in the character’s artistic DNA. “Michel mentioned this to me during the summer, and I thought of the history of plays during the plague,” says Squire, who grew up in Opa-locka. “Sloth actually means distance from God. It’s not a hard sin … but it supports all the other sins. … These are morality plays by seven contemporary writers, reinventing that genre for now.”
Moisés Kaufman — a Venezuelan-American director and playwright whose New York-based Tectonic Theater Project devised the award-winning “The Laramie Project” — co-founded Miami New Drama with Hausmann. He is directing his short play about greed, “All I Want Is Everything,” which features Mia Matthews as Vivian and Gerald McCullouch as Leo, a wealthy sister and brother at odds over their late father’s fortune.
“I immediately realized that this [project] was a brilliant idea. Everyone around the world is trying to figure out how to do theater in a pandemic,” Kaufman says. “There has been a great deal of attention to safety and to creating theater in these untenable times. There’s a hunger for theater.” Exploring greed Inspired in part by stories of fights within families, Kaufman’s play explores more than the lust for money. “Is greed only about money? Can you be greedy in love, in passion? We are all very, very greedy,” he says. Longtime friends Matthews and McCullouch believe their extensive experience in film and television will be of benefit in this unconventional theater project, which requires actors to perform their plays seven times a night on single-show days and 14 times on two-show days. “This merges the craft of acting for film and acting for live theater,” McCullouch says. “We have the experience [in film] of doing the same scene over and over. But in theater, we get to tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.” “Moisés has been shockingly collaborative. He has a beautiful energy and excitement,” adds Matthews. “At one point in rehearsals, he had us switch characters. I feel like I’m getting a master class from a legend.”
Envy is the subject of “Andre and Erica” by Hilary Bettis, whose “Queen of Basel” (a fresh take on “Miss Julie”) had a developmental production at Miami New Drama in 2018. Bettis, one of the writers of TV’s “The Americans” and the upcoming Amazon series “Rodeo Queens,” has crafted a play about two great pianists who happen to be former lovers. Andhy Mendez plays Andre, about to make his Carnegie Hall debut, and Renata Eastlick is his ex, Erica. “I feel envy is very much my Achilles’ heel as a human being,” Bettis says. “I wonder why this has been in my psyche for most of my life, and I don’t know why. It made me take a hard look at myself. It has driven me as a writer — I feel like my work is never good enough. … “I wrote about two people operating from the same place but also loving each other. All the wounds are still there. I thought it could be big, grand, theatrical. That it could pertain to any passion or pursuit.” Mendez, who appeared in Miami New Drama’s “The Cubans,” was in previews for the world premiere of Eduardo Machado’s “Celia and Fidel” at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., when the pandemic hit. He’s thrilled to be back at work after the hiatus and, though he wonders if performing “Andre and Erica” in a storefront will be like “acting inside of a snow globe,” he loves the play. “This script is phenomenal. There’s so much subtext. In just 10 pages, there’s a clear beginning, middle and end,” he says. “Whenever there’s chaos, that’s when art becomes an innovative, transformative platform.” Eastlick, a New World School of the Arts grad, says the “Seven Deadly Sins” project is “literally historic during a pandemic. Miami New Drama had the vision and insight to think outside the box. Zoom is not the same as having a live audience. This is avant-garde, rogue, the essence of theater.” Miami’s Carmen Peláez will be one of the busiest artists involved in “Seven Deadly Sins.” She penned “Strapped,” a solo show about pride starring Stephen G. Anthony, and will be performing a one-person play about wrath, “Memories in the Blood,” by Dael Orlandersmith.
Orlandersmith’s piece centers on someone simply called “Character,” a role designed to be played by a 30s-and-up actor of any race or gender — after all, pandemic isolation “is hitting us all the same,” says the playwright. On the rare occasions that the person leaves home to go to the market, he or she exchanges more words than usual with others, while at the same time memories of unhealed emotional wounds come flooding back. “Especially with the pandemic, a lot of time is being spent alone,” says Orlandersmith, an acclaimed playwright and actor who lives in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood. “A lot of anger comes up. You think about things you could have said, but it’s not simply a revenge trip. … Within this are aspects of loneliness, if you don’t know how to take care of yourself. … After the vaccine, some people will go back to the same old, same old. They don’t know what to do with themselves.”
Orlandersmith feels Peláez, who wrote and starred in the world premiere of “Fake” at Miami New Drama in 2019, is the right actor for her piece. “Carmen is open. She asks the right questions. She’s pliable and wonderful. And funny as hell,” she says. Now in actor mode, Peláez finds “Memories in the Blood” deeply resonant. “Dael’s work is amazing and super-challenging. As an actor, that’s what we live for. … It’s an aria, once you get started,” she says. “Not gendering the character speaks to the universality of the piece. If you’re in touch with the human condition, it lays you bare. Every time I perform it, it pierces back.” Peláez’s own play, “Strapped,” features Anthony as the come-to-life statue of John C. Calhoun, a pro-slavery South Carolina politician who served as the country’s seventh vice president from 1825 to 1832. In June, the statue was removed from its 115-foot-tall pedestal in Charleston, S.C., and her piece gives Calhoun some last words. In writing “Strapped,” Peláez says she wanted to examine “the absolute banality and cruelty of these people. … I can’t stand hypocrisy and injustice. They set me off like a rocket.” Of Anthony, the playwright says, “He knows how to play the charm and banality of the man. … He charms you, you see how heinous he was, then he calls you out.”
Another historical figure is at the center of Cuban-American playwright Rogelio Martinez’s “Itsy Bitsy Spider.” The sin in this case is gluttony, but the character’s voracious appetite isn’t for food. The man sitting at a piano, plunking out the tune of the children’s song that gives the play its title, is an out-of-office Richard M. Nixon, 37th president of the United States, and he is absolutely jonesing for a return to the spotlight. Gluttony and Richard Nixon “I wrote the play two months ago, before the election; you write a play that begins a conversation without knowing the result,” says Martinez. “I chose Nixon because I wanted to explore what it feels like to hold onto power, miss the spotlight, feel you’re needed. He had an appetite for it over four decades. They knocked him down, and he always got up again. There are all these levels. He’s Shakespearean.” Gregg Weiner plays Nixon opposite director Christopher Renshaw as Nigel, the ex-president’s recently hired assistant. “I felt intimidated about playing such a recognizable figure. He’s very layered and complex and fascinating. But even when you’re playing someone who’s perceived to be deplorable, you have to love them and advocate for them,” Weiner says. “I don’t want to play him like a ‘Saturday Night Live’ sketch or caricature. … I’ve been digesting interviews, documentaries, speeches. I want to give a flavor of him.” Renshaw, doing a now rare bit of acting in “Itsy Bitsy Spider,” sounds like the director he is when talking about Martinez’s play, “This play is very dense. In 10 minutes, it’s very precise and clear and detailed,” he says. “There’s so much that’s pertinent to the world today, what we’re living through. It’s visionary, and the language is very rich.”
Looking at “Seven Deadly Sins” as a whole, Weiner reiterates the back-to-theater excitement shared by the actors, directors, creative team and anyone aching for the return of an art form they love. “This has something for everyone,” he says. “It’s 90 minutes of high-end plays, fully produced, that no one’s ever seen before.” Adds managing director Richberg: “It’s living art on Lincoln Road.” With safety paramount, presenting the short plays of “Seven Deadly Sins” has required a complex and creative logistical plan from Miami New Drama. The company has taken over six empty storefronts in the 1100 block of Lincoln Road just west of the Colony Theatre, and it’s using the Colony’s loading dock as a seventh space. How to ‘Sin’ Safely A dozen masked audience members seated outside every space will watch each one- or two-person show, then move on to the next one, led from play to play by a guide. The total of 84 people per performance will see the actors performing inside the storefronts, and they’ll listen to the sound on souvenir earbuds that plug into each red audience chair (theatergoers who want to use their own earbuds can do so). Every seating area will have protective panels on either side. In the middle of the storefronts will be a bar dubbed Purgatory, which will also feature socially distanced seating. “Seven Deadly Sins” is also among a relatively small group of Actors’ Equity-approved live productions nationally. To get that approval, Miami New Drama established frequent testing protocols and required the actors in two-performer shows to be housed together, according to managing director Richberg. Every actor will have a private dressing room, and an elaborate ventilation system will ensure fresh air inside each space. All told, the production has 11 Equity contracts — more than 100 people, including designers, crew and others."

Facebook donates $1 million to Miami Foundation to tackle racial inequity 
By Rob Wile

Miami’s racial divisions run deep. One of the most powerful businesses in the world wants to help close the gap. On Friday, Facebook announced it was donating $1 million to The Miami Foundation’s Racial Equity Fund, created earlier this year to tackle racial injustice. “We’re providing funding directly to The Miami Foundation to build on their track record of supporting Black-led nonprofits and ensure that people locally are making the decisions about where these dollars are most needed and can have the most impact,” said Marcy Scott Lynn, director of global impact partnerships at Facebook, in a statement. In an email, Miami Foundation president and CEO Rebecca Fishman Lipsey said Facebook’s contribution, along with as much as $500,000 in matching funds the Foundation plans to raise, will be used to bolster local leaders and organizations focused on addressing systemic racism. In the coming months, three specific issues will be selected in collaboration with these groups to each be addressed using $500,000 in aid. The Foundation’s Racial Equity Fund was created in June following the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia to attempt to bridge racial divides in Greater Miami.
The Foundation seeded the fund with $100,000, and quickly raised another $80,000. Out of that initial round of funding came the South Florida Racial Justice Table, composed of the Fund’s first set of grantees. In an open letter to the community dated Sept. 9 and titled “South Florida Philanthropy Fails Black Led Orgs — Do Better,” the table called out what it said was a “widening resource gap among non-profit organizations in South Florida.” “White-led or white-passing Latinx-led organizations [are] accessing larger and more consistent funding than Black-led organizations focused on systems-change work (including policy advocacy and community organizing),” they wrote. Fishman Lipsey echoed the sentiment in her email Friday. “A major priority of our Racial Equity Fund is investing in Black leaders,” she wrote. “We have to trust the lived experience of residents confronting racism as we work to fight it. Their voice MUST be at the center of our strategy, and ultimately, the solutions.”
The question of racial justice in South Florida continues to be debated. This week, Broward County formed a racial equity task force that will seek to identify issues preventing racial equality, then create strategies to remove them. Commissioner Dale V.C. Holness, who sponsored the ordinance, made an economic argument for its creation, saying it could grow the county’s economy “by $5 trillion over the next five years.” Meanwhile, newly elected Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has said she plans to release a report following her first 100 days in office on “the progress that she and her administration have made to build a more equitable and inclusive Miami-Dade County.” Yet her move to hire Jimmy Morales as the county’s chief operating officer brought immediate denunciation from Miami-Dade’s NAACP chapter, which said Morales had singled out Black residents and tourists while serving as Miami Beach’s city manager. While the Miami Foundation may be the focus of Friday’s announcement, it is merely facilitating a region-wide effort, Fishman Lipsey said. “This is about the community — activists, residents, nonprofits, companies and elected officials, all standing together to tackle racism,” she said. “Systems of injustice are deep, far-reaching and multifaceted, so we need everyone united and working on solutions.”"

‘I’m young, Black and not all that impressed with Barack Obama’

Barack Obama has spent the past several months promoting his political memoir, “A Promised Land.” But the former president’s messaging is out of touch, tone-deaf and indicative of his personal and class interests. I’m Black and 20 years old. I wasn’t able to vote in either of Obama’s presidential races, but I can see his appeal today. In his television, radio and online appearances, Obama exudes presidential charm, while pushing narratives of respectability. This is unlike the ideals of “hope,” “change” and “progress” that he ran on in 2008. But let’s not forget how Obama chastised former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for the “pain” he caused others in taking a knee during the national anthem. And, more recently, the NBA rejoiced when Obama urged the Milwaukee Bucks to call off their strike protesting the Jacob Blake shooting. Obama also showed how out-of-touch he is with young progressives in a Dec. 2 Snapchat interview. “Socialism is still a loaded term for some folks,” he clucked. “We should focus on talking about getting certain things done.” The truth is, among young American adults, socialism is as popular an ideology as free-market capitalism, according to a 2019 Gallup poll. Maybe labels and ideology aren’t all that important. After all, voters in Florida — which went for Donald Trump — supported raising the state’s minimum wage to $15, an issue President-elect Joe Biden ran on.
In Obama’s recent Breakfast Club appearance, host Charlamagne tha God read an excerpt from “A Promised Land.” He asked if Obama felt it was still necessary, still, to soften “blunt truths” about racism in America, for white people’s benefit. Obama didn’t answer directly. Instead, mentioning polling after the murder of George Floyd, Obama said, “Many more white Americans were willing to acknowledge problems in the criminal-justice system based on race.” He said Black people need to build “coalitions” to win votes, and, “as a consequence,” must “pay attention to how other folks are feeling.” Obama has often lectured others against “snappy slogans” like “defund the police,” arising in response to decades of anti-Black policing. He’s told Black communities that he does not like our tone in how we call for safe communities — via divesting from policing and investing in Black communities — because it isn’t marketable to others. While polling does show that support for defunding the police is low, but polling does not accurately measure opinions on the Black Lives Matter movement’s concrete goals. Regardless, calls to “defund the police” were never supposed to be a political line for Democrats to run on. Yet, Democrats increased their voter registration in light of BLM protests. It’s clear Obama and Democrats don’t want to jeopardize white suburban and rural support. This year, Democrats performed better with both white men (with and without degrees), and college-graduate white women, compared to 2016.
And though Democrats took white voters from Trump, it was at the expense of voters of color, including Black people. With the exception of a handful of battleground states, the Democrats underperformed in Black, Latinx and Asian communities throughout the country. Obama’s book tour is just that, a book tour. Treating him as a thought leader for young people, or as the last “cool” president, is incorrect. His politics have always been that of a cautious centrist. His support for reforming broken systems, rather than the “Yes we can” attitude he fostered in 2008, makes him an inspiration best left in the past."

Cancel $50,000 in student loan debt? Democrats urge Biden to do that in new resolution
By Summer Lin

Democratic lawmakers introduced a resolution Thursday calling on President Joe Biden to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for every person holding such debt through executive action. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York held a press conference Thursday morning announcing the initiative alongside Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Reps. Mondaire Jones of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Alma Adams of North Carolina. The legislators linked the issues of racial inequality and student loan debt. “This is also a civil rights issue. A disproportionate burden of student debt falls on people of color often times because they were taken advantage of by a lot of these awful, despicable disgusting...for-profit colleges,” Schumer said at the conference. Warren added: “Canceling student loan debt is the single most effective executive action that President Biden can take to close the racial wealth gap.”
“The student debt crisis has always been a racial and economic justice issue,” Pressley said. “But too long, the narrative has excluded Black and Latinx communities and the ways in which this debt has exacerbated deeply entrenched racial and economic inequities in our nation.” A 2019 report by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy found that the median white borrowers had reduced their debt by 94% 20 years after entering repayment compared to the median black borrower who still owed 95% of their student loans after the same time span. Americans owed more than $1.7 trillion in student loan debt in quarter three of 2020 — an uptick of about 4% compared to quarter three of 2019, according to The Federal Reserve. Canceling $50,000 in student debt would reduce the country’s debt balance from $1.7 trillion to $700 billion, CNBC reported. It would mean 80% of federal student loan borrowers, accounting for 36 million people, would be completely free of federal debt, higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told the publication.
Biden has previously expressed skepticism that the president has the power to cancel student loan debt through executive action. “That’s different than my saying, and I’m going to get in trouble for saying this . . . for example, it’s arguable that the president may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt,” Biden told The Washington Post. “Well, I think that’s pretty questionable. I’m unsure of that. I’d be unlikely to do that.” Biden’s officials said the president still supports canceling $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower, CNBC reported. Schumer and Warren have asserted that Biden has the power to cancel debt through the “existing authority under the Higher Education Act.” Some experts have raised similar doubts about such executive actions, saying bypassing Congress could be met with legal challenges. “Using an executive order to forgive federal student loans will likely be met with a lawsuit and preliminary injunction, and eventually fail,” Kantrowitz told CNBC. “Also, trying that route immediately upon taking office would block any attempt at working with Congress in a bipartisan manner.” Financial planner Ryan Brown of CR Myers & Associates told Forbes that legal scholars believe that federal loan debt falls under Congress’ commerce, taxing or taxing powers and “that an Executive Order issued by the President would be an overreach of constitutional authority as a result.” Education Department officials under former President Donald Trump’s administration released a memo in January arguing that the agency doesn’t have the power to forgive student loan debt either. The memo states that “the Secretary does not have statutory authority to provide blanket or mass cancellation, compromise, discharge, or forgiveness of student loan principal balances, and/or to materially modify the repayment amounts or terms thereof, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason.” Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called the proposals to cancel federal student loan debt “crazy.” “Their proposals are crazy,” DeVos told Fox News in 2019. “Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It’s going to be two of the three Americans that aren’t going to college paying for the one out of three that do.”"

How one group pushed young Latino voters to register: Letting them Google how to do it
By Adam Wollner

A group of progressives think they have unlocked a more effective way to register scores of young Latino voters: let them do most of the legwork on their own. The nonprofit organization Voto Latino, working with the Democratic digital marketing firm Rising Tide Interactive, ran a series of targeted online video ads ahead of voter registration deadlines in the 2020 election in three key Latino-heavy states — Florida, Texas and Arizona. Instead of providing viewers with detailed instructions or directing them to a particular website, the public service announcement-style ads simply informed them of the registration deadline to vote in the presidential election. The idea was that younger people in general were capable of finding the information themselves on Google, and would be more likely to follow through and register if they took the time to search for it. “Monday is the voter registration deadline in Arizona. This means that to vote in the presidential election, you have until this Monday to make sure you’re registered to vote,” said the narrator of a Voto Latino ad that ran in Arizona ahead of the Oct. 5 deadline. “Registering to vote is quick, easy and important. But you only have until Monday to get it done.” It was an unconventional strategy. Typically, political groups actively push potential voters to click on ads on social media sites like Facebook to lead them to a specific place to register, while deploying video ads to persuade them to support one candidate over another.
But officials with Voto Latino and Rising Tide found that pairing informational video ads geared toward younger Latinos on platforms such as YouTube, sports sites and gaming apps with the more traditional ads on Facebook had a clear impact. Ameer Patel, Voto Latino’s director of data and analytics, said the campaign resulted in upwards of 65,000 new voter registrants over just five days in the closely divided states of Arizona, Florida and Texas. “Inform them at the right place and the right time, and they will take the action on their own,” Patel said. “There’s a high correlation between, if you get someone to search, they will register.” Officials with Voto Latino and Rising Tide now argue that the ad campaign could provide a blueprint heading into the 2022 midterm elections and beyond for Democrats as they seek to make further inroads with young and Latino voters, who are critical to the party’s coalition but historically turn out infrequently. “This is a template and a strategy that is going to be used over and over again going forward,” said Eli Kaplan, a founding partner of Rising Tide.
Nationally, Latino voters under the age of 30 only made up around 4% of the overall electorate, up slightly from 2016, according to exit polls. But they are becoming more important to Democrats’ success as increasingly diverse states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia emerge as battlegrounds. The outcome of Voto Latino’s November strategy encouraged them to invest in similar ads for the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia, which has a small but growing Latino population. The video ads played an even greater role after Google, Facebook and other social media sites implemented political ad bans after the November election. Patel said their ads, which ran for one week, helped register at least 10,000 new voters ahead of the twin Jan. 5 Georgia elections, both of which were decided by less than 100,000 votes and gave Democrats control of the Senate. “Groups like Voto Latino were vital to the successful team effort to turn out the most diverse electorate in Georgia runoff history,” said Hillary Holley, the organizing director for Fair Fight, a national voting rights group based in Georgia. “Voto Latino’s innovative and culturally competent voter contract strategies helped drive Latinx turnout beyond expectations, and we are proud to have supported that critical work.” TEST RUNS IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA Voto Latino and Rising Tide first tested their new ad theory ahead of the voter registration deadline for the Texas primary elections in February 2020. The groups conducted a study that found that adults in Texas who saw their informative ads aimed at younger Latinos were nine times more likely to search for voter registration terms than those who had not. Next, the groups wanted to determine how likely those ad viewers were to actually complete the registration process after searching for the information. So they partnered with the progressive analytics firm Bluelabs to run a live scientific experiment over 10 days in Florida ahead of the state’s July primary registration deadline. The experiment set up three groups: one that was exposed to the informational video ads and the more traditional Facebook ads, one that was exposed to just Facebook ads, and one group that wasn’t exposed to either.
The results showed that young Latinos in the group that was exposed to both types of ads were roughly 16% more likely to register to vote than the group that wasn’t shown any ads. Meanwhile, the experiment didn’t find a statistical difference between the group with just Facebook ads and the group without any ads in terms of their likelihood to register. “Normally you want people to go to your site. But they don’t want to disrupt their viewing experience to click on an ad,” Patel said. “Just getting people information at the moment they need it leads to a more effective campaign.” The results provided Voto Latino with enough confidence to spend $1.2 million on the informative video ads across Arizona, Florida, Texas and eventually Georgia. That campaign only accounted for a fraction of the group’s overall efforts in the 2020 elections. Voto Latino spent a total of $15 million on registration, and helped sign up more than 600,000 new voters combined in 11 states. But officials with the group said the ads will be a much more prominent part of their strategy moving forward as Democrats aim to keep states like Arizona and Georgia in their column and make gains in places like Florida and Texas, where Republicans performed unexpectedly well with Latino voters in 2020. “The power of youth Latino turnout is just absolutely enormous,” Kaplan said. “In terms of flipping states like Arizona, that is the whole ballgame.”"

‘All I feel is stress.’ Student survey reveals crushing pressure in pandemic learning
By Katie Camero

Grades. Tests. Homework. Lack of sleep. Students today are stressed out about the same things as students taking classes before the coronavirus completely restructured the education system, but the pandemic has added worrisome bumps along the road. A survey of more than 10,000 high school students conducted during the fall shows that kids are experiencing high levels of stress and pressure, have little desire to be engaged with school work and are feeling disconnected from teachers and peers — sentiments that bear heavier weights on girls and non-white communities. A school reform non-profit called Challenge Success, which is affiliated with the Stanford Graduate School of Education, teamed with NBC News to capture students’ well-being as they try to navigate education amid a pandemic. The survey posted this month incorporates student responses from fall 2018 through fall 2020, including over 75,000 kids from 86 high schools across the country. “I would do anything for things to go back to normal. My school is giving too much work even though times are tough for everyone,” an anonymous 10th grader reported. “At first this was just a break from school, but now all I feel is stress, anxiety, and pain.”
Fifty-six percent of students reported their stress about school has increased during the pandemic; with students who identified as female (63%) feeling that burden more than those who identified as male (48%). Black and Hispanic/Latinx students (63%) also felt more stress trying to learn during the pandemic than their white classmates (55%), a disparity also found in the general population when it comes to employment and access to medical care and COVID-19 vaccines. And for those with college on the horizon, 59% reported feeling extra stressed about life after high school — again affecting students who identified as female (67%) more than those male (50%). Although homework is usually a source of stress for many students, more than 50% of survey participants said the amount of homework they get is “too much,” with students reporting an average of three hours of homework per weeknight. That average stood at 2.7 hours a weeknight in the fall of 2019, according to the survey.
Meanwhile, 60% said the majority of their assignments were not “useful.” “Because the school day has been shortened, teachers feel that it is okay to make the workload very large because it seems like we have more time,” another anonymous 10th grader said. “My more ‘essential’ classes give us 30-minute videos to learn concepts on our own, in addition to the nightly homework.”
Students are also sleeping less during the pandemic. Forty-three percent of students said the amount of sleep they get each night has decreased since before the coronavirus hit, while only 6.6% get the recommended nine hours of sleep per night; 5% get four or fewer hours of sleep a night, the survey found. Research shows that quality of sleep is associated with mental and physical health, something students also reported as being a major source of stress (32%) compared to before the pandemic (26%). Students who identified as female reported their mental health as sources of stress two times more than those who identified as male. These feelings also translated to drops in effort at school, the survey found — 41% of students reported lower effort during class and 42% said they felt less engaged while learning. At the same time, about half of the students said they felt disconnected from peers and teachers, who 28% of participants believe don’t “understand their life outside of school,” according to the survey. Another 28% said teachers don’t understand the challenges they’re experiencing during the pandemic.
On a more positive note, students said they generally have an adult they can talk over problems with, but fewer students from schools with primarily “socioeconomically disadvantaged students” reported having an adult to go to. “To improve remote learning, our school could implement more emotional connections with teachers and other students. Especially check-ins on our mental and physical health. By understanding what is going on in our lives and what we’re going through, it would improve how much and what kind of work they give us. It would relieve a lot of stress,” an anonymous 12th grader said."

How does obesity raise risks for severe COVID? CDC report looks at the data
By Katie Camero

An analysis of nearly 150,000 COVID-19 patients across the nation found that adults with obesity faced higher risks for hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation and death, especially among individuals younger than 65, than those in healthy and overweight categories. About 51% of coronavirus patients in the study had obesity, compared to about 42% of adults in the U.S. population, suggesting that individuals affected by obesity are more likely to develop severe COVID-19, with risks increasing as body mass index (BMI) does, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Monday. The study comes as states begin to open access to COVID-19 vaccines for people with obesity, which the CDC considers a high-risk medical condition. That’s because the disease is also a risk factor for other chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. Authors of the report also highlight the need to “promote and support healthy BMI” for Hispanic, Latinx and Black adults, as well as individuals from low-income homes, who are disproportionately affected by obesity and are more likely to suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19 compared to white people. “As clinicians develop care plans for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs, especially for those with severe obesity,” the report said. “These findings highlight the clinical and public health implications of higher BMIs, including the need for intensive COVID-19 illness management as obesity severity increases, promotion of COVID-19 prevention strategies including continued vaccine prioritization and masking, and policies to ensure community access to nutrition and physical activities that promote and support a healthy BMI.”
The CDC analyzed data on 148,494 adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to one of 238 hospitals in the U.S. between March and December 2020 — about 28% of patients were considered overweight and about 51% were considered obese. Risks for coronavirus-related hospitalization, admission into an intensive care unit and death were lowest among patients with BMIs in the healthy and overweight categories, but those risks “increased sharply” with increasing BMI, the report said. The researchers said their findings support the hypothesis that people affected by obesity may face high risks for severe disease because of inflammation caused by excess weight that disrupts immune responses to viruses such as the novel coronavirus. Impaired lung function from excess weight may also contribute to increased risks, the report said. Similar high risks were found among people in the underweight category. Adults who had BMIs that were considered underweight had a 20% higher risk of hospitalization than those with BMIs in the healthy weight category. The researchers say this “could be explained by uncaptured underlying medical conditions or impairments in essential nutrient availability and immune response.”
Only adults who received care at a hospital and had their height and weight reported in their medical records were included in the study, the report said, which may affect the true nature of risks people with obesity and COVID-19 face. And although a large number of patients were studied, the results are still “not representative of the entire U.S. patient population,” according to the CDC."

Another legal challenge filed against new restrictions on voting by mail in Florida
By Jim Saunders

Alleging discrimination against Black and Latino voters, a coalition of groups has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new Florida election law that includes additional restrictions on voting by mail. The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. district court in Tallahassee is at least the third challenge to the law, which was passed last month by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis during an appearance on Fox News. The law (SB 90) was one of the most controversial issues of the 2021 legislative session and came after a relatively smooth 2020 election in Florida. Republican lawmakers contended the changes were needed to ensure election security and prevent fraud in future elections. But the lawsuit filed Monday on behalf of the groups Florida Rising Together, Faith in Florida, UnidosUS, the Equal Ground Education Fund, the Hispanic Federation and Poder Latinx, contends that the changes dealing with issues such as voting by mail could curtail voting by Black and Latino residents. “While SB 90 imposes unjustified burdens on all voters, it places disproportionate burdens on Black voters, Latino voters, disabled voters, and voters who face greater challenges in exercising the right to vote, even in the best of circumstances,” the 91-page lawsuit said. “SB 90 imposes specific obstacles on voters’ ability to cast ballots through in-person voting, mail voting, and the use of secure drop boxes for early voting.”
The lawsuit alleges violations of the federal Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. It names as defendants Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Highlands County Supervisor of Elections Penny Ogg, Gadsden County Supervisor of Elections Shirley Green Knight, Osceola County Supervisor of Elections Mary Jane Arrington and Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer. The four supervisors are named as representatives of the rest of Florida’s county election supervisors. Four areas of new law in dispute The challenge seeks an injunction and focuses on four parts of the new law: Restrictions on the availability and use of drop boxes, where residents can drop off vote-by-mail ballots. The lawsuit contends, in part, that the additional restrictions will particularly affect people who work during the day and voters seeking to avoid long lines at polls. Identification requirements for requesting vote-by-mail ballots. The lawsuit contends that the requirements could prevent many people from obtaining vote-by-mail ballots.
Restrictions on providing such things as food and water to people waiting in line to vote. The lawsuit contends that areas with large numbers of Black and Latino voters have traditionally had longer wait times for voting and that churches and other organizations have provided food, water and other aid to voters. A requirement that third-party voter registration groups provide a disclaimer to people signing up to vote. The lawsuit contends that disclaimer “is intended to and will have a chilling effect on third-party voter registration organizations.” Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature and other GOP-led legislatures across the country moved quickly this year to change election laws as former President Donald Trump has falsely blamed “rigged” and fraudulent elections for Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in November. Courts rejected numerous lawsuits in which Trump and his supporters challenged the handling of the November elections. Trump defeated Biden handily in Florida. DeSantis’ strong support During an appearance May 6 on the Fox News show “Fox & Friends” to sign the Florida bill, DeSantis called it the “strongest election integrity measures in the country” and said it “keeps us ahead of the curve” after the 2020 election. “We’re not resting on our laurels, and me signing this bill here says, ‘Florida, your vote counts, your vote is going to be cast with integrity and transparency, and this is a great place for democracy,’ ” DeSantis said. But the law was immediately hit with two lawsuits from groups such as the League of Women Voters of Florida, the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, Disability Rights Florida and Common Cause. Those cases are pending. The lawsuit Monday was filed on behalf of the other groups by attorneys from the Advancement Project National Office, Demos, LatinoJustice PRLDEF and the national law firm Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. It pointed to a history in Florida of efforts to discriminate against Black and Latino voters. “Florida’s recent legislation attacking the voting rights of its Black and Latino residents is like a virus attacking the human heart,” the lawsuit said. “Without a remedy to undo the effects, our democracy will die.”"

Code Fever Miami founder Felecia Hatcher named CEO of new minority entrepreneurship project
By Rob Wile

A longtime local innovator and champion for minority tech entrepreneurs in Miami is taking on a new role. Felecia Hatcher, founder of the Center for Black Innovation (formerly Code Fever Miami), has been named CEO of Black Ambition, a new initiative from artist and musician Pharrell Williams to fund ideas and companies led by Black and Latinx entrepreneurs via prize competitions. “Excited to lead this! Excited to be in a position to directly fund founders,” Hatcher wrote in a Facebook post. “The best part....although a nationally focused organization, we will be based in Miami.” In a separate post announcing her departure from the Center, Hatcher remarked on her tenure leading the pioneering local entrepreneur group. “We’ve connected Black entrepreneurs to over $10 million in funding and capital opportunities (and still counting) and built a platform that has brought some of the most successful founders, investors, entrepreneurs, business professionals, techies, dreamers, and disrupters to our BTW stages and to Overtown, and so much more.
“Our goal is for Miami to become THE CENTER FOR BLACK INNOVATION!” she added."

‘We have to begin to build.’ Meet Miami Gardens, the epicenter of Dade’s Black middle class
By C. Isaiah Smalls II and Andres Viglucci 

The little things struck Fathiyyah Doster first. More lawns were being groomed on a regular basis. The trash had disappeared from the sidewalks. Fresh coats of asphalt covered the main roadways. In 2005, Doster returned to her hometown of Miami Gardens following her college graduation. What she saw was unrecognizable. For the first time, the city appeared determined to create its own identity — and she wanted to stay. “I thought that Miami Gardens would grow into this hub for the Black community,” said Doster, now 36 and owner of juicing company “JuiceDefined,” started out of the home that she purchased from her parent. In the 15 years since, Miami Gardens has done precisely that. And it’s done a much better job of it than most people outside of the increasingly alluring orbit of Miami Gardens seem to realize. The city’s 2020 All-America City title, an honor bestowed on communities working to address local issues, is proof. Crafted from a patchwork of majority-Black subdivisions and commercial districts split up by expressways, Miami Gardens was explicitly conceived by its founders in 2003 as a demonstration of what could happen if Black Miamians were allowed to seize control of their own affairs under favorable conditions.
It succeeded. Though perhaps best known to outsiders as the home of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami-Dade’s northwest reaches, Miami Gardens has almost stealthily built itself into a rare oasis in the county: A majority Black city that provides its residents with stable middle-class neighborhoods, a solid municipal government, plenty of nationally branded shopping supplemented by a smorgasbord of Caribbean and soul-food restaurants, and small businesses. With elected leaders who reflect the majority of residents – 70% of its 113,000 residents identify as Black – there is a widespread pride of place and opportunity for advancement, not least thanks to the uncommon fortune of having two full-fledged universities inside city boundaries. And in the view of Mayor Oliver Gilbert, Miami Gardens is also persuasive evidence that Black Miami-Dade residents can, if given opportunity and support, overcome longstanding obstacles stemming from decades of discrimination, bigotry and disadvantage.
Not everything is perfect, of course. Median household income ($42,398) remains lower than the state average ($53,267). The poverty rate (21.7-percent) is roughly double that of the United States (10.5-percent). High schools in the area, as with many in primarily Black communities, also fell below the county’s “A” average: Norland has a “B” while Carol City has a “C.” But crime, once high, has been plummeting, and policing, at times fraught by claims of racism, has improved thanks in part to efforts to make the force better reflect the city’s makeup. In the past decade, the city has attracted national chain retailers and dining spots, including a Walmart Supercenter, a Burlington and brand-new Starbucks that, pre-Covid, had become a center for civic gatherings. The real estate world has also taken notice: a California developer is building the Miami Gardens’ first mixed-use development on 17 acres near the Hard Rock, and word is that new hotels – the city has long lacked quality hostelry – may be on the way. Despite its brief existence, Miami Gardens has transformed itself from bedroom community to near full-service suburban city where residents can prosper, work, go to school and play without undue fear of encountering the casual racism that’s a daily fact of life for many Black Miami-Dade residents. Many neighborhoods project a sense of ease. Black teens wander along laughing and smiling. Elderly women are more likely to wave at strangers than clutch at their purses. Neighbors watch out for each other’s kids as if they were their own.
There’s a little something for everyone inside the 20 square miles that make up Miami Gardens. No longer just the game-day home of the Miami Dolphins or the Hurricanes, the city now finds itself as a player on the national stage where festivals like Jazz in the Gardens and Rolling Loud draw tens of thousands of visitors. Like close-knit immigrant enclaves such as Little Havana and Little Haiti, the city looks to be an integral part of Miami-Dade County’s economic and political future. “Our being able to stake out a claim for ourselves is important,” said Tameka Bradley Hobbs, a history professor and associate provost at Florida Memorial who also serves as the university historian. “To have a community where we have thriving institutions such as Florida Memorial makes it attractive for Black people to come and thrive and live. I think we have all the ingredients. I see it and we hunger for it. “This is not about separation. We are part of this country, but we have different needs because we continue to be excluded. We can’t wait for people to do right by us. We have to begin to build.” ‘We all took ownership’ Miami Gardens’ wasn’t always primarily Black. Back when the area was known by its neighborhoods like Carol City and the Bahas, the demographics skewed more white. Integration in the late 1960s began to change the city’s racial makeup. By the 1990 Census, the Black population had exploded by more than 10,000% to 29,000, according to “Black Miami in the Twentieth Century,” by historian Marvin Dunn. The racial makeup changed as Carol City and growing subdivisions around it became a place Black people in Miami aspired to live – a middle-class enclave of mostly new, single-family homes with yards at prices within reach. It was a clean, attractive alternative to the turmoil of Liberty City and other historically Black neighborhoods in Miami. “It became a kind of middle ground for the Black community,” Richelle Williams-Lorde, the executive pastor at Jesus People Ministries Church, said. “My mom grew up in this community. She’s still in this community. This community meant something to our parents. People were vying to be part of [it] .... It was a community to look up to.”
That middle-class base created a stability that endured even through economic downturns and spikes in crime, and today underlies Miami Gardens’ sustained growth, said Williams-Lorde, 43. City leaders tout the home ownership rate — 63.9%, outpacing the county’s 51.6%— and affordability. The median value of owner-occupied homes sits just under $171,000, roughly $100,000 less than that of the Miami-Dade County. Like many, Williams-Lorde credits Gilbert — now in his eighth year as mayor and recently elected to the County Commisson — his predecessors and an “impeccable” city administration. When Gilbert promised commercial development during his 2012 campaign, he remembers people calling him crazy. The proof is in his track record. The Marshalls? A product of Gilbert’s ability to market Miami Gardens. The Starbucks? Also Gilbert. The Top Golf? Gilbert again. “It became proof of concept that you could actually have a business [here], you can invest millions of dollars and your return on investment could be more than you actually anticipated,” Gilbert explained. While recruiting brand name restaurants and retailers proved the city’s viability, Gilbert also continued the work of his predecessor Mayor Shirley Gibson when it came to boosting civic pride. Initiatives like Live Healthy Miami Gardens, encouraging healthy eating and exercise, supplemented more tangible actions like renovating Buccaneer Park, Bunche Park and the Betty T. Ferguson Recreational Complex.
Such community investment wouldn’t be possible without Gibson’s foundation. A Miami-Dade police officer turned political leader, Gibson helmed the city from its inception in 2003 until terming out in 2012. Community cleanups, paving roadways and improved landscaping became hallmarks of her tenure. “Businesses, churches, other organizations, nonprofits — we all took ownership,” Gibson said. If left to county government, she added, the area would never have seen its current success. By emphasizing neighborhood beautification, Gibson — and subsequently Gilbert — managed to create a community that’s more akin to a family. Neighbors look out for each other’s kids. The local grocer knows residents’ names. Homes will stay in families for generations. But much like Dade’s Black population as a whole, Miami Gardens suffered the consequences of being seen as second-rate. Its early years were plagued with high crime numbers, caused in part by the county’s initial lackluster policing and, following the creation of the Miami Gardens police in 2004, a force whose officers didn’t reflect the community. Some also believe that the city’s location at the convergence of three major highways — the Florida Turnpike, Palmetto Expressway and Interstate 95 — contributed to its initial high numbers as criminals had easy access to the area.
In 2004, Miami Gardens police reported a total crime index — a figure measuring the number of property and violent crimes — of 8,475, the fifth highest figure in Miami-Dade County. That number has fallen by 39% in the past 15 years, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The County’s displacement of Black residents, which in this case meant the demolishing of project homes in Liberty City, also played a role. In Gibson’s view, the county essentially pawned off Black Miamians “neglected by the system” on Miami Gardens with barely enough means to pay their rent. It was an unpopular opinion at the time but Gibson has maintained her stance, though she chooses her words carefully to avoid demonizing every person who moved from Liberty City north to Miami Gardens. She settles on this: it wasn’t fair to the actual individuals, the city or its residents. “They do not send those renters to more affluent communities,” she said. DAMNING MONIKER The mid-2000s saw the emergence of the “Murder Gardens” moniker. Birthed in the isolated pockets of the city, the name soon became synonymous with its reputation, especially following the release of an eponymous film in 2019. Gilbert takes issue with that title. “Crime exists all over South Florida, but if something happens in Miami Gardens, it’s always going to make news if it’s negative,” he said. Bradley Hobbs blames the nation’s cruel history of racism for stereotypes that criminalize Blackness and brand the enclaves inhabited primarily by those of African descent as places to be avoided. American society struggles “with the automatic assumption that people with Black skin have predilections for criminality,” Bradley Hobbs explained. “It operates not only on the individual level but magnifies when you have large numbers of African-Americans congregating together or, if you look at some place like Miami Gardens, living together.”
Gilbert also points a finger at directly residents who fueled the narrative. “If they tell you that every young black man in Miami Gardens is violent, then you believe it and you start to perpetuate it and you start to repeat it,” he said. Mark Samuels, the auteur of the “Murder Gardens” film, stands by his use of the name. Born in Jamaica, Samuels moved to the area formerly known as Carol City in the mid-1980s and has been there ever since. The uproar created by the title was misplaced, he says, considering that his project seeks to undo some of the stereotypes ascribed to Black families.
“I don’t want to paint this picture like Miami Gardens is a city where you have to wear a bulletproof vest to drive through there,” said Samuels, 37. And he’s right. Miami Gardens’ overall crime rate has dropped about 44% since 2004, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. As recently as 2016, its crime rate per 100,000 was lower than affluent Aventura, the city of Miami and the county as a whole. The latest data shows the rate at 5,152, which is lower than Miami Beach and about on par with the city of Miami. While crime overall is down, homicides remain a troubling issue. In 2019, the Miami Gardens’ murder count reached a new high of 26 — a figure still less than the city of Miami’s 43. Samuels agrees Miami Gardens has made progress, but notes that it doesn’t stretch citywide. Some residents still refer to their home as “Murder Gardens” and, more often than not, live in pockets untouched by the city’s economic prosperity. With more films planned under his production company MBS Media Group, he’s hoping to change that by replicating an integral part of “Murder Gardens” — staffing the entire project with local residents. “Multiple people in this film don’t have experience in film so I gave a lot of opportunities to a lot of different people who now can take that and move on to another film or get a full-time job or take that knowledge because that’s how you break the economic gap,” he added.
‘There should be a primarily Black city that runs well’
One thing Miami Gardens lacks is an urban focal point. Laid out and developed mostly under low-density suburban zoning prior to incorporation, it’s a rectilinear grid of mostly single-family homes separated by strip-style commercial development along broad, high-speed arterials. The city has seen little in the way of new housing construction or the type of mixed-use projects blending residential with commercial development that have led to the creation of urban “downtown” hubs in Miami-Dade suburbs like Kendall and Doral in recent years. But that’s changing. In 2015, the city inaugurated a gleaming new, $55-million city hall and police headquarters complex in a sharp contemporary architectural style – a sure sign of Miami Garden’s high aspirations. A mile north, next to a new Walmart Supercenter, a California developer has begun work on a nearly 17-acre mixed-use project. Built around an artificial lake, the Center at Miami Gardens will encompass mid-rise apartments with a 5,000-square-foot clubhouse and a “resort-style” swimming pool, as well as companion stand-alone commercial space and a 24 Hour Fitness gym. The first phase of the Center’s 259-unit apartment complex, The Pomelo, broke ground in October and scored a $50 million construction loan early this year, with expected completion in 2021.
The developers, The Latigo Group out of Los Angeles, did not respond to requests for an interview. But in news releases and its website, the developers said the apartments will rent at “mid-tier” rates to fill a gap in the local market. Gilbert has said the apartments will diversify the city’s housing stock and serve as a lure for young professionals who can later buy a home in Miami Gardens. “People see Black cities and they assume that housing that has to come here has to be affordable housing,” Gilbert explained. “And let me be clear. We have an affordable housing shortage in South Florida, but we don’t have one in Miami Gardens because the value of the single family homes... are suppressed.” Having Hard Rock Stadium helps. Though many residents are quick to disparage the stadium for disrupting neighborhood serenity during fall weekends, its economic impact on Miami Gardens is irreplaceable as not just the city’s top taxpayer but also one of the biggest private donors, Gilbert says. Residents, however, remain concerned about plans for a Formula 1 race at the stadium that have stirred local resentment; the Dolphins early this year altered the proposed course to allay concerns. Hard Rock Stadium “creates jobs and economic opportunity,” Gilbert said. “One of the things that I do when I’m out selling economic development is I talk about the fact that we have a stadium that we can use as an anchor so we know that people will come here.” It also helps to have two institutions for higher learning — the historically Black Florida Memorial and St. Thomas, a Catholic institution— within the city limits. That’s unusual for a city its size – and a decided boost to its real-estate market appeal, St. Thomas University President David Armstrong notes. “From a real-estate perspective, having a college or university in your town always ranks your city higher,” he said. It’s also good for small businesses in the vicinity, he added.
“All those students bring dollars to Miami Gardens,” Armstrong said. “I guarantee you, in a two-mile area around our campus, all those businesses are happy that we’re here.” Though it falls slightly outside St. Thomas’ two mile radius, Lorna’s Caribbean surely benefits from having two universities in such close proximity. The restaurant, located off of the 27th Avenue corridor by Hard Rock Stadium, has become a staple in the area that its owner Matari Bodie calls “downtown Miami Gardens.”
“It’s a lot of big business coming in ‘downtown Miami Gardens,’” Bodie said. “That’s why I call it that — because there’s a lot of big business is coming here now.” Born in the Bahamas but raised in Carol City, Bodie and his mother Lorna opened up the eatery as a takeout spot inside the landmark Carol Mart flea market in 2004. The demolition of the market could’ve signaled the end. Bodie had other plans: an upscale dine-in restaurant complete with a bar and live music. Situated just a mile from the stadium, the latest iteration of Lorna’s opened in 2016. “When [fans] leave the game, they don’t have to go way out to the Hard Rock [Hollywood] or South Beach,” he added. “They have a nice place to come.” Bodie’s success gives credence to Miami Gardens’ reputation as a melting pot of sorts, one where strivers from the inner city blend well with immigrants from the Bahamas, Haiti and Latin America. This ethos dates back to Gibson’s tenure as mayor, when she declared the city “a community for everyone,” a rather prescient stance. “I made that statement [for the future] — we are inclusive to everyone who’s here though, population-wise, we are a primarily Black city,” she explained. Already known for its robust Caribbean community, Miami Gardens’ has also seen an influx of Latinx individuals. The latest Census data shows the city’s Latino population has increased roughly 25-percent since 2010. Miami Gardens’ increasing diversity appears to have paralleled its economic development. Elysee has seen her hometown – once simply “Miami” — transformed from bedroom community to full-fledged, full-service city, she said. The old flea market, Clover Leaf bowling alley and the skating rink — all highlights of her teenage years — are gone, replaced by Burlington, Ross Dress for Less and Old Navy — reducing her trips to Aventura and Miramar. Alongside the chains, she said, locally owned hair and nail salons, restaurants, bakeries and other businesses have also sprouted. In her generation, she noted, many left Miami. But family and Miami Gardens are now drawing them back. “Friends of mine have gone away to Atlanta and California,” Elysee said. “Our parents are aging a lot, so they are deciding to move back. They tend to say, ‘I miss this place. I miss the music.’”
Doster’s own return 15 years ago has worked out. Her parents’ home has tripled in value. Her juicing business has taken off, and she recently purchased a brick-and- mortar operation in Opa-locka. The brain drain that once drove Black Miamians to Broward County, Atlanta or other places in search of community seems to be less of a factor in Miami Gardens, something she helped contributed to. “Miami is paradise,” she concluded. “There should be a primarily Black city that runs well.”"

Teen’s diploma in jeopardy after he wore Mexican flag to NC high school graduation
By Mark Price

A teen who wore a full-sized flag of Mexico to his high school graduation ceremony in North Carolina is at risk of not getting his diploma. Video posted on Facebook by Asheboro City Schools shows the student had the flag draped like a cape over his graduation gown during the ceremony Thursday. The identity of the student was not released. District officials say the ensemble was a blatant disregard for the event’s strict dress code and they are in discussions with the teen and his family over the fate of his diploma. Asheboro is about 75 miles northeast of Charlotte. “Our graduation dress code is clearly shared with students ahead of time, and the wearing of a flag of any kind is a violation of the dress code,” the district said in a release.
“We continue working to resolve this issue with the student and his family so that he will receive his diploma from Asheboro High School. He has worked very hard and we commend him on this great achievement. We are confident in his abilities and we know he has a bright future ahead of him.” The video shows the student was delayed by a school official on the stage, and he is seen unsuccessfully attempting to remove the flag, which was pinned around his neck. The school official eventually hands him a diploma holder and he exits to audience cheers, with the flag still around his neck. “Immediately following the ceremony, school officials denied him his diploma in a closed-door meeting with his parents, and four police officers were called to escort them from the building,” officials with the Latinx organization Siembra NC said in a June 6 press release. “He has still not yet received his diploma.” The organization identified the student as Ever López.
District officials say a graduation ceremony dress code permits “students to decorate their mortar boards as a nod to their individuality and creativity,” but no other deviations are accepted on the “standard cap and gown regalia.” The district’s explanation was shared on social media Friday amid growing criticism of the school’s handling of the incident. The statement racked up nearly 3,000 reactions and more than 900 comments in a day, including calls to fire Asheboro High Principal Penny Crooks. (The district later cut off the ability to comment on the post.) Critics called the incident racist, anti-Mexican, and an example of modern day colonialism, because the flag includes symbols of Central Mexico’s indigenous Aztec people. “Your staff withholding a diploma in exchange to put his flag down is a form of colonization,” Maria Marquez posted on the school district’s Facebook page. “Y’all need to apologize to this young man and his family for ruining one of the most important nights of his life because he chose to wear HIS FLAG,” Celine Cantu wrote. “You have your standards for cap and gown regalia...and he deviated. So what? That does not warrant humiliation and a withholding of his diploma, which he earned,” Michelle Villa said. Some supported the district’s decision, noting the dress code was made clear in advance. “If we have the right to break the rules, we also have an obligation to accept the consequences,” V. Carolina Agüero posted.
District officials acknowledged the criticism in a second Facebook post and said they were “disheartened” by the accusations. “The incident at AHS last night has been misrepresented across a number of social media platforms. The heart of the issue is the fact that the student did not follow the established dress code for the event and detracted from the importance and the solemnity of the ceremony,” the district said. “The student attended and fully participated in the graduation ceremonies at AHS. ... This incident is not about the Mexican flag. Students were encouraged to express their identity by decorating their mortar boards. A number of students followed the protocol and had the Mexican flag and other representations appropriately displayed during the ceremony.”"

LGBTQ+ people are the most targeted by hate speech on social media
By Kiki Monifa

It’s 2021, the pandemic is ongoing, although more and more people are now vaccinated. Many people are still flocking to the internet and social media in search of connection. For some, it is an oasis. For others, a nightmare. Woke folks are aware of #StopAsianHate, #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo, hashtags meant to draw attention to the oppression of people based on race and gender. As a lesbian of African descent, I have felt the weight of hate. Despite the ray of hope created by the guilty verdicts against Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd, I am forever reminded of how far we have to go. Most of what I see on social media is not specifically directed at me, but comes rather in the form of posts that deny the existence of homophobia in general, allow misgendering or “deadnaming,” spread misinformation and misquote famous folks under the umbrella of “straight pride” and are tainted with fear and hatred.
Personally, I don’t want the triggers. I have never seen the entire video of Chauvin as he kills George Floyd; likewise, I do not dwell on online hate and harassment against anyone. I am, however, grateful that others are examining online hate and harassment. For instance, in May, the advocacy group GLAAD released its first “Social Media Safety Index.” (To read the report, search GLAAD and Social Media Safety Index.) The report’s sad conclusion is that the big five players in social media — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok — are not safe for LGBTQ+ folks and are riddled with online hate and harassment. GLAAD used surveys conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in its “Online Hate and Harassment Report: The American Experience 2021.” The ADL surveyed 2,251 people and found that 64 percent of LGBTQ+ folks experienced online hate and harassment. It was the highest percentage for any demographic category. The next highest were Muslims (46 percent), Jews (35 percent), Blacks (33 ), Asian Americans and Latinx (both 31 percent).
Here are two examples of hate speech that LGBTQ+ people see: “Homophobia does not exist. It is a made-up word designed to make heterosexuals feel guilty about being normal.” This post ran with a picture of a white family with two kids on the “Straight Pride World Wide” Facebook page. A meme on Instagram: “Trans Women are Men; Trans Men are Women; Non-Binary is Fake Sh-t; Trans Rights are Not My F---ing Problem.” It went on to warn: “If you are a n---er, k-ke, LGBTHIV+ supporter, feminist, politically correct, globalist and communist ... this page is not for you.” The GLAAD report called on platforms to “act immediately to improve social-media safety for LGBTQ+ people and for other historically marginalized groups. The safety of LGBTQ+ people on social media platforms is an urgent public safety issue.” There are individual recommendations for each platform regarding disinformation and misinformation. These include third-party fact-checking, improving the process of user reporting, bringing transparency to the system of enforcement, using qualified human moderators and diversifying the workplace, to name a few. Of course, monetization is a key factor in whether and how the online media platforms address the issues of online hate and harassment. “Tech companies show an incredible ability to adapt their algorithms to boost engagement and profits,” the report quotes Ina Fried, of Axios, as saying. “They need to devote similar energy to creating algorithms that minimize hate and harassment — for their sake and for society’s.” We are not safe until all of us are safe."

Hospitality workers begin ‘Freedom Ride’ to D.C. to protest restrictive voting laws
By C. Isaiah Smalls II

If there’s one thing that Maria Sanchez learned about American politics in the 20 years since she came from Cuba, it’s that the people have a voice. Exercising that freedom led her and her 9-year-old grandson Adonis to UNITE HERE Local 355’s Miami Gardens office on Thursday morning for a two-day bus trip to Washington, D.C., in support of legislation that will protect voting rights. “I want to instill in him at a young age how important it is to protect your right to vote,” Sanchez said through a translator. The pair were among the more than 30 UNITE HERE 355 hospitality workers and allies traveling to D.C. as part of the “Freedom Ride for Voting Rights,” a nationwide effort organized by the union and Black Voters Matter. On Saturday, about 1,500 workers from across the country will march to the National Mall to protest laws that restrict ballot access. For UNITE HERE 355, which has a primarily Black and Latinx membership, the journey is particularly important because of Florida’s recent voting law changes that critics say will disproportionately affect minorities.
“We live in a country where voting should be easy,” said Kandiz Lamb, the vice president of UNITE HERE 355. “Voting should be encouraged, not pulled away from people.” The demonstration has already drawn comparisons to the 1961 Freedom Rides in which a diverse coalition of civil rights activists rode buses from D.C. to the South to advocate for desegregated bus terminals. That comparison somewhat troubles Duane Thwaites, only because it signals little has changed in 60 years. “We as a country, as a nation, as a people have gone through this for so many years,” said Thwaites, a concession stand manager. “That’s kind of disappointing, [but] I think it’s good that we’re still fighting and we haven’t been discouraged.” As of Monday, 21 states have enacted laws that will make voting more difficult, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked the extensive voting rights bill known as the For the People Act, which Democrats backed to counter the legislation passed in GOP-led states including Florida. The bill included mandates to automatically register voters, ban gerrymandering and require sitting presidents to release their tax returns. Despite the bill’s defeat, Lamb still held hope for some type election reform. She had helped canvass in the January 2021 Georgia Senate runoff that turned the state blue, an effort many people — herself included — initially deemed impossible. To stop now, she said, would offend those who came before her.
“For many many years, our ancestors have fought really, really hard to get us to where we’re at,” Lamb said, “and we refuse to let these politicians take us backwards.” A similar sentiment was echoed by Marie Gilles and 9-year-old Blessing Decius, who, dressed in an oversized red shirt with “Freedom Ride for Voting Rights” inscribed on the front, carried a picture she had drawn of the bus. Gilles had brought along Blessing so that her granddaughter could learn “everything about the right to vote.” “When Grandma dies, she’s supposed to replace Grandma,” Gilles said just before leading Blessing onto the bus. Asked why she had the illustration, Blessing replied: “Because I’m fighting for freedom.”
UNITE HERE 355, a primarily Black and Latinx hospitality workers union, will join more than 1,500 of their peers in Washington D.C. to protest voting law restrictions."

Living and dying on the street, across from a hospital: How to better help the homeless
By Sabrina Hennecke

She was sitting at a bus stop. Wrapped in three layers of clothes, you might make nothing of her at first — until you remember that it’s May, in Miami. Baking in the heat, she had been waiting there for two days, alone, so disoriented that she couldn’t tell us her name. No bus was going to help her. What she really needed was just across the street: a hospital. Our team of medical students from Miami Street Medicine, a student-run organization, found her while conducting a weekly street run to provide medical aid to Miami’s homeless population. Unaware of her surroundings, through fluid filled lungs, she was able to muster a whisper, “Help me.” A few hours after we moved her, her lungs failed entirely and she was placed on a ventilator. Later, we learned that she had been hospitalized just one week before. It was obvious she did not have mental capacity to care for herself before this began. Yet, somehow, she was discharged back onto the streets, prematurely and without a plan, only to sit across from the hospital — waiting, not for a bus, but to slowly die.
Who is responsible? Homelessness is a health crisis. Upwards of 46,500 people experiencing homelessness die each year in the United States, and this number is climbing. Life expectancy for people on the streets is two to three decades shorter than national averages. Chronic diseases and disabilities are exacerbated by life on the street. Deinstitutionalization, a failed policy of the 1980s that closed mental health institutions, has driven many with mental health issues into homelessness.
Stories like this one are not uncommon. You might think it’s the fault of a simple missed line in a chart, but you can speak to any number of hospital emergency or trauma doctors and hear the same story. No one wants to take responsibility for these individuals, so they are passed along. The net result of this so-called help is considerable harm. The pronouns and details may change, but the outcomes do not. Patient abandonment — discharging patients prematurely without adequate planning — is a form of medical malpractice. The Florida Board of Health has a Discharge Planning Guide. Medicare beneficiaries are also actively protected by mandated discharge plans. The laws exist, the resources exist, but if this Miami case shows us anything, the follow-through does not. The issues of homelessness evolve, but its roots are historic and racist. While America’s black population makes up 13 percent of the public, they are estimated to make up 39 percent of our homeless population. Slavery, Jim Crow laws, redlining — in each phase of U.S. history, our policies and system have deprived minorities of socioeconomic opportunities. Black and Latinx Americans make up a disproportionate fraction of those living in deep poverty, a strong predictor of homelessness. In 1988, the Pottinger Agreement arose out of an ACLU case. It gave Miami’s homeless people basic rights and protected them from arrest or unwarranted seizure of property, based on the idea that life-sustaining activities such as being in a park after hours or sleeping in vehicles were unavoidable when homeless. This agreement was terminated in 2019. Across the nation, criminalization of homelessness continues to be a major violation of basic human rights. Legislation that outlaws life-sustaining acts include street sweeps in which homeless people have property confiscated and are forced to leave an area. They solve nothing, but allow cities such as Miami to ignore the underlying problem; out of sight, out of mind.
COVID-19 only made matters worse. As housing insecurity sky rockets across the country, stay-at-home orders, park closures, and nighttime curfews gave more credence to those who sought to criminalize homelessness. Bridging the gaps Street medicine is the practice of bridging the barriers and gaps in care seen in homeless populations. It brings medicine to the streets and connects people to the resources they need. There are street medicine teams across the country, like this student-run one in Miami. They serve a vital role as a stop-gap, catching those that fall through the cracks in our system. We should not need them. Homeless populations have always faced indefensible oppression. Although many aid organizations exist, they still find themselves without much voice. Who will advocate for the people experiencing homelessness? The Miami Coalition to Advance Racial Equity is a multiracial coalition of experts, organizations and people with lived experience being homeless. It is forming with the mission of ending chronic homelessness through the view of a racial equity lens, providing advocacy and a voice. Coalitions like this have emerged countrywide. We need more of them. We also need more safety net hospitals to provide comprehensive healthcare to individuals regardless of income, housing or insurance status. We need to set higher expectations for these hospitals, demanding they keep to their mission and take care of indigent populations. Today, the woman from the bus stop is stable. She is breathing on her own; however, she won’t be discharged until she has a safe place to go, with someone to care for her. Imagine if that had happened from the start. She might never have come so close to dying on the street, across from a hospital."

Florida still is not protecting people in prisons, communities from COVID-19 surge
By Amanda Klonsky and Neal Marquez

As Florida sees another spike in COVID-19 cases, driven by the even-more-contagious delta variant, it’s important that all government agencies take steps to protect all Floridians. Instead, the Florida Department of Corrections is acting as if the pandemic is over, posing a grave danger to people in prisons and surrounding communities. Right now, Florida has the highest rate of new COVID-19 infections of any state. Cases are up by almost 23% in the past two weeks, and deaths are up by a shocking 83%. But you wouldn’t know it from the actions of the Florida Department of Corrections, which appears to believe the pandemic is over even as hospitalizations across the state are on the rise. The agency has declared a return to “normal, non-emergency operations.” Masks are now optional for corrections staff, visitors and people incarcerated in state prisons, despite CDC guidance that people continue to wear masks in correctional facilities. DOC has not updated public data on COVID transmission and deaths for nearly two months. People incarcerated in Florida prisons already have paid a high price for the agency’s failures throughout the pandemic. Our analysis of deaths in Florida prisons reveals that, between 2019 and 2020, the life expectancy for incarcerated people in Florida dropped by four years, with the brunt of the deaths occurring in people aged 55 and older. This is considerably larger than the already catastrophic 18-month decline in life expectancy across the United States, reported by the CDC recently, which itself represents the largest such decline since World War II. The striking difference in years lost that we identified between free and incarcerated Americans highlights the need for increased health protections for people in jails and prisons, who often do not have access to basic hygiene supplies, such as soap or masks, and cannot practice social distancing while crowded behind bars. It is also a reflection of the dangerous and inhumane conditions faced by more than 1.7 million people — most of whom are Black and Latinx — in American prisons.
At least 2,700 people have died from COVID-19 in state and federal prisons so far. The ongoing catastrophe in Florida prisons is no surprise to advocates and public health experts: Since the early days of the pandemic, medical experts have urged prison officials to reduce the number of people in prison, pointing out that many could be safely released and that meaningfully reducing the incarcerated population was the most effective way to reduce viral spread and create the possibility of social distancing inside. In response, Florida officials claimed their hands were tied. To make matters worse, vaccination rates among incarcerated people and prison workers are almost certainly still woefully inadequate to protect those who live and work behind prison walls. The Department of Corrections is in the minority of state systems not publicly reporting its vaccination rates for those incarcerated or employed. A recent media inquiry estimated that around 40% of incarcerated people nationally are vaccinated. To our knowledge, no estimate for staff vaccination rates exists, but an early survey of FLDOC corrections staff indicated that more than half said that they would not get the vaccine. If correct, this is a far cry from the White House’s target vaccination rate of 70% for the country as a whole. The delta variant is even more contagious than previous strains of COVID-19, and unvaccinated people who work in prisons carry the infectious virus into the prisons and back home to their families and communities each day. The largely unvaccinated people who live and work in Florida prisons are likely once again to become a primary source of viral spread in their communities, not to mention a possible source of new strains.
The Florida DOC was regularly updating COVID-19 cases and deaths via an online dashboard, but its reporting stopped abruptly on June 2, 2021. The agency’s silence could now be concealing a COVID-19 resurgence in Florida’s state prisons. Department of Corrections officials should immediately resume tracking and reporting COVID cases. Without concerted steps to gain control of COVID-19 in Florida’s prisons — including expanded prison healthcare, mass vaccinations, the resumption of tracking and reporting data and meaningful efforts to reduce the number of people in prison — COVID-19 will remain a deadly threat to people living and working in prisons, as well as to every person who works inside, and to the communities they return to each day. This is not the time for the Florida Department of Corrections to look the other way. The agency’s current practices are negligence and a dereliction of duty not only toward those in its care but also toward the communities surrounding its prisons. Every Floridian should be alarmed."

‘Fuácata’ explores a day in the life of a Cuban-American woman 
By SUZANNAH YOUNG 

In the revival of “¡FUÁCATA! or A Latina’s Guide to Surviving the Universe,” running at Actors’ Playhouse through Sept. 12, audiences can expect nothing less than what the title implies. The Cuban Spanish term fuácata — which means a back-handed slap — is key to understanding the central theme of the show. “We as women think the only way we’re going to survive the universe is getting ready to give a back-handed slap, because that’s the only way people will actually listen to us” Elena María García says. In the one-woman show, the talented writer, actress, producer and director plays over 20 characters — almost all of whom are women — in a comedic yet powerful exploration of a day in the life of a Cuban-American woman. With a strong focus on female empowerment, the show begins as the main character Elena explains the importance of her morning coffee or café — one of life’s necessities in a Cuban household. Without her café, Elena cannot be the “Super Latina” that her family relies on to make sure the day goes smoothly and everything doesn’t fall apart.
“Usually, after that part I get applause from the audience because the average woman goes, ‘Hell, yeah! If I don’t get stuff done nothing happens!’” García says. But Elena is not the only character who draws a strong reaction from diverse audiences. Other standout characters such as Marisol, a girl who has been trafficked, and Sophie, a stereotypical Miami girl, communicate important themes about female struggles, family and love.

Credit: Justin Namon. “Even the character Marisol, who is smuggled into country and sells water on the street corner — she is still empowered by the fact that she has freedom and that she made it to the United States,” García says.
As Elena navigates the turbulence of everyday life in her search for café, she encounters a plethora of strikingly real female characters, all of whom have their unique stories and own ways of getting through the day. “We don’t believe in spoon-feeding the audience; if you catch it, then you catch it,” García says. “But each woman comes up and says her piece and says something that kind of gives you her perspective on life.” The script mixes lovable characters like Sophie with more serious ones such as Lulu, a Puerto_Rican woman who highlights the discrimination and racism present within the Latinx community. That combination of warmth, laughter and serious subjects is undoubtedly what has led to the show’s success and loyal following. Stuart Meltzer; director and coauthor of “¡FUÁCATA!” Credit: Justin Namon. Stuart Meltzer is co-writer of the show and artistic director at Zoetic Stage, which premiered the show in its home at Miami’s Arsht Center. The play premiered there in 2017, then returned in 2018. He’ll now stage it again at Actors’ Playhouse. A longtime friend and professional colleague of García’s, Meltzer recognizes her powerful ability to portray larger-than-life characters while also expressing her seasoned comedic talent. “I knew this show was an opportunity for us to figure out a way in which to encapsulate both that complex sort of comedy that is so much in [her] wheelhouse with those characters that she knows so innately,” Meltzer says. For the two artists, the ability to understand each other’s creative energies in a way that allowed them both to laugh throughout the process was a way to bring a joyful authenticity to the Miami-based show. While Meltzer also recognizes that the show features predominately female characters in its salute to the strength of Latin women, he believes the beauty of the play is that everyone can find it relatable.
“[This show] celebrates everyone in our community: the good, the bad, the ugly and the super funny,” Meltzer says. “There are different tales and different people that we meet [who] are sometimes not very nice or likeable — and that’s OK! It’s not our job to judge them. It’s our job to tell their truths.” And it was that trifecta of comedy, struggle and honesty that inspired David Arisco, artistic director at Actors’ Playhouse, to select “¡FUÁCATA!” as the perfect show to resume live theater for adult audiences at the Miracle Theatre in Coral Gables.

After having originally scheduled the show for the summer of 2020, Arisco saw the importance of picking a reopening show that would resonate with the predominately Hispanic population in Miami, particularly the heavily Cuban-American demographic in Coral Gables. Despite the title and dominance of Latina characters, Arisco wants audiences to know that the show is in English, with some understandable Spanish or Spanglish thrown in. “If [Elena] says something in Spanish, she always translates,” Arisco says. “And that’s why it has a subtitle [‘A Latina’s Guide to Surviving the Universe’], because we’re trying to let people know that that it’s not in Spanish.”
Arisco says that although this production is a slightly unusual for him, as far as dealing with pandemic safety and inviting Meltzer and his production team into the Miracle, he’s ultimately very excited about it. Although this is the theater’s first one-person Latinx show, Arisco believes that doing a Miami-based show at least once a year is a way to introduce diverse audiences to different kinds of talent and subjects. “It’s important for people to know that there’s a venue…that is willing to…tell [stories about] their lives and their struggle and have their people on stage — and also to know that other people who don’t know that story can go to learn about it,” he says. “Storytelling is at the crux of what we do — at the end of the day, it’s about how well you told the story. To be able to have people of all different nationalities and all different cultures sitting in the same theater and laughing at the same thing…that’s what Miami’s all about. That’s what ‘¡FUÁCATA!’ is.” ArtburstMiami.com is a nonprofit source of theater, dance, visual arts, music and performing arts news."

‘The Mix Master’ Leo Vela, a pioneering DJ in bilingual Miami radio, dies at 68
By Howard Cohen

For a generation of bilingual South Florida radio listeners, many won’t forget the sonorous sound of radio DJ Leo Vela as he hosted disco and post-disco dance and salsa blocs of music on stations including Power 96 and Super Q in Miami. For instance, Hollywood musician Bill Gato’s favorite group may be Led Zeppelin, its mighty rock roar far removed from the ol’ Super Q fare. But Gato, currently CEO of Latinx Newswire, remembers, as a kid growing up in Miami with an older sister who was always listening to Super Q and Y-100 in their house, Vela’s “distinctive” voice in 1979.
“He became famous locally in the late ‘70s,” said Gato, 52, who covered radio for the Miami Herald. “His voice was distinctive in that it was both husky and silky and he spoke in Spanglish at times. It was very Miami.”
The Voice And Vela, known alternately as “The Mix Master” and “The Voice” (with all apologies to Frank Sinatra who once had that applied handle), had not lost that fame. Vela was still working on South Florida Spanish-language radio, on WCMQ-FM — Z92 — the Hialeah-based outlet in the Spanish Broadcasting System, at the time of his death Wednesday. Vela died Aug. 25 at his home in Miami at age 68 after battling heart issues, according to Florida Sen. Ileana Garcia. “One of the most iconic voices in Spanish/Spanglish radio,” Garcia said of Vela on Twitter. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of one of the most iconic voices in Spanish/Spanglish Radio - Disco Salsa Merengue Legendary Super Q Radio Personality, Leo Vela passed away yesterday after battling heart issues. Rest In Peace my friend. — Ileana Garcia (@IleanaGarciaUSA) August 26, 2021
The South Florida radio icon had a career that spanned more than five decades, since America’s Bicentennial year, when he was 24. Bilingual Miami radio pioneer Vela helped pioneer bilingual English and Spanish after working in Miami as a musician and nightclub DJ. He transitioned to radio in 1976, first with Disco 96X and later with Super Q, Power 96, Salsa 98 and El Zol in South Florida. Radio personalities often travel the airwaves so Vela also had stints in Texas, Illinois and New York.
With signature catch phrases “Gosa Now” and “La Descarga Continues (the download continues”), Vela became one of the most warmly received voices in Miami radio. “His generosity and genuine persona earned him the adoration of the music industry’s biggest stars and the average man — and especially woman — alike,” his family’s obituary notice read. “We don’t scream,” Vela told the Miami Herald in 1998 when he was hosting “The Download with Leo” program on WRTO La Nueva 98, in his 22nd year as a South Florida radio veteran. “Our music is about a lifestyle. It combines the classics Hispanic-American adults grew up listening to with a balance of today’s accepted adult-appeal hit records.” Vela often had to buck a system that, like contemporary pop English-language stations, forced a tight playlist to feed the corporate mindset. That didn’t sit right with the musically minded voice of the airwaves. When Vela was program director for Miami’s WRTO-FM 98.3 in 2001, he forged a mixed tropical-dance format that featured salsa, pop, merengue, bachata and English-language hits of the day. His mix idea was a gamble. Vela bet on, and promoted, a bilingual dance sound to appeal to traditional tropical listeners as well as younger, Americanized Latinos who had flocked to contemporary English stations like Power 96 at the time, the Miami Herald reported. “Because we’re a Latin station we can only play one genre?” Vela said in an interview with the Herald in 2001. “Miami is a bicultural, bilingual city. Radio to date has not reflected what’s happening on the streets of Miami. We’re losing too many younger Hispanic listeners to mainstream radio.”
Colleagues remember Vela Born in Miami on Nov. 20, 1952, of Cuban and Puerto_Rican ancestry, Vela lay claim to the title of the first Spanish surnamed DJ on mainstream radio in South Florida, according to the Herald. “A legend. A voice. A bigger-than-life soul,” wrote veteran South Florida DJ Jade Alexander on Facebook. Alexander was partnered with Vela on Salsa 98.3 FM’s “La Descarga con Leo y Jade” program. “The man who I listened to as a kid on the one-of-a-kind Super Q. The man who opened up the door to Live Mix parties on the radio in this town. The man who some 25 years later, from the days of me dancing in my bedroom to his broadcasts, would become my radio partner after I saw him at a party and said, ‘Let’s do a ‘morning show in afternoons’ on the newly re-created bilingual radio station that he was in charge of,” Alexander wrote. “As my program director, he took the risk with this girl who’d only been in general market — and we crushed it because he gave, and he gave, and he gave some more. Generous and loyal to a fault. No ego. Pure love. Infectious laughter. Rare kindness.”
Survivors, services Vela’s survivors include his mother Carmen; sons Leo, Carlos and Bryan and daughters Carmen, Angela and Casey; 15 grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren. He was predeceased by his father Leo and his two brothers Orlando and Carlos. A visitation will be held 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 28, including a celebration of life at 3 p.m., at Van Orsdel Kendall Drive Chapel, 11220 N. Kendall Dr. Miami."

Pitbull donates cash to two small businesses for Hispanic Heritage Month 
By Madeleine Marr

Pitbull can always be counted on to give back. The rap superstar helped kick off National Hispanic Heritage Month Wednesday, by surprising two small Latinx businesses with a $5,000 gift each to celebrate their entrepreneurial success.
During a QuickBooks panel discussion moderated by journalist Soledad O’Brien, Pitbull shared his insights on growing your brand, then ended the chat on a happy note.
Pitbull announced he was gifting Natalie and Jamahl Grace, of Virginia based Grace+Love Candle Company, and Mariette Martinez, of MasterYourBusiness.com, an online learning center for bookkeeping and accounting professionals. The Graces, whose company makes clean-burning, luxury candles, posted on Instagram a snippet from the high-wattage forum: “So this happened today,” with brain exploding emojis. Martinez also posted a video of the online chat Thursday on Instagram, saying she was still “on a high” from the experience 24 hours later: “This idea of dreaming in business to create the reality you desire and deserve started seven years ago,” wrote the California resident. “Friends, as #entrepreneurs we are working towards long term, sustainable, success, not overnight success. There’s enough of everything out there, we just need to #ShowUp and do what it takes to #LevelUp.” Martinez ended the post with a lyric from Pitbull’s new song, “I Feel Good:” “It’s only one life, you don’t get two, so live life don’t let it live you.”"

His books on Rosa Parks and MLK were banned. Here’s what this South Florida author did
By Connie Ogle

When South Florida writer Brad Meltzer learned that a Pennsylvania school board had banned his books “I am Rosa Parks” and “I am Martin Luther King, Jr.,” he knew he couldn’t ignore it. “If you’re taking the lessons of Rosa Parks, you have to fight back,” said the creator of the Ordinary People Change the World series, which profiles historic figures including Abraham Lincoln, Frida Kahlo, Helen Keller and Neil Armstrong for kids. The next in the series, “I am Oprah Winfrey,” will be published in October. “I am Rosa Parks” and “I am Martin Luther King, Jr.” — which, like the other books in the series, are illustrated by Christopher Eliopoulos — were two of more than 200 anti-racism books and resources suggested by the Central York School District’s diversity education committee last year. The Central York school board vetoed the entire list. In a clip from a meeting aired by CNN, which reported on student protests of the ban, members referred to the list of reading and educational material as “divisive” and “bad ideas.” Banned are children’s picture books, K-5 books, middle and high school books, videos, webinars, and web links, including a memoir by Pakistani writer and activist Malala Yousafzai; a book by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor; an adaptation of “Hidden Figures,” about Black female mathematicians at NASA; “Sulwe” by actress Lupita Nyong’o, about a little girl who fears her skin is too dark, and CNN’s “Sesame Street Town Hall” about racism. With no change this fall, students, parents and other community members attended a virtual school board meeting last week to debate the ban, which the school board calls a “freeze.” Senior Edha Gupta from Central York High School told CNN that the ban “was a slap in the face.” School board president Jane Johnson did not respond to emails from the Miami Herald before publication.
Meltzer, who is also the author of popular thrillers for adults, comic books and was the host of The History Channel’s “Lost History,” wondered how to respond. Then he learned that two women in the York area, Hannah Shipley and J.J. Sheffer, were calling for book donations so that they could put some of the banned books in Little Free Libraries around York. They created wish lists on amazon.com and bookshop.org where people could purchase the books and have them sent to York (the address is Haybrook Little Free Library, 131 Haybrook Dr., York, PA, 17406). Meltzer immediately boosted the drive on his social media. And books started pouring in. Shipley, a former preschool teacher, was outraged by the ban. “These banned books cover topics like Eleanor Roosevelt, Rachel Carson, Neil deGrasse Tyson,” she said. “The ban hits every marginalized group: Black, Asian American, Muslim, Latinx, Native American, LGBTQ, disability representation, autism representation. Anything not neurotypical, straight and white. This made me upset. I was welcome to read these books to students in private daycare, but a mile and a half away, students were not allowed to read these books in school.”
Now, Shipley’s house is filling up with books; she has 1,200 at the moment, while the Amazon wish list promises a total of 2,200 are on the way so far. That’s too many books for the Little Free Libraries to handle, so Shipley will distribute them at an upcoming rally.
“If the ban holds, I’ll roll up to a playground in a trench coat and hand them out,” she joked. Meltzer praised the efforts of Shipley and Sheffer, saying the Ordinary Heroes series is not meant to be political but to introduce kids to famous historical figures. “You have an all-white school board and nearly every banned book is written by or about a person of color,” he said. “Race is a hard subject, but nothing good comes out of not talking about hard subjects. If we’re saying we can’t discuss race, we’re doing our kids a disservice.” On Monday night, the York school board reversed its ban, telling parents and students, “We have heard you,” according to the York Dispatch. Shipley says she’ll offer the books she has collected to teachers and work to get copies of ‘I am Rosa Parks” into the hands of as many York elementary school children as possible. “I’m just relieved and so thrilled,” said Meltzer, who attended Monday night’s school board meeting virtually to read from his books. “The York community — and their students — left me so inspired, telling stories about why talking about race is so vital. . . . Now the real work begins: distributing all the books to kids.”"

Living near oil and gas wells exposes you to toxic gases. CA study shows just how much
By Katie Camero

A 14-year analysis of air quality data across California revealed residents who live within 2.5 miles of oil and gas wells are exposed to higher levels of toxic gases — such as carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrous oxide — compared to people who live further away. Long-term exposure to this harmful air pollution, which also includes particulate matter and volatile organic compounds, could harm people’s health, causing asthma, cognitive decline, heart disease and preterm birth, among other conditions. At least 2 million Californians live within a mile of an active oil or gas well, according to the Stanford University researchers behind the analysis. However, communities of color, particularly Black and Latinx communities, face the brunt of the harmful exposure because they tend to live closer to oil and gas wells. “If we care about environmental justice and making sure every kid has a chance to be healthy, we should care about this,” study lead author David Gonzalez, who conducted the research as a Ph.D. student in Stanford, said in a news release posted Oct. 12. But the exact effects on the health of residents who live near oil or gas wells remain unknown, according to the study published in September in the journal Science of the Total Environment.
About 38,000 wells that were actively being drilled and 90,000 wells “in production” in California between 2006 and 2019 were included in the study. Researchers created a model that comprised more than a million daily observations from 314 air monitors and combined it with global wind data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although data was from oil and gas wells in California, the researchers say their findings “are likely applicable” to other regions in the U.S. with oil and gas operations. Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota are also leaders in oil and natural gas production. “While it’s not necessarily surprising that drilling and operating oil and gas wells emit air pollutants, knowing the magnitude of the effect improves our broader understanding of who is exposed to what and how to intervene to improve health outcomes,” study senior author Marshall Burke, an associate professor of earth system science at Stanford in California, said in the release.
When oil or gas wells reach 100 barrels of production a day, concentrations of particulate matter — an invisible mixture of dust, dirt, soot, or smoke and other particles — in the air increase by two micrograms per cubic meter about a mile away from the site, the study found.
Separate research published last year found that just one extra microgram per cubic meter of particulate matter raises the risk of dying from COVID-19 by 11%. Particulate matter comes in many sizes, but particles less than 10 micrometers across can get stuck in your lungs and enter your bloodstream when inhaled, potentially causing irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks and decreased lung function, the Environmental Protection Agency says. Ozone was also present within 2.5 miles from oil and gas wells, the researchers found. Inhalation of low amounts of the toxic gas can cause chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and shortness of breath, the EPA says. It could also aggravate chronic respiratory diseases and prevent people from properly fighting respiratory infections like the coronavirus. People typically recover well from short-term exposure to ozone, but long-term exposure can make recovery less certain because it could cause more damaging effects. Children are especially at risk of ozone exposure because their lungs are still developing. “Many of California’s oil fields have been operating for decades. People that live near them have been chronically exposed to higher levels of pollution — and a lot of these wells are located in neighborhoods that are already burdened by pollution,” Gonzalez said. “Our study adds to the evidence that public health policies are needed to reduce residents’ exposure to air pollution from wells.” In September, Los Angeles County supervisors voted to phase out oil and gas drilling and ban new sites, The Associated Press reported, potentially closing more than 1,600 wells. Other California cities are discussing similar interventions in neighborhood drilling regulations, the researchers said.
Wildfire smoke and industrial activities, both complicated by changing wind patterns, could also contribute to elevated levels of air pollution, but the researchers controlled for these factors. “Sometimes the wind is blowing from the well, sometimes it’s not, and we found significantly higher pollution on days when the wind is blowing from the wells,” Gonzalez said. “As a control, we assumed wells that are downwind of the air monitor shouldn’t contribute any pollution — and that is indeed what we saw.”"

Their images tell compelling stories of women around the world, now on display in Miami
By Jesse Lieberman

Maggie Steber has traveled to 71 countries as an award-winning photographer. She has taken photos of a guerrilla war in Zimbabwe. In Haiti, she witnessed the atrocities of the end of the Duvalier regime. And she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her years-long project documenting the world’s youngest face transplant recipient, an 18-year-old girl who underwent the procedure in Cleveland. But the photos that mean the most to her are of her mother, Madje Steber, who was diagnosed with dementia at 80. The daughter of a single mother, Steber took care of her over a nine-year period and documented her mother’s decline through her photography, “Madje Has Dementia.” She died in Steber’s arms in 2009, one week after her 89th birthday.
“I didn’t really have anybody ... I thought this is my last chance to love,” she says. “Photography really saved me. Those photographs are still my greatest treasures.”
The project landed on the cover of National Geographic and a two-page spread inside the magazine. “So my little mama was a cover girl for NatGeo,” she said. “And I am so proud.” Steber will be one of the panelists at the inaugural WOPHA Congress: “Women, Photography, and Feminisms,” co-presented by Women Photographers International Archive (WOPHA) and Pérez Art Museum Miami. The conference, to be held Nov. 18-19 at PAMM and virtually, will bring together women photographers, scholars, curators and artists from more than 15 countries, including Marie Robert, chief curator of photography at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris; Whitney Johnson, vice president of visuals and immersive experiences at National Geographic Partners; and Laylah Amatullah Barrayn, a documentary photographer and co-founder of MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora. In concert with WOPHA, an exhibition of award-winning women’s photography from around the globe, titled, “Female in Focus,” will open Thursday at Green Space Miami, 7200 Biscayne Blvd. The opening is from 7 to 10 p.m. and it will run through Jan. 18, 2022. The exhibition, presented with 1854 Media and the British Journal of Photography, will showcase the works of the winners of the Female in Focus award, launched in 2019 to help correct gender imbalance in photography.
The idea for the Congress was born out of Aldeide Delgado’s desire to create a spot for women photographers that she felt was lacking in Miami. Born in Cuba, Delgado is an art historian and curator with a focus on feminist and Latinx art history. “For women photographers, we didn’t have a place we can connect.” said Delgado, founder and director of Women Photographers International Archive (WOPHA). “When I came to Miami…I noticed we didn’t have a dedicated place for the promotion of photographic arts.”
The Congress, sponsored by the Knight Foundation and others, is free. One of the three keynote speakers will be Roxana Marcoci, senior curator of photography at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. “When I was coming up in photography, there were a lot of women and even before me, powerful and courageous women covering everything from war to local stories, but many of them were on newspapers staffs and so you didn’t really hear about them,” Steber said. “We are now seeing a whole new generation of women photographers from all over the world.” Steber will be part of a five-person panel discussing documentary photography. “I love to encourage people to use their imaginations,” Steber said. “There will be opportunities to brainstorm with people and give them advice and that is just a joyful act for me.”"

The ‘Latinx community’ doesn’t want to be called ‘Latinx.’ Just drop it, progressives
By the Miami Herald Editorial Board 

Dear progressive politicians, pundits and media friends: Stop trying to make the term “Latinx” a thing. Trust us here in Miami, where, Ya tu sabes, we drink cafecitos and parental discipline is usually delivered with a chancleta. You’re like Gretchen Wieners in the movie “Mean Girls” trying to turn “fetch” into the next cool slang. So, we’ll channel our best Regina George to say: Stop trying to make Latinx happen! It’s not going to happen! We’re not the only ones saying that. The so-called “Latinx community” doesn’t even want to be called Latinx. That’s the finding of a new national poll by Bendixen & Amandi International, a Miami-based Democratic firm focusing on Latino — and we mean Latino — outreach. The survey of 800 registered voters of Latin American descent was conducted in mid-November and found that a meager 2% described themselves as Latinx — the gender-neutral term preferred that’s found its way into media reports and political speeches. The term was unpopular no matter the age or political affiliation of respondents.
The majority (68%) preferred “Hispanic” or “Latina/Latino” (21%). In Miami, whenever possible, we advise you call them Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan, Dominican, Argentine etc. And please don’t call Brazilians Hispanic — they speak Portuguese, not Spanish. The poll also found that 40% say “Latinx” bothers or offends them, and 30% are less likely to support a politician or political organization that uses the term to discuss the members of that community.
It’s starting to look like the majority of people using Latinx are well-meaning non-Hispanics like President Joe Biden, who was mocked on social media for pulling a Gretchen Wieners during remarks about COVID-19 vaccinations in June — “It’s awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated as well,” he said. The term also pops up in the occasional news headline — “Latinx students now eligible to apply for Hispanic scholarship,” read one from Kansas. Every time a Democratic politician uses the term, a Republican operative celebrates. It’s just what the GOP needs to make the case that Democrats are too busy being “woke” to worry about the everyday-life concerns of Americans. Of course, Democrats have more to blame than just a word for the inroads Donald Trump made into those communities in South Florida last November. The Democratic Party is struggling to land the right message with voters and has been notoriously absent from the Hispanic community until the eve of elections.
Some activists prefer Latinx because the word “Hispanic” by definition relates to Spain, the main colonizer of Latin America. Many don’t like “Latino” because it’s a masculine term. “Latina” is its feminine form, but Spanish grammar defaults to the masculine plural “Latinos” when referring to a group of people of all genders. We get it. Spanish grammar can be sexist and a foe to gender neutrality — people who want to be called Latinx should be respected. Nouns and most adjectives have a gender in Spanish. Our beloved cafecito is masculine and the feared chancleta (flip-flop) is feminine. That’s the irony of “Latinx” — it’s supposed to be inclusive but erases a crucial part of Latin American identity and language, and replaces it with an English word. The language of Miguel de Cervantes does not fit the demands of the 21st century, but it’s the language many Miamians spoke at home before they learned English; it’s how they communicate with their parents, abuelas, abuelos, tias and tios. “Latinx” has failed to gain buy-in from the people it’s supposed to empower. It’s time to retire it from official use."

Two Florida guys named ’Carlos’ add up to one big ’Whoopsie-daisy!’ on Fox News
By Fabiola Santiago

Oh, America, the battle for Florida’s political soul requires a higher level of comfort with español and Spanish names than you might think. Look what happened to Fox News this week. In the mix, two prominent Hispanics in politics named Carlos, a divided Florida, and Fox News. What could go wrong? Well, a drop down list of names for a graphics-maker to choose from ends in a hilarious case of mistaken identity. This is what viewers saw: Here was Congressman Carlos Gimenez, a Miami Republican and former county mayor, making a Fox & Friends First appearance to talk about Putin, Biden and the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Gimenez, a newbie representative whose star has been rising if gigs at Fox are a measure of GOP influence, sits on the House Homeland Security Committee. But the identification tag underneath the talking congressman read: “Carlos Guillermo Smith (D) Florida State Representative.”
Who’s the other Carlos? Smith couldn’t be farther from Gimenez on the political spectrum. Florida’s first open and proud LGBTQ Latino legislator — a Florida-born, half-Peruvian, half-French Canadian married to a Puerto_Rican who represents part of Orange County — is a progressive who will tell you that on all issues — from the need for higher wages and affordable housing to COVID accountability — he stands “with the people.” So much so that he’s suing Gov. Ron DeSantis over the lack of transparency on COVID-19 data, which he believes is “prolonging the pandemic and the pain and suffering of Floridians.” And then there’s Gimenez, who, basking in his newfound alliance with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, can’t find anything to like about President Biden. This, despite getting a coveted invite to the White House to discuss infrastructure. He voted against the bill without regard to what it represents to Miami-Dade and other Florida counties in desperate need. “I believe in creating jobs and bringing billions of dollars in infrastructure to expand our roads and build public transit in Florida,” Smith said. “Congressman Carlos voted against the infrastructure plan in Congress.” No, GOP-smooching Fox News isn’t likely to invite The Other Carlos any time soon. “This Carlos supports our democracy for all,” said Smith. “Congressman Carlos voted with the insurrectionists to overthrow our democracy. I fought for voting rights [in Florida].” So imagine what a shocker it was for Miami Republicans accustomed to being fed what they want to hear, watching the clip with Smith’s name on it, a replay of a longer appearance by Gimenez. They got a — what-the-heck? — jolt and called the congressman’s Washington office. On his end, Smith learned of his unintended appearance via a humorous text with a screenshot, not from a fellow Democrat, but from a Republican colleague in the Florida Legislature. Good to know that at least some lawmakers are still capable of engaging in bipartisan rapport.
‘I’m the real CGS’ And why not? Gimenez is a conservative Cuban American these days, but in 2016, when it was convenient for reelection purposes in a Democratic-majority county, supported Hillary Clinton. “For those wondering, NO. NO. That was not me on @FoxNews,” Smith tweeted. “NO. I DID NOT vote to overturn @JoeBiden’s election. I’m the real CGS. I’m a Democrat who defends our democracy and fights for freedom and equality for all! I’m definitely not @CarlosGimenezFL.” For those wondering, NO. NO. That was not me on @FoxNews. NO. I DID NOT vote to overturn @JoeBiden’s election. I’m the real CGS. I’m a Democrat who defends our democracy and fights for freedom and equality for all! I’m definitely not @CarlosGimenezFL. ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/BeWwGatPCV — Rep. Carlos G Smith (@CarlosGSmith) December 7, 2021 Retweeted Ana Ceballos, state government reporter for the Miami Herald: “Whoopsie-daisy.” A mistake, the kind all of us humans make, said a source who explained off the record how the mislabeling happened. The full 5:30 a.m. interview ran correctly labeled. But when it was edited down to replay throughout the day and a new graphic was made, a drop down alphabetical menu appeared with a list of names. The employee hit the first “Carlos G,” which turned out to be Carlos Guillermo Smith. “A matter of a clicked wrong button,” he said. Some, including Gimenez’s staff, say the mistake is much ado about nothing. It was brought to Fox’s attention and immediately corrected. “Of all the times the interview was aired throughout the day, this honest mistake happened once and was rectified immediately,” Gimenez said in a statement sent to me via his spokesman. “Mistakes happen.”
Okay, I get the point. But non-Hispanics confusing Hispanics — the largest minority group in the United States — and putting us in one big labeled pot, as the U.S. government does, is far too common to be simple accidents. “It is frustrating because oftentimes the media, and especially Fox News, tends to put all Hispanics in one category and we know our community is not a monolith,” Smith tells me. That monolith mentality keeps us — and has kept us Latinos, Latinx, Hispanics, whatever you want to call us — for far too long in this country, invisible and misunderstood. The two-Carloses episode is proof. But, hey, thanks for the laugh, Fox!"

A guide to viewing children’s books through a lens of racial representation
By Lindsay Pérez Huber 

Ten years ago, I sat down with my then 8-year-old daughter to read a book before bedtime. The book was sort of a modern-day “boy who cried wolf” story, only it was about a little girl named Lucy who had a bad habit of telling lies. In the story, Lucy borrowed her friend Paul’s bike and crashed it. Lucy lied to Paul, telling him “a bandit” jumped in her path and caused the crash. I saw the image and stopped reading. I was stunned. The image on the page was the racist stereotype of the “Mexican bandit” wearing a serape, sombrero and sandals. By training, I am a critical race theorist in education who understands that racism is ingrained into the fabric of our society in general, and in educational institutions in particular. One area of my research is about how people of color experience racial microaggressions, which are often subtle but significant attacks — verbal or nonverbal. They can take on many forms, such as remarks about one’s identity, and occur because of institutionalized racism. Although I am an academic who studies racism, in that moment, as a parent, I felt unsure about how to help my daughter understand what we were seeing in that book. Around the same time, I read an opinion piece by children’s book author Christopher Meyers in The New York Times titled “The Apartheid of Children’s Literature.” It outlined the problem of racial representation in children’s literature. These personal encounters prompted me to investigate the portrayals of people of color in children’s books. I learned that the Cooperative Children’s Book Center (CCBC), a research library based at the University of Wisconsin, has been collecting data on the number of children’s books published in the U.S. authored by and about people of color.The data is disturbing. In 2015 — when I began this research — there were 85 books published in the U.S. that included Latinx characters from the 3,200 children’s books the center received that year. That’s about 2.5% of the total, whereas Latinx kids represent about 1 in 4 school children in the U.S. Since then, there has been an upward trend for all ethnic or racial groups. However, books written by and about people of color remain a very small proportion of books published each year. The most recent CCBC data reports books with Latinx characters were about 6% of the more than 4,000 children’s books the center received in 2019. The lack of representation of communities of color in children’s books is another longstanding problem — one that has persisted since at least the 1920s when renowned sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois first expressed his concerns about anti-Black racism in children’s books. Books can serve as important tools for children to develop their own sense of self and identity. When children of color do not see themselves in the books they read, this sends the message that they and their communities are not important. In a study published in 2020, my colleagues and I used critical race theory to develop a rubric to critically analyze racial representations in children’s books. Drawing from this research, here are five questions to consider when choosing books about people of color:
1. What roles do the characters of color play? It is important to see people of color represented in a wide array of characters to avoid falling into racist tropes and stereotypes. When characters of color are present, it is important to recognize the position they play in the story line. Children should have the opportunity to see characters of color as main characters, central to the stories they read. For example, in Pam Muñoz Ryan’s “Esperanza Rising,” the story follows Esperanza, a young Latina girl whose affluent Mexican family loses everything in a series of tragic events that force her and her mother to migrate North to California, where they become farmworkers. For younger readers, Matthew A. Cherry’s “Hair Love” tells the story of a young African American girl named Zuri, who wants to celebrate a special day with a special hairstyle, which she gets with the help of her father. 2. Does the book contain racial stereotypes? Research has found that dominant perspectives of communities of color are often guided by views that they are culturally deficient. These deficit views often blame people of color for the social inequities they face, such as low educational attainment or poverty. In my view, it is important to identify whether stories about people of color perpetuate or challenge these views. One example of deficit views would be the book with a character that perpetuates the racist stereotype of the Mexican bandit, which I mentioned earlier. Images like those have historically targeted Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. 3. Are characters represented in culturally authentic ways? Culturally authentic stories are accurate portrayals of a particular culture. For example, the book “I’m New Here” by Anne Sibley O’Brien is a story about three young students from Somalia, Guatemala and Korea who immigrate to the U.S. and come to school for the first time, but does not recognize how these students can have different immigration experiences from one another. Language used by and between characters is an important signal for cultural authenticity. Education scholar Carmen Martínez Roldán has found that mock Spanish is used frequently in the best-selling children’s book series “Skippyjon Jones” by Judy Schachner. Mock Spanish, according to Roldán, is the borrowing of selective aspects of Spanish that serve to mock those who speak it, such as phrases like “no problem-o” and “no way Jose.”
4. Do the books include the bigger picture? Effective storytelling about people of color should provide a broader historical, social, political and other context. This gives children the ability to understand how everyday experiences exist within the larger society. For early readers, these contexts are usually subtle clues that can help children better understand a broader issue. For example, in “We Are Water Protectors,” author Carole Lindstrom warns of the effects of environmental pollution through Indigenous perspectives of water as a precious resource to be protected. Context becomes more explicit for older readers in chapter books and books aimed at middle or high school students, like George Takei’s graphic novel “They Called Us Enemy,” which is about his personal experience growing up in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. 5. Who has power and agency in the story? There are many vantage points from which a story can be told. When a book tells a story through the eyes of a character of color, there is a power assigned to the character in the telling of their own story. This strategy gives the character agency to construct the narrative, and to resolve the ending. Juana Martinez-Neal’s “Alma and How She Got Her Name” is a moving story of a little girl who learns the power of her name is connected to the history of her family. One problematic strategy I have seen in books with characters of color is the use of nameless characters. Using general references like “the girl” or “the boy” shifts power and agency away from the character and creates a social distance between the story and the reader, rather than making a humanistic connection. For example, Jairo Buitrago’s “Two White Rabbits” tells an important story of a young girl’s migration north from Mexico with her father. However, there is a missed opportunity for readers to connect with the main character, who is not given a name, and thus to her migration story. One of the most important things parents can do is to engage with their child readers about what they are reading and seeing in books. Helping children to make sense of what they see, challenge ideas and recognize problematic storytelling are critical tools they can use to read the world around them.

Federal trial over Florida’s changes to voting laws begins with focus on registration
By Lawrence Mower 

A federal trial challenging recent changes to Florida’s voting laws began Monday with voting rights groups claiming the laws have made it harder to register voters. During a day of testimony over the video conferencing software Zoom, advocates claimed that one of the lesser-discussed changes to the state’s voting laws has created a chilling effect on both potential voters and those who try to sign them up to vote. The trial is over Senate Bill 90, passed by GOP lawmakers last year at the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis. The legislation targeted the state’s vote-by-mail process and the use of ballot drop boxes, which were the basis of some of former President Donald Trump’s widespread claims of voter fraud. A host of left-leaning groups — including the League of Women Voters of Florida and the NAACP — sued elections supervisors, Secretary of State Laurel Lee and Attorney General Ashley Moody last year over the law, saying the requirements were burdensome for certain groups of voters, including minorities. Senate Bill 90 made mostly administrative changes to the state’s voting laws, but it also:
Limited the use of ballot drop boxes to early voting hours, unless they’re in a supervisor’s office, and required them to be manned at all times. Outlawed the possession of more than two vote-by-mail ballots other than those of immediate family. Reduced the amount of time a vote-by-mail request is in effect, from two general election cycles to one cycle. On Monday, testimony focused on an aspect of the bill that has been given less public attention. The legislation required third-party groups to issue a warning when trying to register voters. The groups now have to tell voters that their registration application might not be turned in before the voter registration deadline or within the required 14 days. And they have to inform potential voters how to register on the Secretary of State’s website and how to determine whether the application has been delivered.
The provisions were a reaction to groups not submitting registration forms in time, lawmakers said.
That warning has had a chilling effect on both potential voters and the people trying to register those voters, said Cecile Scoon, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. One of the league’s activities includes registering voters. Scoon recalled how she was recently trying to register voters at a library. She was on the cusp of registering one man, she said, who was enthusiastic until she got to the warning. The man then made a face and said he would register another time, she said. “He walked away. He did not register,” Scoon said. The required warning has also dampened enthusiasm among the league’s members, with some saying they didn’t want to keep trying to register voters, she said. “They were embarrassed,” Scoon said. “They felt they were having to say things they didn’t believe were true.” The experience was echoed by Esteban Garces, co-executive director of Poder Latinx, a group that seeks to empower their community through the electoral process and community organizing. Garces testified that registering voters was central to its mission, and having to read the script is “negatively impacting our ability to meet our mission.” Potential voters have found the instructions confusing and suspicious. “They just walked away,” Garces said. “They didn’t like what they heard.” Attorneys noted that the organization has had two instances of not submitting voter registration forms on time. Garces said the forms were still submitted before the voter registration deadline, and they fired the person responsible within a week of conducting an internal investigation.
Scoon also testified that the law’s provisions around drop boxes have been broadly interpreted by elections supervisors. She noted that in her hometown of Panama City, Bay County’s elections supervisor removed its drive-up drop box to avoid running afoul of the law. She also said she’s heard supervisors interpret new “no-solicitation zone” rules too broadly, restricting all activity by third-party groups within 150 feet of a polling place. The law prohibits “any activity with the intent to influence, or effect of influencing, a voter,” but it also explicitly states that “solicitation” does not prohibit “nonpartisan assistance” including “giving items to voters.” The trial is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, an Obama-appointed judge who has been a thorn in the side of Republican governors on a variety of legal issues over the years. The trial is expected to last two weeks and involve nearly 30 witnesses. It got off to a slow start on Monday after attorneys spent more than four hours questioning Scoon, the first witness. That prompted Walker to inform lawyers that the trial would go all day Saturday and Sunday as well. The trial is being held virtually because of the recent surge in coronavirus cases. “If we don’t go seven days a week, we will never get through this proceeding,” Walker said. The witnesses are expected to include five Democratic lawmakers, several elections supervisors and Dan Smith, one of three University of Florida professors who were initially barred by the university from testifying against the state. The university eventually relented; a lawsuit against the university by Smith and the other professors is pending in Walker’s courtroom."

Sip passion fruit cocktails under the stars at this chic new pool bar in Miami Beach
By Connie Ogle

Pool bars and Miami go together like — well — pool bars and Miami. This is why we are never sorry to report the opening of a new pool bar, in this case Delirio on Miami Beach. Delirio is the creation of Viajero Hostels, which took over The Stiles Hotel in South Beach last December. Now the owners have opened the South American-inspired Delirio, which comes with plenty of outdoor seating, a funky pool to drink around, a laid-back 1970s vibe and cocktails. A pool, great drinks, a hotel on the property: You might think of it as sort of a Latin American version of The Freehand. “We were elated by the opportunity to create a truly unique space for young tourists and locals that felt original and unexpected,” said Lucho Gonzalez, who with partner Fede Lavagna co-founded Viajero Hostels in 2005. “There are countless Latinx-inspired bars and restaurants in South Florida, so to stand out we unveiled a stylish hangout that incorporates the colors, architecture and vibes of South Beach while still bringing a taste of our Colombian and Uruguayan roots.”
The indoor bar features palm tree wallpaper, while the retro pool deck, illuminated by hanging lights, is filled with lounging beds and a pool design highlighted by geometric shapes.
Anywhere young guests and pool bars come together in Miami, craft cocktails are sure to follow. It’s no different at Delirio. Tropical creations reign. The bar’s signature cocktail, El Viajero, mixes Bacardi rum, passion fruit, lime juice and rosemary syrup, while the Sobe Caliente is a spicy blend of tequila, lime, muddled jalapeños, agave and Tajin. Drinkers with a sweet tooth can try Crazy Pineapple, with rum, grapefruit and pineapple juice, coconut cream, real pineapple chunks and lime. The drinks run around $14 and can also be served in a pitcher or punch bowl ($60 and $90). A menu of Caribbean-inspired plates includes jerk wings in several flavors; coconut shrimp or ceviche. You can also order a fried chicken sandwich or the Viajero burger. There are also vegetarian options like the impossible burger or the mango salad."

They were bypassed by #MiamiTech’s boom. So here’s what Black entrepreneurs did
By Kalia Richardson 

Black hair care is often overlooked by venture capitalists, a world that remains distant from Black and Brown communities. Only 2% of venture capitalists are Black men and only 1% are Black women. Miami entrepreneur Rishielle Giscombe is undeterred. In an effort to transform hair care in the South Florida tech space, Giscombe applied her interest and expertise in beauty to develop an app that connects stylists with clients. Her business, Glamo, was born out of providing rides to elderly people in 2015 and treating them free trims, blowouts and crochet braids once they arrived home. As Giscombe began to build clientele, she put flyers on gas station windows, left them in beauty supply stores, and handed them out at Coral Square mall. Giscombe even went door to door. As a Black, female immigrant from Jamaica, Giscombe said she can be easily left out in the tech space, but doesn’t allow what she calls tech’s “cookie-cutter” tendencies to dissuade her drive to excel. “I want people to judge me based on my determination to actually have a successful company,” she told The Miami Herald. “That’s why I am where I am today.”
Glamo launched in 2018 and connects consumers with more than 100 nail, hair and makeup stylists in the South Florida area. Glamo receives a fee every time an appointment is booked through the app.
Amid the #MiamiTech wave that has swept over the city in the past year, Black entrepreneurs are molding their own avenues of success. Their aims are the same as that of other tech founders — but with greater urgency: to create generational wealth while uplifting and empowering Black and Brown communities through innovation. “I am leaning on the resources that I already have, and the relationships and resources that I do know work,” said Dani Spikes, founder of BeLoved Box, a monthly subscription self-care and beauty box company, which has now reached seven-figure sales numbers since its founding in 2016. Spikes said the new Miami tech boom has not lived up to its diversity ideals. Indeed, the list of the top 40 venture capital deals in Miami for 2021 through Aug. 3 consists of just one Black-founded startup: Toast Distillers, one of the nation’s few Black-owned distilleries best known for its Toast Vodka brand, which received less than $100,000 in an angel investment, according to Pitchbook.
“I have been over-mentored and under-funded,” Spikes said. ‘I’m not seeing diversity’ For eight years, Felecia Hatcher has been at the forefront of bringing Black tech workers into the broader Miami tech fold. Prior to her co-founding The Center for Black Innovation (initially called Code Fever) in 2013, virtually no Black tech community existed in South Florida. “There was no plan for Black entrepreneurs,” Hatcher said. “There was no plan for building a Black tech community, and so we created that.” Hatcher says some major corporations even asked her to change the name of Blacktech Week, another initiative she’d pioneered, to receive sponsorship funding. Venture capitalists would attend the expo so they could say that they’d participated in a diversity event and make false promises to Black founders, ignoring their calls and investment meetings, she said. “Miami is diverse, but it’s still a very racist city,” said Hatcher, now CEO of Black Ambition, a funding initiative for Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.
Black founders, Hatcher continued, are not experiencing the uptick in investment seen in other parts of the tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, tech spaces like the Center for Black Innovation in Overtown are underutilized by the larger tech community. “When you say diversity, what do you actually mean by that?” she asked, referring to Miami’ city government initiatives. “Because I’m not seeing diversity in location, I’m not seeing diversity in access, I’m not seeing diversity in your outreach, I’m not seeing diversity in your programming.” The City of Miami has provided $500,000 in funding to support programming at the Center for Black Innovation and hosted an innovation tour with the ”5000 Role Models of Excellence” project in October to educate students on cryptocurrency, according to the city’s communications director, Soledad Cedro. “As our Miami pursues becoming the ‘capital of capital’ it is crucial that we create robust pathways for Black and Brown founders to be central to the narrative of what we are building together,” Mayor Francis Suarez said in an email. “The ethos of our movement is community first and that begins by ensuring every one of our residents is at the opportunity table.” Aiding marginalized communities Doris Jean Pierre founded AccessBridge in 2018 after facing rejection in the field of healthcare administration because she had little experience. AccessBridge aims to prepare diverse talent for the workforce through career exploration, leadership development and connecting participants with internships. “Healthcare organizations were saying that the reason why they don’t have a diverse workforce is because they don’t know where to find Black and Brown talent,” said Jean Pierre, 27. “So, for me, it’s, ‘Here we are. You come to us’.”
Jean Pierre wants to see more accelerator programs and mentorship services that not only provide resources but also make adequate funding accessible for Black start-up founders. “They say they welcome Black and Brown founders, yet you are more likely to get into a program where there’s no funding than a program where they would give you funding,” she said. BootUp founder Chandler Malone moved to Miami from Tulsa, Oklahoma, in search of capital and talent. BootUp helps tech boot camps and vocational training programs find and place candidates, making it easier for people without experience to break into the tech space.
Although Boot Up, which launched in June, doesn’t have a diversity and inclusion focus, Malone said the pipeline to acquiring software engineering or digital marketing skills is more accessible than going to college, with 78% of its candidates from underrepresented communities. Candidates don’t pay for enrolling in a program, he said, and are only charged once they’ve landed a job with a specific income threshold. “What we would love to do is see folks who have historically been underrepresented in tech leverage us as a way to break into tech in a faster, lower cost, higher fidelity way,” said Malone, 27. His company aids about 600 candidates a week, ranging from single parents working minimum wage jobs to young immigrants who cannot make the financial commitment to attend college. They’ve landed jobs at Tesla, Uber, Facebook and Google. As an angel investor and venture partner at Atento Capital, a Tulsa-based investment fund, Malone said he gains fulfillment from investing in Black founders. He recognizes the benefits of Black networks, as well as fostering the seeds for younger generations who can bring unique value to the tech space. ”I really want to help people improve quality of life through getting into tech,” Malone said, “and, like a secret close to heart, would love to see more Black folks getting into tech and what that could do for us.” Creating equitable pathways Derick Pearson, president and executive director for the Center for Black Innovation, wants to ensure Black tech founders in or moving to Miami can participate in the growing tech economy, rather than transplant the barriers that exist in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York. Pearson said he has continued to pivot to meet the needs of the Black communities. He co-founded Tribe, a co-working space in Overtown that connects minority-led startup founders with opportunities and capital, as well as helped launch one of the first groups to take part in the Ecosystem Builders Fellowship program in June, where entrepreneurs raised more than $400,000 for their businesses.
Black people have influenced everything from culture to purchasing power, Pearson said. By depriving people of livable wages and resources to build wealth and prosperity, you create a cancer throughout the nation, he said. In the long term, he wants the Center for Black Innovation to become irrelevant in a future city where #MiamiTech will mean that innovation deserts are extinct and equitable pathways to capital exist for Black entrepreneurs and communities. “If you want to have a more resilient, more ruthless and responsive civilization in the United States, you need to make sure that all parties that make up the body of American citizens, or active participants, are looked after,” Pearson said. “They’re not disenfranchised, they’re not marginalized, they’re not quieted, they’re not oppressed, and they’re active.”"

Think smart sleeping is a good investment? SoftBank does in its new Miami tech initiative
By Rob Wile

Miami’s active tech scene has gone to sleep. For an investment, that is. SoftBank says it has picked a third company to receive funds via the $100 million Miami investment initiative it announced in January. The new recipient is Eight Sleep, a high-performance sleep company that sells tech-enabled, temperature-controlled mattresses. Its executives, and soon other employees, are moving from New York to the Magic City. “We spend a third of our life on a mattress, which is otherwise just a piece of foam,” Marcelo Claure, SoftBank International Group CEO, told the Miami Herald at the venture giant’s offices in Brickell. “So someone who is studying what it takes to get a good night’s sleep ... that data and technology is so valuable.” Founded in 2014, Eight Sleep has already raised more than $75 million for its smart mattresses, which automatically adjust temperature according to a user’s body characteristics and sleeping habits. They’ve been rated the top “smart” mattress, the top mattress for athletes, and the top cooling mattress for hot sleepers by SleepFoundation.org, a sleep resource site. They also connect to phones to provide a sleep report and tips for getting a better slumber. Mattresses start at $2,495, or $70 a month. To make the investment, whose sum was not disclosed, SoftBank is tapping its $100 million Opportunity Fund, which is dedicated to supporting minority founders — in this case, Eight Sleep’s Alexandra Zatarain, a Latina of Mexican descent. Zatarain and her husband, Eight Sleep CEO Matteo Franceschetti, met in Miami and have visited “hundreds” of times. Zatarain also attended a University of Miami communications program for a year.
The company plans to announce additional “actions” soon that would further cement the company in Miami, Zatarain said.
“Having lived here for a year and being familiar with the culture, we feel it’s important to connect ourselves, beyond just people who want to move here, and give people here an opportunity to join our team and have amazing jobs,” Zatarain said. Eight Sleep follows Miami-based startups Quiknode, a blockchain applications support firm, and cybersecurity company Lumu, in receiving backing via SoftBank’s Miami initiative. Since the first two investments were announced, Quiknode was selected for the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator, while Lumu disclosed it had accepted a $7.5 million investment round led by SoftBank. Claure said SoftBank hopes to announce at least one new investment a month via the Miami initiative. He said the initiative had already received interest from 600 startups. Turning away a company is difficult, he said, but aside having a Miami connection, SoftBank’s standard criteria is that a target company must be capable of disrupting the industry.
“We’re long term holders in companies,” he said. “We’re the only company that can write a $1 million check or a $10 billion check. We don’t just invest in businesses that make money, but ones that can massively disrupt work, play and life. We’re not made for everybody.”
Claure said the Opportunity Fund itself is moving to Miami to be run alongside SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America fund. It is among the largest funds in the world dedicated to supporting Black, Latinx, and Native American founders, and has invested in nearly 30 companies since its creation last year. “I was frustrated that most of our investments basically went to U.S. and basically to white males, Indians, and Chinese, and very little going to Black or Hispanic entrepreneurs,” Claure said. Studies and experience show that those entrepreneurs tend to identify with investors of color — and vice-versa, he said. “It’s much easier, when you’re developing a product for Blacks or Hispanics to have someone who understands the value proposition a little bit better,” Claure said. In the next 30 days, SoftBank plans to announce the opening of its own, larger office in Miami. The space, as much as 100,000 square feet, would house executives and employees for both the Opportunity Fund and Claure’s SoftBank International Group, which will also being consolidated in Miami, Claure said. He jokes that while he’s “not too happy” about having more competition from other venture capitalists, like Founders Fund, that are now moving into Miami. “You haven’t seen anything else like this in the world, it’s like a gold rush,” he said. “This is now where everyone wants to come. We want to make sure we’re creating and providing the capital, talent and resources these companies need to keep going and be successful.”"

Workers who legally use cannabis can still lose their jobs 
By SOPHIE QUINTON 

Thirty-seven states now allow adults to use marijuana medically, recreationally or both. But in most of those states, people can be fired or denied a job for using cannabis in their free time. Cannabis legalization advocates want states to do more to protect workers. They note that workplace drug tests don't measure whether someone is high at the time of the test, just whether they've used recently. And they say workplace drug testing is an equity issue, as tests are more common in blue-collar jobs and disproportionately affect non-White workers. But certain employers are required to test for marijuana under federal law—the federal government classifies marijuana as a dangerous drug akin to heroin—and others want to make sure they don't employ drug users who could threaten workplace safety. So far, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have banned employers from discriminating against workers who use marijuana for medical reasons. New Jersey and New York ban employers from discriminating against workers who legally use marijuana medically or recreationally. And Nevada bans employers from refusing to hire someone solely because they fail a marijuana test. The laws generally make exceptions for certain employers and occupations. But bills have stumbled elsewhere because of opposition from business groups and disagreements over how to measure marijuana intoxication. A bill filed in Washington state this session already has been tabled. A California bill faces an uphill battle. And, in light of opposition, a Colorado bill will be softened to studying the issue.
The initial version of the Colorado bill would have affirmed the right of medical marijuana patients to use cannabis products at work and would have prevented employers from firing or refusing to hire workers who use marijuana off the job. It was always going to be a heavy lift: The bill raised legal questions—particularly about the medical marijuana provisions—since Colorado's 2012 ballot measure that legalized pot sales affirmed employers' right to restrict worker marijuana use. Within two weeks of filing the bill in early February, state Rep. Edie Hooton, a Democrat, told Stateline she planned to scrap it. Instead, she'll propose that state officials convene employers, medical cannabis users and prescribers to study the workplace testing issue. ""I knew it was going to change,"" Hooton said of her initial bill, which she said was modeled on draft legislation backed by medical cannabis advocates in other states. ""I don't want to be in opposition with organized labor or employers, like the Chamber of Commerce or organized business interests."" Several employer groups had opposed Hooton's initial bill, including the state Chamber of Commerce and the Colorado Mining Association. The Colorado Mining Association has consistently opposed bills that would prevent employers from maintaining a drug-free workplace, said association President Stan Dempsey.
Drug use can create workplace safety issues, he said. ""Going back many, many years, companies have had employees who have either been hurt or killed, unfortunately, with marijuana in their systems."" Colorado state Sen. Chris Holbert, a Republican who last year backed a law that allows school personnel to administer medical cannabis to children while they're in school, said employers should be able to drug test workers for marijuana if they choose. He emphasized that when Colorado voters legalized pot, they wrote that authority into the state constitution. But employers should make an informed decision, he added. ""What I really encourage employers to understand is, if they're testing for drug use, then what is the test or those tests looking for?"" If employers are worried about someone coming to work high, he said, they should be asking whether workplace drug tests measure that—and whether, for instance, they also penalize employees for using non-psychoactive cannabis products, such as a hemp extract. To test, or not to test? Federal contractors and businesses that employ certain regulated professionals such as airline pilots and school bus drivers must drug test workers for marijuana. Other employers have a choice. They might decide to drug test workers as part of a job application, randomly, after an accident, if they suspect a worker is intoxicated, or in all four situations. Today most of the nation's largest private-sector companies have some sort of drug testing program, said Barry Sample, senior science consultant for employer solutions at Quest Diagnostics, a global laboratory company that processes workplace drug tests for employers. Of the tests Quest Diagnostics processes that aren't federally required, Sample said, roughly three-quarters are part of job applications. Quest Diagnostics' data suggests that drug testing for marijuana is becoming less common, with the number of urine tests to screen for the drug declining by 5% between 2015 and 2020.
Amazon, the nation's second-largest private employer after Walmart, announced plans last summer to stop requiring job candidates to pass a marijuana drug test (the company will still test at other times, such as after workplace accidents). Amazon executives have said that the growing number of states legalizing marijuana, equity concerns and the tight labor market all factored into their decision. ""We've found that eliminating pre-employment testing for cannabis allows us to expand our applicant pool,"" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of human resources, said in a January memo posted online. Dropping marijuana tests allows employers to consider hiring and retaining the small but growing share of applicants who use the drug. Nationwide, 4.4% of workers failed tests Quest Diagnostics processed in 2020, up from 3.5% in 2012. The rate was slightly higher, 4.8%, in states that allow adults to buy recreational marijuana. ""It's not surprising that in our testing we're seeing year-over-year increases in marijuana positivity,"" Sample said. ""Clearly, societal views on marijuana use are evolving."" Companies' ongoing struggles to recruit and retain workers may encourage more of them to drop marijuana tests, said Melissa Moore, director of civil systems reform at the Drug Policy Alliance, a national nonprofit that advocates for ending punitive drug laws. ""During the labor crunch right now, some employers are taking a look at: Is this something that's not actually accomplishing the goal of workplace safety?"" she said. Employers may be unnecessarily blocking people from certain positions, Moore said. She also noted that a 2013 Yale School of Medicine study found that Black and Hispanic workers were more likely than White workers to be employed by a workplace that requires drug testing. ""Let's make sure we're not putting up artificial roadblocks that end up impacting, especially, Black and Latinx employees,"" she said.
Safety first Legislative debates over whether to protect workers who legally use cannabis often get bogged down in debates over workplace safety and how to measure cannabis intoxication. It's a problem with no solution. There's no Breathalyzer for marijuana, and no national legal limit for whether someone has an unsafe level of psychoactive cannabis compounds in their body. ""No drug test, in urine, oral fluid or hair, measures impairment,"" Sample said. ""Just to set the record straight. None of these tests can tell you how much, how frequently, whether or not someone's impaired. It just tells you that you have used it."" Cannabis legalization advocates point out that cannabis compounds can linger in the body for weeks, if not months. That makes failing a marijuana drug test akin to failing a sobriety test because you had a glass of wine two weeks ago, said Moore, of the Drug Policy Alliance. Meanwhile, employer groups say business owners should be able to maintain a drug-free workplace if they want. The Colorado Restaurant Association's primary concern with Hooton's original bill was language allowing employees to use medical marijuana at work, said Mollie Steinemann, manager of government affairs for the association, in a phone interview. Restaurants involve tight working spaces and hazards from knives to open flames and deep fryers, she said. Allowing workers to use intoxicating substances on the job could lead to accidents and potentially the loss of an establishment's liquor license. The same goes for other intoxicating substances, including prescription drugs and alcohol, Steinemann added in an email to Stateline. ""What we're concerned about is making it so that all employees, regardless of position, or regardless of potential risk within a restaurant, would just be allowed to use medical marijuana,"" Steinemann said. Sample, of Quest Diagnostics, argued that although workplace marijuana tests don't measure impairment, they may nevertheless flag behavior that could predispose someone to accidents at work. Workers are more likely to fail marijuana tests after a workplace incident than when they're applying for a job, he said.
""Correlation doesn't always equal causation, and I'm not trying to say it does in this case,"" Sample said. ""But it certainly appears that there may be some association."" Worker protection laws that have been successful in other states typically include exemptions for certain jobs. Nevada's 2019 law that stops employers from discriminating based on a pre-employment marijuana test, for instance, exempts candidates subject to federal drug testing and who, in the employer's view, are applying for jobs that could ""adversely affect the safety of others."" Such exemptions led groups that previously opposed the legislation, such as the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce and the Nevada Trucking Association, to take a neutral stance on it instead. Hooton, the Colorado state lawmaker, said past Colorado bills that aimed to protect cannabis users at work failed because sponsors didn't do enough to get employers, unions and other interest groups on board. ""You can't have a bill that significantly impacts employers without having them be central to the legislation,"" she said—unless they're doing something egregious. ""This is absolutely nothing like that. This is: We need employers' feedback. We need their participation."""

Women in commercial real estate earn more than men in South Florida. Here’s why
By Rebecca San Juan

In most professions, men still earn significantly more than women. But not so in the local commercial real estate scene. In South Florida, white women are paid on average a salary of $148,582 per year, while women of color earn an average of $91,230 annually, according to a 2020 study by the Kansas-headquartered Commercial Real Estate Women Network. Men earn an average $53,562 per year, about 59% less than white women and 42% less than women of color.
The organization surveyed 51 brokers, developers, financiers, and lawyers involved in commercial real estate in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Naples, Marco Island, and Pompano Beach during the first quarter of 2020. The study, published in September, is part of a global survey of 2,930 people, and compares annual salaries versus commission-based positions. In South Florida, 79% of women and 50% of men earn a salary. Globally, women in commercial real estate earn $90,754 per year versus $101,025 per year for men, a gender pay gap of 10.2%.
Why might South Florida be different? Diversity, said Laura Lewis, the chief marketing officer for the CREW Network. Fifty-six percent of those surveyed in South Florida were people of color — Asian, Black, Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, Native Hawaiian or mixed race — compared to 13% represented in the global data. “Before COVID, there seemed to be plenty of commercial real estate jobs,” Lewis said. “When more diverse people work in that industry and in leadership positions, we see more diverse people entering these fields. Essentially, if you see it, then you can be it.”
It doesn’t hurt that the powerhouse firm of Blanca Commercial Real Estate is owned by a woman — Tere Blanca — and that women hold key positions in her company (Danet Linares is vice chairperson), and others in the region, including Barbara Libatore Black, managing director at JLL and Donna Abood at Avison and Young, to name but a few.
Still, when it comes to commission and bonus-only positions, South Florida women suffer. White women earn on average $82,513 per year and women of color earn $40,717 per year. Men earn on average $353,062 per year — a difference of 77% for white women and 88% for women of color. Overall, all women globally earn an average income of $15,075 per year compared to $43,349 per year for men in commission-only positions, a gap of 65.2%."

Google sued by Black ex-employee over ‘racially biased’ culture 
By MALATHI NAYAK 

Alphabet Inc.’s Google discriminates against Black people, who are “pigeon-holed into dead-end jobs” with low pay and subjected to harassment, a former employee claimed in a lawsuit. April Curley, who was hired by the technology giant as a University Programs Specialist in its New York office in 2014, said in the complaint that she was fired in 2020 after she “vocally opposed and called for reform of the barriers and double standards Google imposed on Black employees and applicants.” Curley is Black. Google, which has shown slow progress in diversifying its workforce in recent years, made a big push to hire more Black employees in 2020, after the police murder of George Floyd sparked worldwide protests in support of racial justice. The company is also facing a suit by another Black employee who accused it in 2017 of hiring minority job seekers with rosy promises and then assigning them jobs with lower pay. “Google’s centralized leadership, which is nearly devoid of Black representation, holds biased and stereotypical views about the abilities and potential of Black professionals,” Curley said in her complaint, filed Friday in federal court in San Jose, California. That’s why “Google hires few Black employees and steers those few Black employees into lower-level roles, pays them less, and denies them advancement and leadership roles because of their race,” she said.
Hiring managers viewed Black candidates as not “Googly” enough and interviewers “hazed” Black candidates and asked them “level-inappropriate questions” to hurt their hiring prospects, Curley said. She is seeking damages for discriminatory employment practices and policies. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Google’s U.S. workforce is just more than 50% White, 42% Asian, 6.4% Latinx, 4.4% Black and 0.8% Native American — a slight rise in figures reported in 2020, according to an annual diversity report the company released last year. “Black+” employees, with the plus designation reflecting those who identify as multiple races, made up 8.8% of Google’s U.S. hires, compared with 5.5% the previous year, the report said. Attrition was on the rise among racial minority groups, with Black women showing the highest jump in the metric, according to the report."

Aging in the shadows: llinois’ new health care program for undocumented seniors leaves some of the most vulnerable behind
By LAURA RODRÍGUEZ PRESA AND CARLOS BALLESTEROS Chicago Tribune and Injustice Watch 

For more than a decade, Ananias Ocampo pushed a heavy ice cream cart through the streets of the Pilsen neighborhood as he waited for knee replacement surgery. When it got too cold for ice cream, the 78-year-old would go door-to-door selling homemade cheese even though he depended on a walker. “It was a blessing to be able to work,” he said in Spanish. Even as his pace got slower and he developed Parkinson’s disease, he had no option other than to keep working to sustain himself. Like most undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, Ocampo did not have health insurance. And though he received care at a public hospital, he had to keep waiting for the surgery. “Pero nunca perdí la esperanza,” he smiled. “I never lost hope.” In December 2020, Ocampo got a lifeline when Illinois lawmakers passed a new Medicaid-like program that covers low-income residents age 65 and older, regardless of their immigration status. But it was bittersweet. Unlike standard Medicaid coverage for U.S. citizens, the new health care program does not include funding for long-term care facilities like rehabilitation centers, nursing homes and other home and community-based services. That means that Ocampo — who lives alone and has no family in Chicago who could take care of him after the intensive surgery — would not qualify to stay at a rehab facility as he recovered. The street vendor decided to go forward with the surgery when Hilda Burgos, 54, a health care advocate, pledged to care for him after the surgery. She rallied community members to donate essentials, and raised funds to ensure that Ocampo had enough money to pay rent.
“Unfortunately, there are many more undocumented elders that live alone, or whose families cannot afford or don’t have the ability to care for them as they age,” Burgos said. “That means that even if they now have better access to health care, many more of their needs to better their quality of life are not addressed.” Ocampo’s case illustrates the promises and pitfalls in Illinois’ Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program. As it stands, the program makes critical health services available to a vulnerable population who often leave chronic illnesses unattended due to a lack of insurance, according to health experts. And in May, the program also will be available for unauthorized immigrants age 55 and older. But the carve-outs for extended care and at-home health care still leave a critical gap in coverage, health experts say, and force the economic and emotional responsibility of caregiving onto undocumented seniors’ families and communities. That formula could be a problem for Illinois as the number of seniors living in the U.S. without authorization is set to grow exponentially over the next decade. A recent report by Rush University Medical Center and demographer Rob Paral estimates that the undocumented senior population in the state will hit 55,000 by 2030, up from nearly 4,000 in 2017. Eréndira Rendón, an organizer with Healthy Illinois, said the state and federal governments need to find ways to provide comprehensive health care for this population before it hits crisis levels. That’s because uninsured undocumented immigrants often leave chronic illnesses unattended, leading to overuse of emergency care, which strains safety-net hospitals and ends up costing the state more with higher health care charges overall.
More than 9,000 seniors enrolled in the health care program in its first year — three times as many as advocates had estimated would benefit from the program when they lobbied for the bill in Springfield in spring 2020. “The numbers (of enrollees) show the need of this population often living under the shadow. It also shows the potential crisis that this can cause if this issue is not addressed by our leaders in the state, but also federally,” Rendón said. Something to be thankful for Both Ocampo and Burgos said they are grateful for the health care coverage they had prayed for, despite the program’s limitations. “It’s a blessing for many of us,” said Burgos, who is undocumented and has fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain all over the body, sleep problems, fatigue, and often emotional and mental distress. When she turns 55 in May, she hopes to become one of the first beneficiaries of the health care program’s expansion, which will give her better and faster access to specialists and acute procedures, she said. The Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program grew out of a yearslong campaign by Chicago activists and health care leaders to fill the gaps in health coverage for unauthorized immigrants. Advocates put more pressure on lawmakers to create a program covering noncitizen seniors after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The virus had disproportionately affected low-income Black and Latinx communities, especially older adults who couldn’t afford to stop working throughout the health crisis. Illinois was the first state to fully fund this type of health coverage for undocumented seniors. Shortly after, California approved a program to cover adults 50 and older, and Oregon’s governor signed a plan to offer health care coverage to low-income adults over age 19 regardless of immigration status. New York state is on the verge of passing a plan similar to Oregon’s.
By the end of its first year in December 2021, the Illinois health care program had enrolled more than 6,500 unauthorized seniors and about 2,500 legal permanent residents who obtained their green card within the last five years, which makes them ineligible for standard Medicaid. State data shows the program covers a diverse group of immigrant seniors across Illinois. Enrollees speak more than 40 languages and live in 51 of the state’s 102 counties. But most elders covered under the program are Latinx and live in Cook County. To qualify, they must live in a household with an income below the poverty line (just under $27,000 a year for a household of four). Doctors, health advocates and the senior enrollees themselves say Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults has been nothing short of life-changing. Dr. Kimberly Dixon, head of geriatric medicine at Stroger Hospital and Ocampo’s primary care physician, said she recently informed one of her patients — an 80-year-old undocumented woman — that she qualified for coverage under the program. “She burst into tears,” Dixon said. “She didn’t need a knee replacement service. She needed something much more mundane and simple. She needed pull ups because she has urinary incontinence.” Stories like that of Dixon’s patient abound among the program’s beneficiaries. But lack of funding in the program for long-term care and community-based health services leaves many behind. “What it means is that (the program) doesn’t provide people with any options if they are not safe at home,” said Padraic Stanley, program coordinator for health promotion programs at Rush University Medical Center. Stanley co-authored the Rush report that estimated the exponential increase of undocumented seniors in Illinois over the next decade. “So if people are incapacitated to the point where they can’t function on their own to do their activities of daily living like cooking, cleaning, eating, bathing, then essentially there’s no option for them and the family has to basically work around the clock to provide that for the member,” Stanley said. “And if they’re not able to, then that person will inevitably end up in the hospital or severely sick or injured.”
In a written statement, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services said the department “would favor members in this population receiving additional home and community-based services.” But the issue comes down to money. The program cost more than $100 million in its first year, according to state data. Unlike Medicaid, state spending for the program is not reimbursed by the federal government. The department has projected how much it would cost to provide long-term and home health care services — but it refused to share the data requested by Injustice Watch and the Chicago Tribune in a Freedom of Information Act filing. State lawmakers and policy advocates said they haven’t seen the numbers the department used to justify the carve-outs. “They told us that it’s too expensive,” said state Rep. Delia Ramirez, chief co-sponsor of the legislation that created the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program But advocates say the cost is well worth it. Research shows that providing primary care for unlawfully present seniors reduces the number of emergency hospital visits, which inevitably get paid by the state or charitable reserves at hospitals and health systems. “If we don’t spend $100 million on (health care for) seniors who are undocumented, it’s not like the state saved $100 million. If we cut the program tomorrow, those costs are still there. It’s just cost shifting. It’s someone else absorbing those costs,” said Andrea Kovach, a senior attorney at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “(Undocumented) seniors are still getting sick. They’re still having accidents,” she said. Last year, state lawmakers successfully expanded the program to cover undocumented immigrants age 55 to 64. And last month, Ramirez introduced a bill that would extend Medicaid coverage for noncitizen immigrants ages 19 and older who meet the program’s income requirements. The proposal, dubbed Healthy Illinois for All, would cover nearly 150,000 low-income immigrants who are not eligible for the state Medicaid program, according to the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. (The state already provides health care for low-income children under age 18 regardless of immigration status.)
Ramirez, who is running for Congress this year, said she and her colleagues behind the program are working to get the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to fill in the programs’ gaps for seniors. “We’ve made it clear to HFS that we expect (the carved-out services) to be included as we roll out this next program,” she said. Picking up where the state leaves off As state lawmakers work to fill gaps in the program for undocumented seniors, community groups, family members and volunteers try to provide the moral, physical and financial support that institutions and government agencies don’t provide. But looming over them is a demographic bubble that they say will stretch them thin and leave too many seniors behind. “We need to prepare for this,” said Enrique Jimenez, program director at the Latino Alzheimer’s and Memory Disorders Alliance (LAMDA) in Chicago. “We need to prepare better programming, better outreach efforts and resources for this population because they’re not going anywhere.” The alliance serves more than 100 seniors with memory disorders and more than 300 caregivers from Chicago and nearby suburbs. Many of the patients and caregivers are undocumented, Jimenez said. The alliance offers leisure programming for the seniors, like karaoke and Zumba classes, and trains caregivers on how to manage the illnesses. “It can really disrupt the whole family and their quality of life. It’s like a domino effect after the illness is detected,” said the group’s co-founder, Constantina Mizis. “Sometimes those caring for the loved one must leave their job to care for them, which then causes economic hardship and thus more stress and trauma. It’s a family disease.” Jimenez and Mizis applaud the creation of the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program. But as the population they serve grows every year, Jimenez is concerned about the alliance’s ability to keep up. “We are already in need of more resources to serve better and provide more resources to the elders and their families. I worry that as the population grows, we just won’t have enough funding,” he said. And even though there are several organizations and nonprofits like LAMDA that offer resources to these growing populations, many undocumented immigrants are afraid to seek help because they fear deportation, or due to language and technology barriers.
Instead, many immigrants without proper documentation, such as Burgos and Ocampo, seek and create community with one another, helping to care for each other, find work, pay off debt, and generally look out for each other. ‘If I didn’t stay, who would?’ It didn’t take long for Burgos to notice that Ocampo could barely walk when she met him three years ago as he pushed his ice cream cart around Pilsen. She began accompanying him to all of his doctor’s appointments, eventually helping to land him the long-awaited knee surgery at UI Health. “But it was bittersweet news,” she said. The surgeons told Burgos and Ocampo that he would need around-the-clock monitoring after the surgery — but the hospital’s social workers told them his insurance didn’t cover the aftercare he needed at the hospital, or any other facilities. “I didn’t know how, but I decided that I was going to care for him and prayed that God gave me the strength to do it, just like I would care for my son or my father,” Burgos said. When Ocampo awoke from the surgery in October, she was next to him. “I felt blessed to have someone like (Burgos), to have a whole community that cares so much for me,” he said. Burgos insisted to his doctors that Ocampo wasn’t ready to go home. “I practically begged them, I explained to them that his home was not equipped to even live there, let alone recover from the surgery,” she said. The hospital relented and kept Ocampo for two more weeks. Once the two weeks were up, Burgos took Ocampo to his apartment, even though he was still in delicate health. Initially, she didn’t plan to spend the night, but she couldn’t find it in her heart to leave him. She fed him. She bathed him. She cleaned his apartment. And even when Ocampo tested positive for COVID-19 just a few days after coming back from the hospital, she didn’t leave. “If I didn’t stay, who would?” Burgos said.
Since then, Burgos has helped Ocampos secure new housing by advocating for a new city policy that makes it easier for self-employed workers in Chicago to qualify for affordable housing. But Burgos said that caring for the beloved ice cream vendor by herself took a toll on her already fragile health. After she cared for Ocampo for nearly five weeks, her doctors advised her to rest. Ocampo has almost fully recovered from the knee replacement surgery to his right joint, and his surgeon told him that he will be ready for a second surgery as soon as May. But Burgos doesn’t think she can take care of him again. Unless he gets approved for a rehab facility that would guarantee that a professional can take care of him while he recovers, Burgos said she doesn’t see how Ocampo will be able to get the next surgery. “If no one can take care of me or I can’t stay in the hospital until I’m able to walk on my own (after surgery), then I just think I won’t get it anymore,” Ocampo said while walking down 18th street on a warmer day in March. “The pain isn’t so bad anymore.”
