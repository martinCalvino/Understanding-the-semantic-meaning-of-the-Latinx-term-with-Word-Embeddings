Using the term ‘Latinx,’ exhibition shows immigrants who merged into cultures of their new homes

The top 10 U.S. cities with the highest percentages of Latin American residents are, not surprisingly, in Texas, California and Florida. But none of them is featured in “Gateways/Portales” at the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Community Museum. The exhibition sticks closer to home, surveying the Latino surge in Washington and Baltimore, as well as Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
The museum’s galleries are packed with art and artifacts, photos and video, sociology and journalism, as well as lots of text, all of it bilingual. Amid the profusion, the show does simplify one thing by employing a recently coined term: “Latinx.” It’s gender neutral and also suggests the diversity of heritages in a region that stretches from the Caribbean almost to Antarctica, and includes people of indigenous, African and European descent.
A section on U.S. census designations illustrates the complexity. The 2010 Census had separate categories for racial identity and “Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin.” The text notes, “Latinx is not a race. However, a majority of Latinxs consider it part of their racial identity.”
The significant Latinx presence in the four locations is relatively recent. A section on street festivals establishes a rough chronology: D.C.’s Fiesta D.C. (originally the Latino Festival) began in 1970. Baltimore’s Latino Fest started a decade later. Raleigh’s La Fiesta del Pueblo dates to 1994, and “Hola Charlotte” to 2012.
That’s not the only difference. In Washington, Latinx newcomers moved mostly into neighborhoods that were predominantly African American. (And by 2011, the city had the country’s largest percentage of foreign-born Latinx residents.) In Baltimore, they found a place in such districts as Highlandtown, known a generation ago for its Greek-rooted population. North Carolina, which is more rural, initially attracted many Latinx agricultural workers.
Among the exhibits is a pair of battered boots worn by a Mexican farmworker named Cornelio Campos, who continued that vocation in North Carolina. (Appropriately, Campos means “fields.”) They belonged to one individual but evoke anyone who has labored (or whose ancestors labored) in the dirt.
Despite hailing mostly from Spanish-speaking countries, the immigrants were unlike in many ways. Those differences grew as they merged into the cultures of their new homes. “Dominicans in D.C. identify as black more often than Dominicans in other places,” the show reports. A section on food spotlights a cookbook, Sandra A. Gutierrez’s “The New Southern-Latino Table,” that insists its readers have both a tor­tilla press and a biscuit cutter.
Assimilation isn’t always so simple. The show doesn’t directly mention recent scapegoating of Latinx immigrants, but it does include a section on riots in the District’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood in 1991 and in Baltimore in 2015. The latter was in reaction to the death of Freddie Gray, an African American, while in police custody, which inspired supportive graffiti by Latinx Baltimore artists.
A separate section of the exhibition offers a footnote to the tensions that erupted along Mount Pleasant Street 26 years ago: A list of Latinx elected officials shows how few have achieved political power in the District. That part of the chronicle remains to be written.
“Gateways/Portales” is not an art exhibition, but it does include posters and paintings, notably several by Rosalia Torres-Weiner. The versatile Charlotte resident channels 20th-century Mexican muralist Diego Rivera in “Uprising Against ICE”; arms the Virgin of Guadalupe with an AK-47 in her Pop Art-style “Madre Protectora”; and matches a 3-D flowered mask with the Statue of Liberty’s crown in her magical-realist “Hispanics, the New Italians.”
There’s also a partly collaged self-portrait by Nicolás Shi, a veteran Washington artist with a background that’s complicated even by Latinx standards: He’s from El_Salvador but of Chinese descent.
One of the niftiest artworks on display is shown only in a photograph, since it’s too big to move (and is needed right where it is). The picture shows a Baltimore bus shelter that has been pierced by a giant red pushpin and emblazoned with this reminder: “Estamos aqui” — in English, “We are here.”
Adjacent galleries feature photographic portraits of Latinx notables such as D.C. poet and performer Quique Aviles, as well as sculptures by Derek Webster, a Honduras-born folk artist who spent much of his life in Chicago. Made of found objects and embellished with house paint and costume jewelry, the assemblages tell a story that can read throughout the museum: a saga of strength, exuberance and self-invention."

I don’t speak Spanish. Does that make me less Latinx?
Perspective by Justin Agrelo

It happened again a few weeks ago. I was in a restaurant in Buenos Aires having brunch with a fellow Fulbright Scholar. We’re both in Argentina teaching English in the provinces. She ordered first, with ease and a smile. My order wasn’t quite as seamless. I had practiced what to say before the server reached our table, but when she arrived, the script I drafted in my head became tangled as it left my mouth. My order was choppy. Nonsensical. Bad. Nonetheless, the server understood what I meant, and went to place our orders, leaving us to sit with the mess my tongue created.
“Oh my God, your Spanish!” my brunch mate said, before laughing.
And then I felt it. The pressure in my head. The tightening between my shoulders. The slow reddening of my face. The feeling of being an impostor. A fraud. A “fake” Latino. Someone whose family is from Puerto_Rico but grew up speaking English. Feelings I’ve felt my entire life. Feelings that are intensified when my Spanish is policed by non-Latinx, such as my Chinese American colleague at brunch.
I put my head on the table and began scrolling through Instagram. I didn’t want to talk about my Spanish. I know the way I sound when I pause for too long in between words, desperate for the rest of the sentence to hurry up and find me. I’m familiar with my colleague’s response, that scoff, and its underlying, thinly veiled judgment.
In Argentina, the reaction to me not knowing Spanish is different than it is in the States. Because my U.S. identity is always so visible here, it often hides many other parts of who I am. Not as many people initially question why I don’t speak Spanish because I am read as just another Yankee (a non-Latinx, English-speaking identity) and not immediately as Latinx. Whereas back home, my Latinx identity is never not visible and therefore neither is the fact that I don’t speak Spanish.
Though different on their surfaces, the experience of being a non-Spanish-speaking Latino in Buenos Aires and in Chicago overlap much more than they don’t. What these experiences share, over a distance of 5,000 miles, is that same painful vergüenza.
Confessing that I do not speak Spanish has always felt shameful and wrapped in that shame are these feelings that my Latinidad is generic, inauthentic, decorative, even — a garment I can easily put on whenever I want to feel connectedness (Latin American) or unique (U.S.) and take off whenever I no longer want to be otherized, oppressed, invisible.
The perpetuation of the idea that Latinxs who don’t speak Spanish are less Latinx because we speak a different colonizer’s language carries with it an incredibly exhausting burden of insecurity and isolation. It relegates us to an identity that is stifling and incomplete, oscillating somewhere between American and Latinx, but never quite reaching either side.
Claiming that I am less Puerto_Rican because I only speak English is also an act of erasure. It erases the violent and racist history of the United States’ occupation of Puerto_Rico. It erases the forced migration of Puerto_Ricans to the mainland in search of opportunity only to be met with the same inhumane conditions they were fleeing: state violence, inadequate health care, poor housing, exploitative wages, drugs, and disappointment.
It erases a white supremacist society’s culpability in the loss of our culture, our language, our history, and ascribes responsibility to individuals trying to survive its oppressive grip.
It erases the mornings I woke up to my mom cleaning while “La India” played on the stereo, singing every word to “Mi Mayor Venganza” with more passion than your faves ever could.
It erases the years I screamed “¡Boricua!” from a sunroof on Division Street every June.
It erases the two-bedroom apartment on Armitage and Kedzie where the six of us lived, long before Humboldt Park became a white hipster playground.
It erases the loss my grandmother felt stepping off that plane in 1959, now beneath a different moon, a universe away from her country, unsure of everything except a small, burgeoning fact in the corner of her mind, whispering to her that one day her grandkids might never be able to ask her what she missed most about The Island and why.
It erases the fact that I shouldn’t have to list any of this to prove my Latinidad, yet I am almost always having to prove myself — to those from my community and, even worse, to those who are not.
Far too often has a non-Latinx person, who has zero stake in our culture, our politics, our collective struggle, felt bold enough to comment on my “broken” Spanish. People who grew up in neighborhoods that welcomed the trendy “Latin” restaurant, but criminalized the elotero, have felt entitled enough to police my fluency in the language my parents said “I love you” in. The language my dad sang his favorite Héctor Lavoe songs in. The language my grandmother said her goodbyes in at his funeral.
And because of this, it is time we, Latinx and non-Latinx people, let go of the rigid expectations of what it means to be a “real Latinx” that give way for this toxic policing. It is time we fully accept the vastness of Latinidad. It is time we let go of these stigmatizing beliefs that to be a “real Latinx” your family must have resisted all efforts of forced assimilation. It is time we allow what it means to be a “real Latinx” to be as fluid, diverse, and multifaceted as we are."

A new report says Hispanic identity is fading. Is that really good for America?
Analysis by Ed Morales

Last semester, a student of mine named Fernando came to speak with me after the last meeting of my class on Latino identity. He thanked me for getting him to think about not only his roots but his connections with other Latinos, and our contributions to history and culture. He was an engineering student of Colombian ancestry and he’d done a presentation about a 1992 song by Mexican alternative rock group Café Tacuba called “Trópico de Cancer.” The song was about a Mexican engineer who questioned the threat to the environment by unbridled development, and rejected the notion of the superiority of modern civilization and the so-called savageness of indigenous culture.Students like Fernando represent a pattern among some young Latinos who were raised as “American” and during the crucial formative years find an urge to connect with and understand their ancestral culture that is often sacrificed in the pursuit of mainstream acceptance. These young people defy the notion of gradual assimilation that is often the conclusion of carefully researched studies, because the way Latinos relate with their cultural and racial identity is never set in stone. How we see ourselves can take a marked turn that can be inspired by personal experience and political and historical circumstances.
A study released last month by the Pew Research Center suggested that lower immigration levels and high interracial marriage rates among Hispanics causes their identification as Hispanic to fade over generations. The study says that although recent immigrants identify as Hispanic at a rate of almost 90 percent, this number drops to around 50 percent after the fourth generation. Currently, 11 percent of adults with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as such, the report stated, and 23 percent of Hispanics most often refer to themselves as “American.” The implication of these findings, say the researchers, is that despite projections that Latinos will be 24 percent of the U.S. population by 2065, these trends in self-identification may affect the way we view the influence and impact of Hispanic identity in the future, as well as the notion of a future majority-minority United States.
Whether we choose to identify ourselves as Hispanic, Latino, or the increasingly popular Latinx, these labels help us find our place in American society and culture. While there will always be Hispanics who no longer need or want to identify, the forces in society that create “included” and “excluded” groups on the basis of what one’s race or ethnicity appears to be are not going away. From the early 20th-century activism of W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey through the civil rights movement, African-Americans have consolidated a powerful notion of identity based on racial solidarity. This approach pushed back against anti-black racism and yielded tangible political results, as well as power and influence in American society. Such leverage will remain elusive to Hispanics if we move away from acknowledging and embracing our “difference.”Hispanic identity is fluid to begin with, because so many of us have mixed-race ancestries. That why it’s important to put this issue in proper historical and social context — and no disrespect to the Pew Research Center, whose work on Hispanics I find extremely valuable. Our multiracial backgrounds make it more likely for Latinos to “lose” our identification than African Americans. The strict black/white binary of racial identity in the United States differs from the more nuanced racially mixed narrative of Latin America, whose societies offered a form of “racial status mobility” through intermarriage with Europeans. In the past some have chosen to strive for whiteness through marriage — in Spanish it’s an adage called “mejorar la raza” or “better the race.”  But many Hispanics reject white identity: On the census forms most Latinos prefer not to identify as either black or white, and 97 percent of those who check the “some other race” category are Hispanic. The report cites the slow growth in immigration as a factor in decreasing Hispanic identification. But the reason for that decrease could be influenced by current political and economic trends. The slowdown in the U.S. economy since 2008 has substantially lowered rates of immigration, but the anti-immigrant attitudes that have been stoked in America in recent years and have climaxed with ascendant white nativism and the election of Donald Trump are also to blame. Such a climate, which can cause concern over something as small as micro-aggressions in the workplace to more serious concerns like a rise in hate crime, are a strong motivation for avoiding identification as Hispanic.
Decreased contact with Spanish-speaking relatives and cultural celebrations also are cited in the report as significant reasons that Hispanics are losing their identity. Culture is often transmitted, as the study says, through “pride” for Hispanic cultural traditions — which can include influences from Spanish, indigenous/Amerindian and African origins — practiced by parents and relatives. Such pride can be traced back to political movements of the 1960s that were a reaction to difficulties Hispanics faced during the 1950s, when Operation Wetback led to thousands of deportations and the stereotyping of young Puerto_Ricans as juvenile delinquents criminalized a generation. The lessening of this talk about pride in later generations can be due to increased assimilation and the success of affirmative action programs. But the recent surge in anti-Latino sentiment can potentially spark the return of pride messaging. And then there’s the issue of language. The report explores the connection between fluency in Spanish and Hispanic identity. But there is a growing trend in which young Hispanics are insisting they are Latinx even if they don’t speak Spanish. This is the response of a generation of U.S.-born Hispanics who sometimes find their identities challenged by natives of their home countries who don’t think they’re Hispanic enough, and come off as too American. All of these factors suggest that while the Pew Research Center’s findings have validity, Hispanic identity is always changing — between identifications with the larger label “Hispanic” and that of specific countries, between being bilingual or English- or Spanish dominant. The gray area that Latinos inhabit in this country’s historical black/white binary inevitably leads to shifts in identification that are the rule rather than the exception.
What’s most important is that labels like Hispanic or Latino will always be here as long as mainstream America remains intolerant to difference. The importance of the ethno-racial designation is the way it can be used by the Census Bureau to determine the need for social programs that address wealth inequality, access to education, and residential segregation, to name a few of our nation’s societal imbalances.
Viewed through such a lens, it becomes clearer that to identify as Hispanic or Latino is not just a whim, a personal preference, or a demographic or cultural trend, but often an act of survival."

Emma González: La nueva cara of Florida Latinx
Perspective by Ed Morales

In the aftermath of the horrific Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, a new movement has emerged that constitutes the strongest voice for changing laws about automatic assault weapons since the Columbine massacre of 1999.
Emma González, the face of this movement, took a leadership role with a passionate speech in front of the Broward County Courthouse, where she criticized President Trump and other politicians for accepting donations from the National Rifle Association.
But while González and her fellow students David Hogg and Cameron Kasky represent a youth protest movement that may finally lead to more gun control, Emma stands out as an emblematic challenge to the old ways of Cuban-American voting preferences in Florida, one of the most important swing states in national elections. She also portends a new generation of Latino youth who have the potential to be major political players through their ability to straddle different constituencies and mold a coherent message for change.
The daughter of Jose González, now a lawyer who arrived from Cuba in New York in 1968, Emma is unwavering in her embrace of her identity. “I’m 18 years old, Cuban, and bisexual,” she says in the lead paragraph of her recent essay published in Harper’s Bazaar. While Univision reported that she does not speak Spanish, she doesn’t shy away from her Cuban identity. And though The Sun Sentinel has reported that her short buzz-cut is for practical reasons — “Hair is just another sweater I’m forced to wear,” she demurred — her participation in her school’s Gay-Straight Alliance and recent self-outing resounds with queerness.
Yet, while Emma juggles the many roles of her active adolescence, she is able to focus clearly and resolutely on an endemic problem that is threatening U.S. politics and its democracy. “What matters is that the majority of American people have become complacent in a senseless injustice that occurs all around them,” she writes in Harpers Bazaar. “What matters is that most American politicians have become more easily swayed by money than by the people who voted them into office.”
Ana María Dopico, associate professor and director of the King Juan Carlos Center at New York University, says González calls to mind legendary Cuban revolutionary José Martí. “As someone who has written about José Martí, who was a teenager when he became a political prisoner and went on to be a poet and political star, watching Emma González is absolutely fascinating,” said Dopico. “Her open-hearted self-exposure, the mourning over martyred friends, the claim for youth as leaders of history, the call to the future, the remaking of citizenship, all these are part of Cuban and U.S. political history.”
González, who now has more followers on Twitter than the NRA, last week participated, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), in the most-watched town hall on CNN. During the event, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, refused to say whether he would accept further donations from the NRA, instead offering a confusing argument that contributions from the group are not the issue, instead what matters is that voters “buy into my agenda” of supporting the Second Amendment.
González represents a trend that has been happening for years in Florida. As the hard-right agenda formed by the original exiles from Fidel Castro’s Cuba age and fade in political significance, Cuban voters have consistently moved away from Republicans and toward Democrats. Rubio has struggled to straddle the two groups. In his last election, exit polls showed he performed best with older voters and Cuban Americans than he did with voters under 40 and other Latinos.
Trump won 54 percent of the Cuban American vote in the 2016 presidential election, according to Edison Research, which conducts exit polling for the major news networks. Latino Decisions, which focuses on Hispanic voters, reported a slightly lower 52 percent. Hard-line anti-Castro Cubans may have supported Trump because of his desire to roll back former president Barack Obama’s policy of openness toward the communist country. But compare the Trump numbers with the 78 percent of Cuban Americans who supported George W. Bush in 2004. The Pew Hispanic Center said in 2014 that this trend has been shaped by younger Cubans who were born in the United States.
Emma González not only represents a younger Cuban American demographic that is changing its views toward engagement with Cuba, but also is sharing the political shift toward progressive ideals characteristic of millennials and the upcoming Generation Z.
The older end of the millennial spectrum began the shift when they realized that, after the 2008 recession, their prospects for a stable career and the ability to afford a home were dwindling rapidly. Now a teenager-driven youth movement demanding changes in gun-control laws is becoming active out of a desperate fear for their lives in an environment that was supposed to protect their innocence and safety.
While there are valid comparisons between the movement Emma is helping to lead and youth movements in other parts of the world, like Chile, the dramatic threat to the nation’s students has sparked a political paroxysm that could best be concerned with the activism that helped end the Vietnam War. In those days, students marched because they objected to being sent to Southeast Asia and face death in a war whose worth was not clear. Now they march because they face death in their own places of learning.
A year and change into the Trump presidency, many groups — women, Muslim and Latino immigrants, African Americans — have been attacked and belittled, not only by the president’s callous behavior but also by the tenacious tactics of the Republican right. As a student, Emma represents not only youth but women, Latinos and the LGBT community.
“It’s interesting that she chose to say she belongs to multiple communities,” said Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology and head of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. “It was a recognition of shared interests between communities.”
NYU’s Dopico said that Gonzáles’s “queerness connects her both to a U.S. politics of social justice and to Cuban and Cuban American struggles for queer rights. She is part of a generation that feels freer about claiming identities and loyalties.”
Can Emma González be the future of Latino politics in Florida as well as a new intersectional movement among America’s youth to roll back conservative political trends decades in the making?
Even though Emma claims, in her Harper’s Bazaar essay, that “I’m so indecisive that I can’t pick a favorite color,” perhaps it’s not all that much of a drawback. By acknowledging all her varied spaces and identities, she has found the strength to draw them together to advocate for a single issue that might define a generation."

‘Latinx’: An offense to the Spanish language or a nod to inclusion?
By Rachel Hatzipanagos

When the final letter in “Latino” or “Latina” is replaced with an “x,” it’s hard not to notice.
The gender-neutral word “Latinx” is increasingly the preferred terminology to describe people of Latin American descent and has become so popular that it was added to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary last week.
Proponents insist that the word is necessary in the name of inclusion, especially for those who are LGBT and gender-nonconforming. But its use is still controversial and often prompts visceral reactions for some Spanish speakers, who sometimes encounter it online before they hear it used in person.
“The term was coined within queer Internet groups. That was where it was used first and foremost,” said María R. Scharrón-del Río, a professor of psychology at Brooklyn College who uses the pronouns they/them.
“Latinx” first surfaced in popular usage more than a decade ago, although Scharrón-del Río points out that the LGBT community used it long before then. According to data from Google Trends, which tracks the popularity of words in its search engine, “Latinx” spiked in popularity in 2016.
Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster, said the ‘x’ construction could become a model that spreads to other languages with grammatical gender agreement, such as Filipino or French. But the decision to add it to the dictionary was an objective one, he said.
“The job of the dictionary is to follow the changes in the culture that are expressed in the language,” Sokolowski said. “The only constant in language is change, and we want to keep up.”
Although the term has increased in frequency as an alternative to the collective Latino, Latino/a or Latin@, some argue that it’s insensitive to the Spanish language, in which all nouns carry a gender and there is no obvious way to pronounce the letter x. When Latinx-focused publications such as Remezcla use the term, it’s often met with criticism.
In a Facebook comment for a Remezcla story, reader Sandra Velez said the publication’s use of “Latinx” amounted to “Anglicizing the Spanish language.”
“Do they hate or revile their Hispanic/Latino ancestry so much they are willing (unwitting?) accomplices in erasing their own heritage? Because that’s exactly what’s happening,” she wrote.
Orietta Ramirez, a 56-year-old New Yorker who works in human resources, is a first-generation daughter of Chilean immigrants who prefers to use “Latina” for herself or “Latinos” in reference to a group.
“I am proud that our Hispanic language differentiates between male and female,” Ramirez wrote in a Facebook message. “Not a fan of homogenizing our sexuality into one word just to make others comfortable or one that would simplify our colorful, cultural descriptive differences, in my opinion.”
Ruby Corado, a transgender activist, prefers to identify as Latina because identifying herself with a gender-neutral word is fraught with complexity.
“I grew up fighting for my gender to be recognized as Latina,” said Corado, who was born in El_Salvador but has lived in Washington, D.C., for decades. “That’s something that’s not going to change, but [Latinx] is something I’m adapting to as I’m doing work with millennials.”
Corado is an activist and founder of Casa Ruby, an LGBTQ bilingual and multicultural organization in Washington. She said that many of the younger people she works with prefer the term “Latinx,” a word she’s slowly adapting to.
“I come from the old school, so I actually like the term ‘Latina,’ ” said Corado, who speaks both Spanish and English. “But I embrace that term, [Latinx] as well. You have to understand, I came from a time when everything was gender-based.”
Whatever people choose to identify as, the Latinx issue is likely to be constantly evolving as part of the greater conversation in the community about machismo and increased visibility of those who don’t fit into neat categories of masculine or feminine.
“We need to see more and that’s part of what the ‘x’ does — it makes visible the fact that people aren’t included within the ‘a’ or the ‘o.’ And it’s really a linguistic intervention,” Scharrón-del Río said. “Just knowing that there is an ‘x’ makes you think about what that means and makes you question what you often take for granted.”"

Elizabeth Warren can call me whatever she wants: Latina, Hispanic, Latinx.
Perspective by Theresa Vargas

Some years back, I sat in the front row of a community event, waiting for a high-ranking police officer to address a room filled with immigrants from Central and South America.
I flipped open my notebook and uncapped my pen.
I was in reporter mode, ready to write down his remarks.
Then, to my surprise, he looked at me, leaned in close and quietly asked, “It is more appropriate to say Hispanic or Latino?”
That memory boomeranged back at me the other day because of all the recent talk surrounding another word: Latinx. That whispered question, I realized, if asked today, might have to include a third choice: “Is it more appropriate to say Hispanic, Latino or Latinx?”
The word Latinx is not new. Neither are the debates it inspires (sometimes within the same family). But in the past week and a half, divisive online discussions about the word have been fueled by two events.
On Nov. 1, a market-research firm published the results of a survey on Medium under the title, “Progressive Latino pollster: 98% of Latinos do not identify with ‘Latinx’ label.”
And on Nov. 5, a New York Times opinion piece carried the headline, “Liberalism’s Latinx Problem: Why is Elizabeth Warren describing Latinos with a term that few would use themselves?”
Let’s start with that survey. The firm that conducted it, ThinkNow, said it grew out of a curiosity “about the appeal of ‘Latinx’ among the country’s 52 million people of Latin American ancestry.”
The Medium piece explained that the firm polled 508 people, presenting them with the most common terms used to describe that population. They were then tasked with picking the one that best described them. Their options: Hispanic, Latino/Latina, American, my country of origin, my country of origin + American, Chicano/Chicana, Latinx, and if all those felt wrong, “I don’t like any of these names/labels.”The results reflected what you might expect because of some terms’ long-established places in our language wells. Most people chose “Hispanic” and “Latino/Latina.”
Few chose “Latinx.”
“Despite its usage by academics and cultural influencers, 98% of Latinos prefer other terms to describe their ethnicity,” read the piece. “Only 2% of our respondents said the label accurately describes them, making it the least popular ethnic label among Latinos.”
We could pause here and dissect the survey. We could try to pull it apart piece by piece.
We could also just give it what it’s worth: a shrug.
It’s not surprising that most people with Latin American roots don’t reach for that identifier first. Most didn’t grow up hearing it roll off the tongues of their abuelas. Some may have never heard it at all. I know some of my Mexican American relatives haven’t.I also know that if I asked them to describe themselves, they would all reach for different words. One might say Hispanic. Another, Mexican. Another, Mexican American. And, because I have a BIG family, it’s a safe bet there are a few Latinxs in there.
Sure, some Latinos despise that “x” and have criticized it as crossing out their heritage. In an article by my colleague Rachel Hatzipanagos, a woman described it as “Anglicizing the Spanish language.” In that same article, Ruby Corado, a transgender activist in the District, who had to fight to be recognized as a Latina, said, “I come from the old school, so I actually like the term ‘Latina.’ But I embrace that term, [Latinx], as well.”
Picking a preferred identifier does not mean a person rejects all the other ones. I generally identify as “Latina” because it feels the most right to me and my experiences, but I wouldn’t snub my Chicana cousin or my Latinx nephew if they decide those are the labels that fit them best. I also understand why someone who graduated from my high school, which was majority Hispanic, might just call themselves “American.”But that complex picture is not the one you would have been left with if you clicked on different media sites after that Medium piece published. Several outlets placed the survey in a political context, connecting it to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s embrace of the word “Latinx.”
“Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners in the 2020 Democratic primary, frequently uses the term on the campaign [trail] including on the Democratic debate stage,” read a piece published that same night by the Washington Examiner. “In September, she celebrated ‘Latinx Heritage Month,’ which is usually recognized as National Hispanic Heritage Month, on Twitter.”
“Shocker! Latinos do not want progressives like Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Beto O’Rourke messing with their language,” read a piece that ran the next day on the conservative site TheBlaze.
At the top of that piece was the headline: “Poll: Genderless woke label ‘Latinx’ is not popular among Latinos.” At the bottom, the last line ended with a very unwoke, “muy bueno.”
The New York Times column, written by Ross Douthat, noted the progressive nature of the word (which Merriam-Webster added to its dictionary in September 2018). The “x” provides a gender-neutral, non-binary alternative to the feminine “Latina” and masculine “Latino,” which makes it popular among the LGBTQ community.
“When spoken, ‘Latinx’ sounds like neither normal English nor conversational Spanish, and it looks like what it is, a word designed for ideological purposes rather than for felicity in speech,” Douthat wrote. He went on to argue that Warren’s “adoption” of the word “suggests that Warren is distinctively beholden to a hermetic academic-progressive world, to a point where she doesn’t know how to talk to the less-ideological, less-woke, maybe-even-somewhat-conservative Hispanics whose votes her party needs.”
Warren may not win the Hispanic votes she needs. None of the Democratic candidates may. But let’s be real — if that happens, it won’t be because Latinos didn’t like the word she used or what it suggested about her.If that were true, then I wouldn’t still have relatives and former classmates with Hispanic last names who ardently support President Trump. He has described Latino immigrants as “rapists” and “animals.” More concerning, he has suggested certain citizens are not American. He described an Indiana-born federal judge as unable to be impartial because he was “Mexican.” And in September, he asked CNN contributor Steve Cortes, “Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?” As if one isn’t a part of the other.
In fairness, though, he did tweet about his love of Hispanics. Many people, I’m sure, haven’t forgotten when he wrote, “Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!”I understand the urge to push back against political correctness and how “Latinx” may seem like yet another way for a person to unintentionally offend someone. There is an easy way around that concern: You can ask people how they want to be identified.
When that police official asked me which word he should use, I knew he did so with the best of intentions.
I assured him either was fine.
I didn’t have a poll to support that. I just knew that the Latinos/Hispanics/Latinxs gathered in that room — just like many of us now tuned in to the presidential election — had so many high-stakes concerns that it didn’t matter what he called them."

The Democrats are Moving Left. Will America Follow?
Latinx voters are leading the shift to the left

For black and brown communities across our country, the question of whether America will follow the leftward surge is a question of life or death. Donald Trump is denying immigrants, specifically Latinx immigrants, a life in this country, or a life at all. The shootings in Ohio and El Paso are proof that the Trump presidency has put Latinx lives at risk by emboldening those who think that this country should work just for white people.
We — as Latinx voters and, more broadly, voters of color — are leading the move to the left. We are demanding that the Democratic Party follow. This is a huge shift for a party that has historically ignored us except for last-ditch efforts leading up to an election. Through grass-roots organizations and networks like the Center for Popular Democracy Action, Mijente, Texas Organizing Project, CASA, Make the Road and others, we are pushing the Democratic Party to take our votes seriously and propose policies that create a future for all of us in this country. The movement of the Democratic Party to the left is a necessary step, but a reactive one.
Voters of color, including Latinx voters, are an increasing percentage of the American electorate — and our share will only grow bigger. There are 32 million Latinx voters who will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election. For us to turn out, we need a candidate who will commit to undoing the damage that Trump has caused us and to proactively promoting a vision for this country that includes us and allows us to thrive.
If a leftward move of the Democratic Party means a move to represent our voices, our perspectives and our interests, then that is the direction we should be headed."

A Latinx New Yorker feels at home in a Latinx community searching for its identity in London
Perspective by Ed Morales

On a recent trip to London, I took the Underground from Oxford Circus to the city’s northern reaches in Tottenham, home to one of the centers of its Latinx community. A few steps from the Seven Sisters stop is the Latin Village market, also known as Pueblito Paisa, a nod to its thriving Colombian population. Once I was inside, I was immediately engulfed with familiar aromas of cilantro-laden soup, the sweet scent of pan de bono, and a cacophony of paisa-accented Spanish. Although I’d been to London years before, I’d only heard rumors about a Latinx hood. Since I had been invited because the British Academy had shortlisted my book Latinx for a prize it administered, I felt compelled to seek it out.
For a lifelong Latinx New Yorker, this festival of Latin American senses was straight out of a fever dream of an endless afternoon on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, where a strong Colombian ethos envelops a simmering mix of Ecuadorans, Argentineans, Peruvians, Mexicans, Dominicans, and yes, old-school Nuyoricans. But this was London, with its own kind of multicultural stew, where up High Road you can find El Botellón Tapas Restaurant and Cuban Cocktail Bar, or around the corner on Green Road, British Caribbean and African businesses offer “New York City Style” hair extensions and Congolese food. It was like a parallel universe, a different way of seeing that urban Afro-Latinx culture that had shaped me since my youth.
Latinx in London are just beginning to come into an awareness of themselves as a community, entering a stage parallel to where U.S. Latinx were in the 1960s and ’70s. Yet like contemporary U.S. Latinx, the London community has similar problems of visibility and is threatened by indifference, at times open hostility, and urban displacement. There are some important differences: Migrations from Latin America to London have been limited in size compared to the United States, forcing disparate groups to bond quickly. London Latinx are also coming together during a time strongly informed by evolutions in U.S. identity politics that didn’t exist 60 years ago.
As I sat sipping sancocho de gallina at the counter of La Esquina de Blanca (Blanca’s Corner), one of the 60 small businesses inside the Latin Village market, local filmmaker Romano Pizzichini, originally from Brazil, told me about government plans to demolish it in favor of a 40,000-foot retail space to be built by Grainger, a large-scale developer. Although retailers are being offered space in a temporary market across the street, they would have to wait two years to move back in, and the developer will not disclose the new rent guidelines.
Pizzichini, who immigrated to London via Toronto, tells me the market is an essential space for the Latinx community, where he “felt like a little bit of home,” despite having never been to Colombia and only being fluent in “portuñol,” which he describes as speaking Portuguese with a Spanish accent. Because it’s small and just coming together, and perhaps because of the greater distance from Latin America, Latinx in London make easier connections between what would be disparate groups in the United States. Whereas in the United States, Brazil’s status as Latinx is debated because of language difference, in London Brazilians and Spanish-speaking South Americans and Caribbeans find it easier to make common cause.
Pizzichini’s new short, called “More Than Other,” is a stark, intimate portrait of London’s Latinx community, featuring community activists, young feminists, a rapper and an actor whose father runs a taekwondo studio, all riffing on their fledgling identity and what it means.
Although the title of the film sheds light on the ambiguity of Latinx identity that exists in the United States, there is a governmental bureaucratic twist in the United Kingdom. There is no opportunity to identify yourself as someone of Latin American descent on the British census form, despite a detailed listing of white categories (English/Welsh/Scottish, Northern Island/British, Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller), mixed categories (white + black Caribbean, white + black African, white + Asian), Asian categories (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese), the Black/African/Caribbean/Black British category and “other ethnic group,” which includes “Arab.” As a result, Latinx, who as of 2013 are estimated to make up 250,000 in the U.K., are forced to check “other” boxes on the census and other government forms.
In the United States, Hispanic, an ethnic group whose members can belong to any race, is listed as a separate category on the census. On the 2010 and the 2020 census, Latinx can identify as “black” or other racial groups. In the lead-up to the current census, there was some debate as to whether to make Latinx a separate racial group — a contradiction in terms since Latinx comprise several different races — but that narrative was drowned out by the Trump administration’s controversial attempt to include a citizenship question, something the Supreme Court ruled out last year.
Despite U.S. Latinx identity’s long gestation period, we still struggle to be defined and understood by mainstream America — the recent controversy over the novel “American Dirt” seemed emblematic. This invisibility is something Latinx in London are just beginning to cope with. “Latinos end up being permanently in this state of otherness,” said professor Nathalie Teitler, co-editor of the just-published “Un Nuevo Sol” (A New Sun), the first significant anthology of British Latinx writers. “It’s almost like a form of violence, it’s very dangerous. There are racial attacks against Latinx people, but it’s not really classified as a racial attack because there’s no actual race.” In her introduction to the volume, Teitler writes that “to be British Latinx is to live in the experience of translating yourself on all levels, to be accustomed to people addressing a version of you that bears little resemblance to your actual identity … to know what it means to be both present and invisible.”
One of the most jolting things about Pizzichini’s film, made in collaboration with Rio-based production company Capuri and Breno Moreira, is seeing his Latinx subjects, with their varying racial appearances and mostly “urban” apparel so typical of Jackson Heights, the Bronx or East Harlem, speak in thick British accents that can become almost indecipherable. It’s evidence that Latinx identities are fusions of what is remembered from the home country and the linguistic-cultural reality of one’s new home. Aspiring actor Bryan Solarte, whose family is from Cali, Colombia, explains he’s influenced by a kind of generalized aesthetic that came together in the now-gentrified black Caribbean neighborhood of Brixton. “The way I speak might make you think I’m wearing a puffer jacket with my hoodie up. I grew up around a lot of black people, so my accent is more like that. It’s more relaxed, as opposed to Central London, where it’s more posh. A lot of that Black Caribbean and patois has influenced the way Londoners speak.”
Solarte also faces a problem I’ve heard for decades from U.S. Latinx actors — all the roles he’s offered are drug dealers or other criminal stereotypes, and he almost never sees films or TV shows, like the very popular “Black Mirror,” feature any kind of Latinx characterization. He does this in a lilting banter that sounds Scottish/Irish to me, though filtered through black Caribbeans in Brixton, near where he grew up in South London. “I get called Mexican because of TV shows like “Narcos,” and when I tell them I’m Colombian, it’s more of the same thing,” said Solarte.
While London Latinx are having a renaissance moment, it remains to be seen how mainstream Britons will come to embrace or even have a basic understanding of them, despite the fact that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is married to a Mexican businesswoman who actively campaigns for him. The relative indifference of Mayor Sadiq Khan to the upheaval at Latin Village, and a similar project planned for Elephant and Castle, London’s other major Latinx district, is disappointing anti-gentrification activists in a way eerily similar to New York activists’ reaction to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s coziness with real estate developers. Evictions of Latin Village tenants have already begun.
“When you see how the council assists the developers from the beginning, when this community that’s underfunded with limited resources, we’re always having to play catch-up before we go into court,” said Stefanie Alvarez, a barrister in training whose mother, Vicki, is one of Latin Village’s most active defenders.” Alvarez, whose cousin Manuella appears in “More Than Other,” has a cautious yet optimistic view of the future.
Maybe that’s because of what she sees when she looks across the Atlantic at her original Latinx forebears in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and beyond. “I’m so inspired by what’s happening in America,” said Alvarez, “like the women’s collective Latina Rebels and that councilwoman, what’s her name? Ocasio-Cortez? When you see Latin American women do that it’s really empowering.”"

What it’s like to be Latinx and in publishing in the wake of ‘American Dirt’
By Michelle Herrera Mulligan

When it was released in January, Jeanine Cummins’s novel “American Dirt” was promoted as a socially important examination of the border crisis — until critics and authors began to dissect Cummins’s inauthentic portrayal of Mexican society and her obsessive focus on the trauma of migrants. As a result, the novel’s social significance now comes from the conversations about why she and the book got so hyped in the first place: Who gets to write about underrepresented people? How much are these stories worth? How can we promote them responsibly?
It’s a good thing that these questions are now standard where they once were rare. But as an editor and author who has worked in magazine and book publishing for more than 20 years, this moment feels somewhat anticlimactic. It’s important that figures such as Oprah Winfrey are hosting the discussions, as she did after facing criticism for choosing “American Dirt” for her bestseller-generating book club. But we already know what has to change for the publishing industry to hire and retain editors of color and make sure great writers get the book deals and the attention they deserve. A recent Lee & Low Books survey of publishing industry professionals found that only 6 percent of people who work in publishing identify as Latinx.
One major barrier to entry is publishing-industry salaries. Depending on the national salary aggregator you look at, editorial assistant jobs, the typical entry point to an editing career, pay an average of $36,534 or $43,761. It’s almost impossible to live on that salary in New York, where many publishing industry jobs are concentrated, without outside financial help. That poses a significant obstacle to some aspiring Latino or Latina editors and other job applicants of color.
And getting in the door is just the start. Editors of color are often pulled in multiple directions or forced into no-win scenarios.
To your colleagues you’re often cast in the role of advocate and ambassador. Being one of the few Latina editors in this industry is a lonely, complicated endeavor. I’ve had to fight to prove that books that don’t have easily identified comparative titles in the industry can still be profitable. I also cannot count the number of times I’ve had to explain that Puerto_Ricans are U.S. citizens and don’t identify as “immigrants,” or that the majority of Latino people living in the United States were born here.
To Latin communities, you’re cast as either a resource or a politician. You’re under constant evaluation — judged as either lifting up your communities or being a sellout.
What some advocates don’t understand is that for Latina editors already working in the field, the “conversation” on race and representation in publishing houses is not taking place on the terms we set and may be uncomfortable and exhausting for us. We are doing what we can, in addition to our jobs.
That dynamic has been particularly painful during the conversations about “American Dirt.” Some of the writers who appeared at Winfrey’s town hall have been called “whitetinas” or “vendidas,” meaning sellouts, on social media just for agreeing to appear on the show or to engage with Cummins.
The reality is that those of us representing our communities in publishing will never fulfill any of these roles adequately enough for some outsiders. Most of our time is spent attempting to serve, and make visible, a reader who has been ignored by this industry for decades.
Changing the salary structure and culture in publishing will take time, as will winning the trust of underserved communities. But as the conversations that drive these shifts take place, there are simple steps that all of us inside and outside publishing can do to make things easier for writers and editors of color.
If you are a publisher, stop asking Latina and other editors of color whether their ideas will appeal to a “book-buying audience”; people of color are a book-buying audience. If you are an advocate, start promoting specific, recently published books by people of color on your social media at least once a week, rather than simply waiting to tear down a problematic book by a white author. We need to make sure the great books we all say we want can find the audiences they deserve."

A covid-19 vaccine can ensure better outcomes for communities of color. Let’s work to earn their trust. 
By Bisola O. Ojikutu, Julie H. Levison and Kathryn E. Stephenson

The New England Journal of Medicine reported this month that the covid-19 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 induced robust antibody responses among participants in a clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. With multiple potential vaccines in the pipeline, cautious optimism is emerging that a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine is within reach.
However, as physician-scientists who are invested in improving health among vulnerable populations, we fear that the glimmer of hope ignited by these findings may be short-lived. Even if a safe and effective vaccine is developed, serious problems loom. Surveys indicate that many Americans would not obtain a coronavirus vaccination were it available.The consequences of low participation are all but certain to be grave among people of color, whose vulnerability to the novel coronavirus is high — and whose interest in vaccination is likely to be low. The covid-19 fatality rate among black Americans is more than twice that of whites. Latinx individuals are hospitalized at more than four times the rate of whites.
The Pew Research Center reported last month that 44 percent of black Americans say they would not obtain a covid-19 vaccine (54 percent of black survey respondents said they “would definitely or probably get a coronavirus vaccine if one were available today,"" as would 74 percent of Latinx respondents). Associated Press polling in May found that only 25 percent of black Americans and 37 percent of Latinx individuals would be willing to be vaccinated.
These data are not surprising. Like covid-19, H1N1 “swine flu” resulted in more severe cases among black and Latinx individuals than among whites. Still, anticipated acceptability of the H1N1 vaccine was low, as was actual vaccination, particularly among people of color. Similar disparities have been noted with established vaccines. While 71 percent of white individuals 65 or older obtained pneumococcal vaccine, only 56 percent of black and 49 percent of Latinx individuals have done so in recent years. Vaccination rates for seasonal influenza and human papillomavirus are also disproportionately lower among black and Latinx individuals, who are in high-risk demographic groups.
Reasons for low vaccination rates among people of color include underestimated perceptions of infection risk, general anti-vaccine sentiments and lack of access to health care. For many patients of color, including immigrants, financial concerns are paramount. Out-of-pocket costs, transportation expenses and inability to take time off work are likely to be significant deterrents.Stigma may also thwart vaccination efforts. Any vaccination rollout is likely to prioritize “highest-risk” populations, a characterization that carries baggage. There are widespread, racist assumptions that black and Latinx people living with diabetes and obesity — two conditions that predict severe covid-19 infection — are “poor” and “lazy.” In some communities, “high risk” is code for being less hygienic.
Mistrust is the most insidious challenge. Anti-vaccine sentiments specific to covid-19 are evident among many black Americans, and calls for people of color to have priority access to a new vaccine have been met with suspicion. Vaccine conspiracy theories — such as the now-debunked belief that HIV was spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa via polio vaccine campaigns — have gained footholds in some areas. Beyond conspiracy theories, many people of color can recount stories of how they or someone they know were treated unjustly in a health-care setting. Evidence of structural racism in black and Latinx neighborhoods, including poor-quality hospitals and suboptimal schools, adds to suspicions about interventions promoted by the pharmaceutical industry, researchers or the U.S. government.
Mistrust contributes to underutilization of health-care services in communities where health outcomes are already poor. Without trust, covid-19 vaccines will go unused. Trust must be earned. Here are six steps to begin that process:
Include people of color in all phases of vaccine development, from the scientific team to vaccine administrators. Efforts to distribute a covid-19 vaccine among black and Latinx populations should be led by people from those communities.
Be transparent about the vaccine development process and safety data. All studies should be published in peer-reviewed journals before the vaccine is widely distributed. Articulate clear messages. A vaccine campaign needs to be widely implemented now. Trusted sources should be engaged in this effort. The messenger is as important as the message. Protect people from potential harm. If a vaccine licensed for “emergency use” causes more harm than anticipated, people need assurances that they won’t shoulder undue medical costs. Dismantle all financial barriers to vaccination. This includes not just fees but also flexible clinic hours. Most important, address health inequities and structural racism that have led to the gross racial and ethnic disparities in covid-19 infection and beyond.
Covid-19 caught the world off-guard. But learning from the past can ensure better outcomes. Starting now is the best way to make sure that those who most need a covid-19 vaccine can trust it, afford it, acquire it and be protected by it."

‘Latinx’ not a preferred term among Hispanics, survey says
By Rachel Hatzipanagos

Carlos Diaz, 32, waves a rainbow flag in downtown Orlando in October 2018. The term “Latinx” emerged from the queer Latino community.
Despite the increasing use of “Latinx” in the news media and by some politicians, the gender-neutral word to describe people of Latin American descent is not the preferred term among that group. Less than a quarter, 23 percent, of those who identify as Hispanic or Latino have even heard of the term “Latinx,” a Pew Research Center survey found.
Some groups within those who identify as Latino are more likely to use the term than others, said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of global migration and demography research at Pew.
“Younger people, college-educated Hispanics and notably young Hispanic women were the ones most likely to say that they used the term ‘Latinx’ themselves to describe their identity,” Lopez said.
Overall, “Hispanic” is preferred by a 61 percent majority of people of Latin American descent, followed by “Latino,” which is preferred by 29 percent, Pew found. Left-leaning people seemed to be more likely to have heard the term “Latinx.”
The term Hispanic first appeared in a full U.S. census in 1980 and Latino in 2000, after some in the community resisted the Hispanic label and its connection to Spain.
“Awareness of the term is relatively low. And it speaks to the relative newness of ‘Latinx’ as a pan-ethnic term for this population compared to, say, ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Latino,’ ” Lopez said.
“Latinx” has emerged within a larger push in Latin America to make Spanish and other romance languages gender-neutral. In an open-ended question in the Pew survey that asked respondents what the term means to them, 12 percent said ‘Latinx’ is a term they disagree with or dislike, some describing it as an “Anglicism” of the Spanish language.
Criticisms of “Latinx” are not new, with debates on Twitter erupting every few months. Some argue, inaccurately, that “Latinx” originated from White, non-Hispanic academics.
David Bowles, a Mexican American author and an associate professor of literature at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, said he wasn’t surprised at the survey results because of how slowly language evolves, especially when it comes from a marginalized group.
“‘Latinx’ is definitely the term that has arisen from the queer community,” Bowles said. “Those are the people that were feeling the need for a term that would stop breaking the world into gender binary.”
Bowles, who is bisexual, says he suspects some of the visceral resistance to using ‘Latinx’ may be tied to a larger homophobic sentiment in the Latino community.
“It’s nonsense they can use to, in my view, cover up this anti-LGBTQ sentiment,” Bowles said.
Bowles also points out that those who prefer to use ‘Latinx’ as a larger pan-ethnic label are not imposing the term on other individuals — he primarily identifies as Mexican American or Chicano, with Latino as a secondary label. Like the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino” before it, “Latinx” may just be the latest in the evolving process of language.
“Language has been evolving since the very first time we ever figured out how to say words,” Bowles said. “And it will continue to evolve.” "

Americans overwhelmingly oppose school reopenings, data finds
Analysis by Jonathan E. Collins and Sally A. Nuamah

Black and Latinx Americans are especially worried about reopenings — but are also worried about their children falling behind.For perhaps the first time in recent history, every school district across the nation is seriously considering the question of whether their institutions should physically reopen in the fall, given the risk of spreading the coronavirus. President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have called for schools to physically reopen. These public declarations have brought mass resistance from K-12 teachers, with many threatening to strike if forced to enter the classroom.
Many teachers are concerned that reopened schools will further spread covid-19. Others worry that Black, Latinx and low-income students will be further disadvantaged by the potential learning losses associated with instruction online only.
The stakes are high and the debate has been highly politicized. Our research asked: What do ordinary Americans think about schools reopening? How does race shape these attitudes?
Here is what we discovered.Americans don’t want schools to reopen
Between July 30 and Aug. 1, we fielded a nationally representative poll of 1,273 U.S. adults with the survey firm Prolific to assess these questions. The vast majority of our respondents, 62 percent, expressed strong opposition to schools reopening. Only 19 percent felt schools should reopen, and the remaining 19 percent said they were undecided.
Those opinions divide more by race and party. Black Americans were the most likely to oppose reopening schools. Seventy percent of Black Americans oppose reopening schools, a jump from the 57 percent of Whites who do. The gap was largest between Democrats and Republicans, with 74 percent of Democrats opposing the reopening, compared with only 35 percent of Republicans.
Americans, particularly Black and Latinx Americans, fear learning losses
At the same time, most Americans worry students will fall behind in school, perhaps even losing what they’ve already learned. When we asked respondents whether they think learning losses from the pandemic shutdowns will affect children of someone like them, 76 percent said yes, it probably will.
Again, that varies strongly by race. While 73 percent of White respondents took this position, 82 percent of Black Americans and 83 percent of Latinx Americans expect their communities’ children to fall behind in learning.
Americans want schools to take precautions
If schools are to reopen, Americans strongly favor implementing precautionary policies to protect against the spread of covid-19. Support for the various precautions is consistently high across racial and ethnic groups. On average, close to 80 percent of the full sample supports frequent and mandatory coronavirus testing. Over 80 percent support keeping students six feet apart at all times. About 85 percent support mandating all students and employees wear masks while in school. Meanwhile, 80 percent support staggering schedules, so at no time would all students be physically present, with some attending on some days and times while others attend at other days and times, leaving more room for social distancing. But the policy idea with the highest level of support — backed by fully 90 percent of respondents — is for students to continue learning remotely, from home.
Again, though, there are partisan differences, with Republicans less likely to support protective measures — even though significant majorities do. When asked about covid-19 testing for school reopenings, 67 percent of Republicans support it; 76 percent support social distancing within schools; 71 percent support mandatory mask-wearing policies; 69 percent support staggering schedules, and 80 percent support allowing students to continue remotely.
Americans trust some leaders more than others on schools and pandemic decisions
We asked respondents how much they trust different political figures to provide accurate information on covid-19. Just over two-thirds (69 percent) expressed “a lot” or at least “some” trust in their city’s mayor. Slightly less than two-thirds (65 percent) extend that level of trust to their state governor. Meanwhile, only 55 percent of respondents said they trusted their local school leaders.Perhaps most interesting, only 24 percent of our sample said they trusted Trump’s information on covid-19. This distrust, though, breaks down along partisan lines, with 72 percent of Republicans saying they trust information from the president compared with just 7 percent of Democrats.
Overall, we find while many citizens have strong reservations about schools reopening, that’s especially true among Black Americans, who also worry that remote instruction will cause Black and Latinx students to fall behind. That’s because Black and Latinx parents in our sample are less likely to have access to a desktop computer or laptop, with 19 percent of Black parents and 18 percent of Latinx parents saying they experience difficulty compared with only 8 percent of White parents.
As covid-19 deaths continue to climb, it is unsurprising the issue of school reopenings has become contentious. With the economic downturn, many adults feel under pressure to return to work — and many, if not most, working parents rely on schools for daytime child care. Further, many American parents rely on schools to provide mental and physical health services, supervised play and physical activity, free meals, and individualized learning plans, all difficult to replace when those schools are physically closed. At the same times, families don’t want to risk their health and their lives for these resources.
Nonetheless, the many debates surrounding school reopenings up to this point have largely focused on the sentiments of school district leaders and teachers, often excluding the everyday Americans most directly affected. Our survey makes their opinions on the matter pretty clear: Most don’t want their schools physically reopened. Time will reveal whether school district leaders take their side."

A journey across America to explore the heart of the Latinx community
Review by Ed Morales

Paola Ramos writes that the term “Latinx” set free “the parts of myself that had deviated from the norms and traditions of the Latino culture I grew up in.By now, it seems almost everyone has had an encounter with “Latinx,” the newish label that many people of Latin American descent in the United States have been using to describe themselves. Objections to it have been rampant, from those who see only its unpronounceable non-Spanishness (Latinks?) and those who say it erases Black and Indigenous people. Then there are those who believe in its power of inclusion, that the X, rather than marking the spot, maps the intersection of everything we are: Black/White, straight/gay, Anglo/Latino, Eastern/Western and beyond.
In her new book, “Finding Latinx: In Search of the Voices Redefining Latino Identity,” Vice News/Telemundo/MSNBC correspondent Paola Ramos tries to put a human face on a debate so far dominated by academics and identity politicians. It’s a personal story for her, as she reveals early on, a coming-out tale that is firmly intertwined with the emergence of the Latino community as a whole.
Ramos’s sense of being Latino began problematically: In high school, watching her father, high-profile Univision newscaster Jorge Ramos, on the set with “women who appeared to have just finished a Latin American beauty pageant” led her to question her identity as a “Latina.” After many years of introspection, she began using the term “Latinx” after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, feeling that the X set free “the parts of myself that had deviated from the norms and traditions of the Latino culture I grew up in in a way that, interestingly, made me closer to, not further from, my own community.”With this newfound ability to redefine herself, she became determined to paint a portrait of a largely misunderstood “community.” Recent debate on the nature of the Latino vote, for instance, has led many observers to question whether a fragmented ethno-racial group from 21 different countries even coheres as a political and cultural identity. So, in the spirit of the American road movie, “Finding Latinx” sets off on a journey crisscrossing the United States, looking for the heart of Latinx.
The chapters of Ramos’s book read a little like the structure of a short news documentary — she sets the scene in a place like the Central Valley of California by describing lush fields of fruits, nuts and vegetables, only to reveal the danger that the pesticides used to keep crops fresh pose for the workers who harvest them. Her portraits of subjects such as Byanka Santoyo, an environmental-justice activist, and Mónica Ramírez, who wrote a piece for Time magazine revealing sexual abuse of female farmworkers, have journalistic rigor, while slowly building an emotional connection with the book’s central idea about a generation coming of age.
Ramos’s interview subjects are often from the queer community, but she also engages with debates about Latinx racial identity and the criticism that “Latinidad” — an idealization of shared Latino cultural traits increasingly seen as superficial — privileges lighter-skinned people, even if they are apparently of mixed race. Black Latinx often face a double bind in the United States and Latin America: “Too black to be Latina and too Latina to be black.” Her interviews with the Afro-Colombian Ilia Calderón, Jorge Ramos’s co-anchor at Univision, and Leyanis Díaz, an Afro-Cuban from Miami, succinctly capture their grace under pressure.Combining her acuity as a political staffer (she worked for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016) with her bilingual journalistic skill, she sketches barely known Mayan immigrant communities in Georgia and South Carolina, meditating on the principle of K’exel, which, Ramos tells us, “refers to the idea that when humans physically perish, their traits don’t leave the earth. . . . In other words, your spirit never dies.” She uncovers the irony, through one subject in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, that health care, including abortion and birth control, is better on the Mexican side of the border.
Ramos’s itinerary is impressively wide-ranging, including areas where you would expect to find the Latinx story as well as unexpected ones. In Poughkeepsie, N.Y., about 50 miles north of Manhattan, Ramos finds a community of Mexicans from Oaxaca who revived the downtown after destruction from a forgotten riot by locals after the 1992 Rodney King verdict. Back on the border, she revels in the little-told stories of Cubans who came to the United States by crossing from Mexico after the wet-foot/dry-foot policy was ended during the Obama administration. That policy allowed Cuban migrants who arrived on dry land without a visa to become permanent residents, while those intercepted at sea would be repatriated.
While Ramos’s Mexican father is well-known, her mother happens to be a Cuban immigrant, something that makes the author’s embrace of mixed-ness sensical while also propelling her to make connections outside of both her ethnic identities. But for all its broad investigation, one of the book’s most compelling sections is the retrospective on her hometown, Miami. She describes the strangeness of how blithely her high school friends engaged with Latinidad, an understandable attitude in the bilingual milieu of a city that is 70 percent Latino, hardly a center of marginalization.
In this chapter, she takes the bold step of interviewing Enrique Tarrio, an Afro-Cuban Miami denizen who happens to be the chairman of the right-wing extremist group Proud Boys, which Trump infamously name-checked during his rancorous first debate with Joe Biden. She explains Tarrio’s seemingly contradictory position as head of a group with white-supremacist ties as a product of his internalization of his parents’ trauma of exile, his embrace of Trump’s macho street sense, and a desperate play for acceptance and belonging in a polarized America.
While Ramos does not accept Tarrio’s extremism, she concludes that he is entitled to build his own narrative. “And that, in and of itself, is a Latinx story,” she writes.
I imagine that the downside of embracing the fluidity of “being Latino” is an acceptance of borderless, never-ending variation, or as the late Mexican American writer Gloria Anzaldúa would say, a “tolerance for contradiction.” Still, for me, part of the great promise of Latinx identity is its power to act as an antidote to authoritarianism, which seeks to scapegoat and demonize difference.
There’s no doubt that “Finding Latinx” artfully accomplishes its goal of defining Latinidad as a chance to create political and cultural coalitions in a way that recognizes common struggles, and the growing importance of the way those struggles thrive in that intersection. While pundits have spent considerable energy casting doubt on such a goal as the project of the elite, Ramos firmly grounds it in the voices of young, committed, everyday people who are just beginning to be heard."

‘Latinx’ hasn’t even caught on among Latinos. It never will.
Perspective by Jose A. Del Real

The term is an English-language contrivance, not a real gesture at gender inclusivity.The term “Latinx,” modifying “Latino” and “Latina” to describe people in a gender-inclusive way, has become commonplace — in some quarters. Opponents of transphobia and sexism leaven their social media posts, academic papers and workplace Slack chats with the term. Liberal politicians use it. Civil rights litigators use it. Social scientists use it. Public health experts like Anthony Fauci use it. Merriam-Webster added it to the dictionary in 2018. But the label has not won wide adoption among the 61 million people of Latin American descent living in the United States. Only about 1 in 4 Latinos in the United States are familiar with the term, according to an August Pew Research Center survey. Just 3 percent identify themselves that way. Even politically liberal Latinos aligned with the broad cultural goals of the left are often reluctant to use it.
This disjunction is the subject of intense, often confused, debate. Users of “Latinx” are accused of being out of touch with working-class Latino communities and of practicing linguistic imperialism on the Spanish language, which, like French and Italian, is grammatically gendered. And the term’s opponents are often called transphobic, anti-LGBT and “machista” — chauvinist.
The opposition to “Latinx” is often quotidian: The -x is hard to say in Spanish. Its plural derivatives, like “latinxs” and “amigxs” and “tixs,” are impossible to pronounce. For Spanish speakers navigating nonbinary gender in their day-to-day lives, the -x modification does not provide a road map for dealing with pronouns (el/ella) or gendered articles (el/la, un/una) in spoken Spanish. This English-language modification to Spanish-language grammar does not achieve linguistically what it hopes to achieve culturally: an expansive recognition of autonomy and difference that people can use in everyday life.
Spanish has witnessed several innovations to make it more inclusive. A growing number of LGBTQ communities here and abroad use “Latine” (la-tee-neh). Not only does it sound much less awkward in Spanish than “Latinx,” but the -e can be applied to other words in verbal Spanish very easily, in lieu of the masculine -o or the feminine -a. The gender-neutral pronoun “elle” (pronounced: ey-eh) has become a popular modification for “el” (he) and “ella” (she) when the person being identified is nonbinary. None of these has caught on in the United States, even as “Latinx” has become more common in news headlines, official public health communiques, medical discussions, corporate emails and glossy Instagram posts by social influencers.  Meanwhile, domestic American politics have subsumed the debate over “Latinx.” This fall’s election highlighted the nuanced political leanings of 30 million voters of Latin American descent, about 1 in 3 of whom nationally voted to reelect President Trump. Political preferences and calculations within this group vary widely based on where people live, as well as their ancestry, faith, age, gender, education, income and other variables.
Nevertheless, some strategists and journalists argue that progressives’ embrace of “Latinx” lost some votes among Latino communities in Florida and Texas by imposing a label on people who do not use it to describe themselves. (The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and its members appear to rarely use the term in statements to their constituents.) But that explanation ignores more easy-to-prove causes, including the absence of early and sustained investment by Democratic campaigns in the Latino communities of Florida and the Texas borderlands. Democrats, by contrast, fared far better in states like Arizona and Nevada, where grass-roots Mexican American advocates have built effective political mobilization efforts.
If these constituencies are so different from one another, some have even asked if it is a mistake to use a single label to encompass all people of Latin American descent. The push for a pan-ethnic label began in earnest in the late 1960s and 1970s. From the Northeast to the Southwest, Puerto_Rican and Mexican American community leaders recognized shared social problems — including poverty and inadequate investment in their schools — but were often told by federal authorities that they lacked data to substantiate their requests for federal funding. Prominent Latino leaders and academics began to lobby the U.S. Census Bureau to create a category that would include them — and thus measure disparities on a scale of statistical significance. “Hispanic” appeared for the first time on the census in 1980, says G. Cristina Mora, the author of “Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American.”
“Hispanic” soon had detractors. By the 1990s, a growing consensus among academics and activists held that the term obscured the legacy of colonization and genocide by Spain. “Latino” emerged as a preferred pan-ethnic identifier, and in 2000 it was added to the census alongside “Hispanic.” (The “race” of Hispanics/Latinos is a fraught topic, because the census does not recognize the common Latin American racial category of mestizo, which denotes a mix of European and Indigenous ancestry.)“Latinx” is the latest twist in this saga. It began to circulate on the Internet around the turn of the century, primarily through chat spaces and early forms of social media, adopted first by queer-identifying people of Latin American descent. Since 2015, young people have embraced it with particular exuberance, especially in university settings.
Where and by whom “Latinx” is used has helped spur the complaints that it may alienate working-class Latino communities (especially those that speak Spanish) or at least fail to reflect their preferences. “I keep thinking, people who are watching this, do they identify with that term?” asks Richard T. Rodríguez, an associate professor at the University of California at Riverside, of political messaging during the pandemic that has used “Latinx.” “The x is jarring, kind of like biting in glass.” (Rodríguez also pointed out that even though “Latinx” is often used in solidarity with the trans community, a transgender person who has fought for his or her gender identity to be publicly recognized can also be marginalized by the term.)
Today, surveys show that people of Latin American ancestry in the United States often prefer to describe themselves by referencing their specific countries of heritage, according to a 2019 Pew survey. For second-generation Americans of Latino descent, country of heritage is used equally often as “Hispanic” or “Latino,” according to the survey. And those nationalities are not gendered in English.But surveys that ask participants to choose a single identifier miss the extent to which people of Latin American descent often “code switch,” depending on who they are talking to, says Mora. Someone can identify as Mexican American and Latino, Cuban American and Hispanic, Nicaraguan American and Latinx, and any configuration therein. Mora adds that “Latinx” is more common in California than in other parts of the country. “I certainly identify as Chicana, as Latina, and I use ‘Latinx’ often. And that coincides with the data I’ve seen. It’s not mutually exclusive, and we have a right to do that,” she says. “We are one of the most dynamic groups of the country. We are continually contending with ourselves, and that’s absolutely fine.”
And when in doubt about how people identify, she advises, just ask them."

Talented Black and Latinx students like us are now being shut out of Thomas Jefferson High School
By Daniel I. Morales and Fabianna Del Canto

We got into Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology because of affirmative action. We graduated in the top 10 percent of the TJ class of 1998 and went on, between us, to earn degrees from Harvard, Williams College and Yale Law School. We have thriving careers in academia and technology. The TJ of the 1990s saw our potential and nurtured it, even though neither of us had the perfect grades, test scores and carefully honed polish that TJ admissions now demands. Without the nudge TJ gave us, we might never have achieved our full potential.
We now would be shut out of TJ, and our careers and achievements might well have been stunted as a result. Our parents are immigrants who cared deeply about our educations and found opportunities for us in Fairfax County gifted programs, but navigating today’s TJ admissions gantlet would certainly have been beyond them. Even without perfect grooming, the more generous TJ of the 1990s took these factors into account and gave us a boost when we needed it.That hasn’t been true for decades, and Fairfax County and the country are more impoverished for the change. Studies show that elite educations benefit racial minorities from modest family backgrounds the most, and that talented members of these groups routinely overperform their standardized tests. Kids whose parents have advanced degrees are going to do just as well if they go to McLean or Chantilly (or Sidwell or Georgetown Day) as they would if they went to TJ. But for kids like us, TJ is a game changer. Now, they don’t get the opportunities we did, and that keeps us up at night.
A radical group of TJ parents and community members filed a lawsuit against Fairfax County to preserve the admissions test at TJ, the same test that has excluded a generation of Black and Latinx students from attending TJ and getting the life-changing education we received. The underlying premise of this group’s claim about TJ admissions is that it shouldn’t change because it already perfectly identifies all the available talent in Northern Virginia — 13-year-old Black and Latinx students these days just don’t have the chops, they imply. We think that’s absurd, statistically improbable (thanks for the stats curriculum, TJ!) and racist.
If current admissions to TJ perfectly spots talent, as the Coalition for TJ claims, then that means there are no more than a handful of Black and Latinx students in the four counties from which TJ draws who have the talent to benefit from an elite education. Even if you think inherent ability is skewed toward the top of the socioeconomic ladder (a proposition for which there is little evidence), there have to be at least hundreds of Black and Latinx kids in the area who could thrive at TJ. Almost none of these kids is being admitted. Elite colleges such as those we attended have discovered this missing talent and changed their admissions accordingly. Why can’t TJ? As a public school that serves the public good, TJ has an obligation to find these kids and bring them into the fold, not to preserve a status quo that has shut them out.The final fallacy being peddled by defenders of the status quo is that a change in admissions is “anti-Asian.” We find this line the most disheartening. When multiracial democracy is under attack by white supremacists, Asian Americans are being killed or harassed every day and our former president used all the powers at his disposal to keep out non-White immigrants of all religions and creeds, non-White peoples have to listen to each other’s voices and work together. This moment is an opportunity for Black, Latinx and Asian people to make common cause and fight injustice hand in hand. Making room at the table for talented Black and Latinx kids is about basic fairness. Casting equity efforts as “anti-Asian” plays right into white supremacists’ hands, and every person of color is the worse for that.
Black and Latinx kids who are just as talented as their Asian and White brothers and sisters are not getting into TJ, and that is not okay in 2021 — 23 years after we graduated. That some TJ parents and community members don’t want to make room for these kids breaks our hearts.
We support the Fairfax County Public School Board’s efforts to diversify TJ, and we condemn the lawsuit designed to bring that process to a halt. We hope that many local parents out there agree with us and call the school board and their state representatives to let them know that they support efforts to make room at TJ for talented Black and Latinx kids like us."

He couldn’t afford a console. Now he’s designing games.
By Rachel Hatzipanagos

As a teen growing up in Mexico City, Fernando Reyes Medina played “Halo” at an Internet cafe with his friends. He couldn’t afford a console of his own.
Now, Reyes Medina is playing a key role in developing the latest chapter in the franchise, “Halo Infinite,” a title that is key to the new Xbox console’s success.
“It’s definitely a dream come true,” Reyes Medina, 29, said. “And it’s a big responsibility and overwhelming at times.”
For Reyes Medina, who is a senior multiplayer designer for Microsoft’s 343 Industries studio, the road to becoming a game developer was a challenge. He first had to teach himself English because many of the materials used to learn computer programming aren’t available in his native Spanish. Once he was able to get his foot in the door, he also faced issues working in a predominantly White non-Hispanic field.
It was challenging to make the personal connections necessary to get ahead at work, because — in an environment where Medina was one of few Latinos — it was difficult to find people he could relate to. His co-workers shared the same taste in music and would bond over concerts and other things that didn’t interest him.
“There were so many barriers that I faced that weren’t necessarily attributed to my skills as a game developer,” Reyes Medina said. “I was talking with some other of my friends in the community who are also Latinos, and we shared similar challenges … we didn’t want people to have to go through the same things.”
So, along with a few other Latinx developers, he founded Latinx in Gaming, a nonprofit that provides training and networking opportunities. During Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from Sept. 15 through Friday, the group is holding special workshops on Twitch that incorporate cooking tortillas with career advice. It comes at a time when the gaming industry is reflecting on its culture after California labor regulators sued video game giant Activision Blizzard over allegations that the company discriminated against female employees. Now, developers of color also want more attention paid to racial disparities in the industry, and how racism and sexism may intersect to create toxic work environments.
Nine percent of game developers identified as Hispanic in a 2021 voluntary survey by the industry trade group the International Game Developers Association (IGDA). Of the 803 respondents, two-thirds identified as White, 7 percent East Asian and 4 percent Black. The same survey found that 61 percent of respondents were men, 30 percent women and 8 percent nonbinary, gender fluid, genderqueer or two-spirited.
About Us spoke with Reyes Medina about the state of Latinos in the gaming industry. His answers have been edited for clarity and length. Q: What do you think are the consequences of not having many Latinos in gaming?
A: There’s definitely less representation of Latino culture in the medium. And I think that I see a big opportunity, and it just seems weird that as Latinos, our food is unique, our dancing, our music … we’re very good at [celebrating] culture. But as far as games today, there’s nothing like that. The identity of the Latino game is nonexistent. You can identify a Japanese game. You can identify a Western American game. They have very specific attributes and properties to them, from the stories they tell to how they communicate. And there’s nothing like that for Latinos. It’s such a unique medium that we can use to tell our stories and to pass on our stories. I think that the fact that there’s not a lot of us making them is creating a barrier. Because other people are not going to be aware of all the amazing stories that we have. Q: What are some things about the culture of game development that make it difficult for Latinos to break in? A: A lot of the industry has very bad practices in terms of hiring or promotion, where you get hired because you know somebody or there’s certain special treatment for your friends, and it’s hard for an outsider to break in. So the fact that our industry is so homogenous makes it harder to be different and to really be part of the team, and that affects us more the further you move up in your career. I think that has a bigger impact in terms of getting to leadership positions or even getting funding to start your own company … It’s so subtle and so subjective that unless you are experiencing it, it is really hard to see.
Q: Can you think of any games at the moment that are being made that stand out to you in terms of representing the community?
A: The first one I can think of is “Aztech,” which is made by a studio in Mexico. They are developing a sci-fi adventure game, which is a very interesting concept. I think that there’s also an opportunity for a developer from the Latino community to create something that isn’t necessarily telling a Latino story. There’s another game called “Greak: Memories of Azur,” which is a fantasy game, and it’s made by a Latino team. … It’s just a game, but you can see the culture seeping through it because of how we approach storytelling and how we approach art or music. Q: What are your goals going forward with Latinx in Gaming?
A: We want to increase our reach to Latin America. We are a very U.S.-based organization, primarily because we know that this is where the resources are and this is where the companies are. But my dream is to have local chapters of Latinx in Gaming in each one of the countries that are autonomous and they just connect to the bigger organization so they can help locally. Right now, we have a vision of having … local community leaders that can help us understand what the challenges are in each one of the countries. Because the industry is very different in each one of them.
Q: Was there a specific game that got you interested in becoming a developer?
A: I mean, definitely “Halo.” When you’re playing a game online like that, all the barriers of the real world stop existing and everybody’s the same. I think that’s super cool. And I think that that’s a very, very powerful thing. And the moment I noticed that, I was like, this is the thing I want to do with my life. I love games. But [my path] was really, really hard. It shouldn’t be that hard."

University of Maryland to create 5 new cultural centers for underrepresented students
By Lauren Lumpkin

The University of Maryland at College Park will open five new cultural centers for underrepresented students, the campus’s president announced.
Darryll J. Pines assumed the university’s presidency in July 2020 with promises to foster diversity and inclusion on the campus of more than 40,000 students. In the year-plus since, U-Md. officials have opened a newly renovated Muslim prayer space, pledged $40 million to hire and support underrepresented faculty, and, most recently, named a dining hall to honor the state’s Piscataway Conoy Tribe. The school also welcomed a majority-minority freshman class this year.
Pines said during his State of the Campus address Wednesday that students and officials next will create new cultural centers for Latino, Asian Pacific Islander Desi American, Native American and Indigenous, and multiracial and biracial student groups, as well as for students with disabilities.“The impact of cultural centers is unequivocal,” Pines, Vice President for Student Affairs Patty Perillo and Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Georgina Dodge said in a message to the campus. “They help students feel validated and uplifted by recognizing their cultural knowledge and assets and give them the tools to navigate some of the challenges they might face both in and outside of the classroom.”
The announcement of the centers is the culmination of meetings between administrators and “communities that have experienced exclusion and underrepresentation,” Pines, Perillo and Dodge said. Fewer than 1 percent of students at U-Md. are from American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander backgrounds; 19 percent are Asian; 10 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino; and 5 percent say they are two or more races, federal data shows. Officials did not announce an opening date for the cultural centers, which will be housed in Cole Field House, an athletics facility. But Pines, Perillo and Dodge said university leaders and students will begin planning and designing the spaces this month. Community hubs already exist on campus for Black students and students from the LGBTQ+ community, but those from other underrepresented groups have been fighting for spaces of their own, said Kislay Parashar, U-Md.'s student body president.
“After covid and a year-and-a-half of virtual [learning], we haven’t gotten as much interaction with students, in general, and specifically with students of our own communities,” said Parashar, who is Indian. “The university is a big place,” he noted, and such spaces allow minority students “to embrace your own culture, and you get to talk to people of similar backgrounds as you.”
Research indicates that cultural hubs help minority students better adjust to life in college and develop their identities. Other campuses throughout the country have designated spaces for students based on race, ability, gender, religion and a host of other identities. “These spaces help students to be successful and thrive by better supporting their acclimation to university life and developing greater cultural awareness, allowing them to feel part of community and know that they matter,” Pines, Perillo and Dodge said.
The creation of these cultural centers, they added, are part of an ongoing effort “to acknowledge the University of Maryland’s role throughout its history in denying access and full participation, and take actions to advance diversity, equity and inclusion.”"

Use of ‘Latinx’ is low on the list of what Democrats should be nervous about with Hispanic voters
Analysis by Philip Bump

One of the challenges with American politics is that it distills all of the complexity of human concerns and priorities and emotion into an A-or-B decision. Your 60 years on this planet, your family relationships, your work history, your religion, your neighborhood, your aspirations — has this made you a Donald Trump person or a Joe Biden person? Check the proper box and move on with your life.
This is less frustrating to you than it is to the people tasked with influencing which of those boxes you will choose. If my job is to get you to vote for Trump or for Republicans in the future, I need to figure out which of those factors that contribute to who you are is the thing that has the greatest chance of convincing you to vote that way at the lowest cost in resources including time and energy.
And, of course, money. Campaigns spend a lot of money to convince people who to vote for, and there is an entire industry built around getting those campaigns to spend that money in particular ways. If, for example, you run a local television station, you are going to want to make the strongest case possible to a presidential campaign that running ads on local television is the best way to convince those voters or get them to turn out to vote. If you are Twitter, you are going to offer an alternative viewpoint.
That scramble over money is just the most obvious way in which candidates and campaigns and parties are pulled in different directions. There are also clear ideological and rhetorical fights that pit factions against one another, generally with the same outcome of maximizing votes. In the wake of the 2020 election, for example, there was a fight among Democrats about the extent to which leftist rhetoric on policing hampered the party’s efforts to appeal to voters.
There was also a more potent fight over the rightward shift of Hispanic voters in the presidential contest. Democratic strength nationally depends to a significant extent on robust support from non-White voters now and over the long term. If that support softens, it threatens the party’s political position. Thus, there’s been another swirl of conversation centered on how and why that softening occurred and how to prevent it from happening in the future.
One thing that’s safe to say didn’t play a huge role in that shift was the use of the descriptor “Latinx” instead of “Hispanic” or “Latino.”
You’re probably familiar with “Latinx.” If not, The Washington Post’s Jose A. Del Real wrote about it last year, explaining that the term is meant to serve the same function as “Latino” but without the gender specificity of the -o suffix (as opposed to the -a in Latina). The term was embraced by many on the political left — but by no means everyone.
On Monday, Politico reported on a survey conducted by the Democratic consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi International. That survey determined that very few Latinos identify as “Latinx,” as opposed to “Hispanic” or “Latino/a” and that 4 in 10 say that use of the term bothers them to at least some extent. Three in 10 voters said that use of that term would make them less likely to vote for that candidate for office.
The survey is a very good distillation of the way in which small parts of broad conversations can be weaponized as part of the discourse over winning elections. Those data “suggest that using Latinx is a violation of the political Hippocratic oath, which is to first do no electoral harm,” one of the firm’s founders told Politico, suggesting that the Democratic Party was shooting itself in the foot by using it.
There might be things that Democrats should worry about less than what this poll says about Hispanic voters, but I’m not sure what.
Other polling reinforces the idea that even most Hispanic Americans don’t use the term Latinx. Pew Research Center, for example, found similarly that only 3 percent of Hispanics use it. But there’s so much cant around the Bendixen & Amandi polling that it’s hard to treat its findings as particularly significant — much less worthy of incorporating into broad discussions of outreach to Hispanic voters.
For example, despite the inclusion of party and age breakdowns, the Bendixen & Amandi poll results weren’t actually weighted. The survey was conducted online and by phone from a database of registered voters, with 800 interviews among those whom identified their ethnicity or heritage as Hispanic, Latino, Latina, Latinx or who named a Hispanic country or territory as their place of origin. That lack of weighting, though, means that the stated differences in responses between Democrats and Republicans shouldn’t necessarily be considered representative of the Hispanic population nationally.
A particularly dubious finding from the survey is the one that seems most directly applicable to the question of influencing Hispanic voters: the group that said they would be less likely to support a candidate using that term. Such questions lead to notoriously wonky results, as CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy has pointed out. We treat the question as pointing in one direction — I have view X, so I vote Y — when it’s often pointing the other way, with the Y vote leading to the X view. At one point, she found that 11 percent of Trump voters said they were more likely to support him based on how he ordered his steak.
The finding that 40 percent take issue with the term (though a more modest 20 percent said they were bothered by it “a lot”) reminded me of another poll that Politico covered. In that one, the pollsters found that a plurality of Americans thought “cancel culture” had “gone too far” — a finding that makes sense when you consider that the common association with “cancel culture” is that it’s used as a pejorative to disparage leftist rhetoric and behavior. “Cancel culture” has been used to describe something in a negative way and, subsequently, “cancel culture” is viewed negatively. Use of “Latinx” is not as widespread, but one might assume that those whom are familiar with it similarly identify it with a political viewpoint.
The point here is not that Democrats should insist upon use of the term Latinx despite it not being embraced by Hispanics. It is, instead, that eliding the term from the left’s vocabulary will not fix the challenge the party may face with Hispanic voters. If we consider “Latinx” as a proxy for “How White leftists think America should talk about race,” we get slightly closer.
The short-term concern is that Black and Hispanic Democrats are less likely to identify as liberal than White Democrats. It seems clear that the Trump campaign’s rhetoric attempting to tie President Biden to socialism last year helped drive down Biden’s numbers in Florida, but even besides that, Hispanics are more moderate than Democrats overall. The General Social Survey found in 2018 that two-thirds of White Democrats identify as liberal, compared with 37 percent of Black Americans and 29 percent of Hispanics. In the American National Election Study conducted last year, only 44 percent of non-White Democrats over the age of 45 identified as liberal, compared with 62 percent of all Democrats in that age group. The long-term concern is whether this divide leads to a shift in partisan identity and voting.
The Democratic Party does need to figure out how to prevent erosion from its Hispanic supporters, but that’s a broad conversation about how people apply their life experiences and desired outcomes to checking a box on a ballot. It seems unlikely that using the term “Latinx” earned the Democrats any votes it wouldn’t otherwise have won. It seems unlikely, too, that using the term cost them any votes they would have otherwise received. This debate, then, seems most likely to be one of the swirling eddies that spins out of conversations about what happened in elections and what will happen in elections moving forward."

The debate over ‘Latinx’ highlights a broader problem for Democrats
By Megan McArdle

A majority of such voters say they prefer the already gender-neutral “Hispanic” over ""Latinx,"" according to a Pew Research Center poll.
Monday saw the release of yet another poll showing that the term “Latinx” is unpopular among Hispanic voters — only 2 percent preferred to use it, while 40 percent found it off-putting and 30 percent said they’d be less likely to vote for a politician who deployed it. Naturally, the rest of the week was spent arguing over how much this mattered.
The term has been growing in popularity lately, often used by White politicians or columnists like myself who want to politely defer to another group’s preferences. But it appears that Latinx is not, in fact, what that group wants to be called; a majority of them say they prefer the already gender-neutral “Hispanic.”
This seems particularly relevant as Hispanics have begun deserting Democrats for the GOP (a Wall Street Journal poll out this week showed them evenly split between the parties). One potential culprit is the kind of progressivism that Latinx represents — hyperfocused on language policing and divisive identity issues rather than bread-and-butter policy. But one can also argue, as New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie did, that the critics are the ones displaying a professional wordsmith’s fixation on minor word choices, rather than the substantive issues that actually decide elections.
Yet this in turn invites an obvious retort: If word choice is such a minor matter, why does this graceless and unbeloved neologism keep showing up in newspaper headlines and stump speeches? And the obvious answer — to keep peace with other parts of the progressive coalition — in fact points us toward a growing problem for Democrats and the left.
Over the years, elite American institutions have grown more and more scrupulous about achieving certain kinds of demographic representation — particularly those that lean left. That’s something for which they should be applauded because America’s elites need to look like America.
But whatever rainbow hues of race and sexual orientation are visible in the group photos, American elites across the political spectrum are actually becoming less representative in one way: Most of them hold college degrees, and many also have advanced degrees, often from highly selective institutions.The college-educated are only about a third of the population, so they cannot build a durable majority without wooing other voters into the fold. With educational polarization rising — and older dividing lines like race beginning to fade — the left cannot afford to forget just how different educated people are from whatever demographic group they are supposed to represent.
On average, the interests, values and concerns of college-educated women differ significantly from those who aren’t — and the more exclusive their education, the bigger the gap. The same is likely to be true of basically any major demographic category you’d care to name: race, immigration status, sexual orientation or gender identity.
Of course there are commonalities that the college-educated can still speak to — women with doctorate degrees worry about unwanted pregnancies and sexual assault, as do working-class women. But that doesn’t mean women with college degrees can effectively represent the broader voices of “women” when issues arise in the boardroom, editorial meeting or campaign strategy session.
Educated voices often focus on aspects of common problems that are unique to themselves — witness how much coverage of sexual assault focuses on college campuses, even though college women do not appear to be at higher risk than their non-college peers. Or consider how much pro-choice rhetoric concentrates on disruptions to education or career, which may not be the top concerns of a high school dropout.
Consider, too, that the dropout is actually less likely to support liberal abortion laws than the graduate — something you wouldn’t necessarily glean from listening to her educated counterparts talking about what “women” think.
And so too with “Latinx.” College-educated people of any ethnicity are noticeably further left on social issues, better able to keep abreast of constantly shifting language norms, and more likely to work and socialize with the professionals who use such language. So college-educated Hispanics are probably quite a bit more comfortable with “Latinx” than working-class Hispanics are. They’re also the ones likely to be sitting at the table when an institution or a politician decides to use it.
By itself, that’s relatively harmless. A 2019 Pew Research Center poll showed that fewer than 1 in 4 Hispanics had even heard the term, so I doubt it’s moving many votes today. But these sorts of problems also show up in policy — which might be how both political parties decided that ultraliberal immigration policy was the key to the Hispanic vote.
Turns out Hispanics’ views on immigration are complicated, and relatively few of them rank the issue as their biggest worry. That might have been clear had the educated people consulted working-class Hispanic voters rather than their college-educated peers or their imaginations. While it may not matter what bespoke terms the left invents to please this or that constituency, it matters a great deal to whom they are talking — and to whom they listen before they start to speak."

‘With Love’ is the rare feel-good holiday show that actually feels good
Review by Inkoo Kang

Cookies, fruitcake, gingerbread: The winter holidays are a time for sugary delights — and their TV equivalents.
It’s become de rigueur to complain about how the Christmas season begins earlier every year, but the deluge of Yuletide-themed content tends to precede even the carols blaring on loop over supermarket speakers. Don’t worry, I’m not here to junk-shame anyone; viewers are entitled to enjoy their Hallmark and Lifetime movies in peace, just as they are their sugarplum sweets.
But the abundance of assembly-line bonbons does make a lovingly crafted confection like “With Love” stand out all the more. The artisan behind the five-part Amazon Prime series is Gloria Calderón Kellett, a co-creator of the much-beloved (and much-mourned) revival of “One Day at a Time.” Kellett, who plays a minor character here, offers a rich premise: a multigenerational, LGBTQ-inclusive, multiethnic Latinx family gathering together on various holidays over the course of nearly a year, starting with Nochebuena, or Christmas Eve. It’s not only a feel-good show that actually feels good, but it’s also a welcome reminder, at the end of another exhausting 12 months, that there are possibilities and celebrations to come in the new year.
Set in Portland, Ore. — Kellett’s hometown — “With Love” is a romantic comedy rooted in culturally specific traditions and family dynamics. At its center are 20-something siblings Lily (Emeraude Toubia), a hopeless romantic who’s freshly single, and Jorge (Mark Indelicato, “Ugly Betty”), a high-strung relationship-newbie who may have found the perfect man in Henry (Vincent Rodriguez III, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”).
The series opens in church, where Lily helps Jorge pull off a ruse that lets their grandmother (Renée Victor) believe that her grandson was there too, even if she didn’t see him during the service. The Diazes are a clan in which being out is okay, but skipping Mass is not.
With each episode named after a holiday, “Nochebuena” builds toward the family party, where Lily has to endure nosy questions about her romantic status, despite the open contentment of their 40-something “spinster” aunt (Kellett), and Jorge plans to introduce Henry to his parents and grandparents for the first time.
These are far from original scenarios, but they’re presented with such verve, wit and warmth that all those other times you’ve seen these situations play out fade away. It’s all too easy to get invested in these characters’ plights: the brave face that Lily puts on despite her heartbreak, until holding up the mask becomes too strenuous; Jorge’s fears that his father’s distance indicates a disapproval of Henry, whose bisexuality becomes a talking point at the party.
Lily and Jorge get their idealism about love and romance not (just) from Julia Roberts movies, but from their admiration of their parents, whose marriage is secretly crumbling behind doors. While the siblings’ travails stay light as air, there’s a groundedness to the parents’ predicament. After working alongside his wife, Beatriz (Constance Marie), for years at their Mexican restaurant, Jorge Sr. (Benito Martinez) no longer shows an interest in her. A woman who’s spent her life helping other people pursue their dreams at the expense of her own, Beatriz considers looking elsewhere for the affection and validation she craves in a plotline that, like Lily and Jorge’s, is made fresh by the performances and cultural details.
Somewhere between those tonal polarities is Lily and Jorge’s trans, nonbinary cousin Sol’s (Isis King) flirtations with a fellow doctor (“One Day at a Time” alum Todd Grinnell) at their hospital. In an ensemble stuffed with charismatic veteran actors, many of them playing refreshingly against type, King isn’t the most naturalistic performer. But Sol’s narrative is the most compelling, taking unpredictable turns into the generational differences among queer communities and, in a particularly moving subplot, their wistful relationship with their deceased parents on the Day of the Dead.
One of the hardest things a TV show can pull off is to make a viewer laugh out loud when they’re watching something alone. I lost track of how many times I guffawed during the first two episodes, which also made me tear up quite a bit. The ultra-sincere spirit of “One Day at a Time” feels alive and well in “With Love,” which isn’t quite as polished as that earlier show, but recalls it in its skillful and occasionally surprising swerves between humor and poignancy (as well as in its slight preachiness).
With just two series, Kellett has greatly increased Latinx representation on television. But her shows aren’t about pandering to audiences that have waited too long to see themselves on screen; they are about honoring the past while grappling with how identities expand and adapt — and must do so to remain relevant to new generations.
The latter half of the season doesn’t quite measure up to the show’s robust kickoff, especially as focus grows on Santiago (Rome Flynn), a Darcy-esque misanthrope whose terminally ill mother is a patient of Sol’s, and his father (the always great Andre Royo). A handful of well-cast supporting players — chief among them Julissa Calderon, playing Santiago’s straight-talking friend, and Desmond Chiam, practically a grin with abs as Lily’s muscular shoulder to cry on — help keep the proceedings nimble and energetic. And although I did feel the lack of a story line involving the grandparents, by the end of the season, there was only one thing I really wanted for Christmas: another year with the Diazes."
