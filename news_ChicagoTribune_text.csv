Hispanic Heritage Month to be celebrated in Lake County despite pandemic
By Yadira Sanchez Olson

The pandemic won’t allow large social gatherings like previous annual celebrations for Hispanic Heritage Month, with parades filled with people standing shoulder-to-shoulder for hours in the streets, ethnic food, games and colorful decorations.
But the observance that recognizes and celebrates contributions of people who can trace their roots to Spain, Mexico, Central America and the South American and Spanish-speaking nations of the Caribbean, will go on with a number of virtual activities aimed to educate and entertain, organized by local libraries and the College of Lake County.
Always running from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, the observance is the celebration that begins in the middle rather than the start of September because it coincides with national independence days in several Latin American countries: Guatemala, Honduras, El_Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa_Rica celebrate theirs on Sept. 15; followed by Mexico on Sept. 16; Chile on Sept. 18, and Belize on Sept 21, according to the Pew Research Center.
“Hispanic Heritage Month reminds us of our strength as Latinos,” said Maria Elena Jonas, founder and executive director of the Hispanic American Community Education and Services.
The Waukegan-based organization, better known as HACES, has for decades provided the county’s Hispanic community programming that promotes civic engagement, and links families to county resources and advocacy.
Like other county organizations that empower community members who come from immigrant families, HACES has been focusing efforts on two of the most pressing issues impacting those living in the U.S. — The 2020 Census and the November presidential election.
“No matter the circumstances, there is space in our hearts to not lose hope for a better tomorrow,” Jonas said. “Our collective strength and action will make our hopes a reality as we get ourselves counted in the Census, and as we cast our vote in this important election.”
According to the Pew Research Center, a record 32 million Latinos are projected to be eligible to vote in this year’s election, which is up from 27.3 million in 2016.
The nonpartisan think-tank based in Washington states that 2020 will be an unprecedented time for Hispanics living in the U.S., as it will mark the first time the group will be the largest racial and ethnic minority in the electorate, accounting for just over 13 percent of eligible voters.
“This month-long celebration acknowledges the contribution of Latinx in Lake County, a growing population with lasting effects on the culture and economy of our community. It’s very important for Latinx to participate in this year’s election, and our events help bring awareness to these important topics and others like it. Students from local community colleges are getting together to create change. These collaborative events are open to the public and available online. Everyone is welcome,” said Rodolfo Ruiz-Velasco, multicultural access and success coordinator at the Multicultural Student Center.
One of the virtual educational events scheduled in September by the College of Lake County that touches on political participation is: “iYa es el Tiempo! Students Coming Together to Create Change.”
According to the college’s website, the virtual event will be about the basics of civil discourse and power to help prepare for and navigate the challenges of achieving social, political, and institutional change — 34.6 percent of CLC’s student body identifies as Latinx, according to college officials.
“The College of Lake County is committed to all students' success, and we’re working hard to close the achievement gap for our Latinx students,” Ruiz-Velasco said.
Other Zoom discussions offered by CLC this month include a talk on what the term Latinx is, who is using it, and how the COVOD-19 pandemic has affected the Latinx community.
The college’s Latinx virtual events are sponsored by the Multicultural Student Center, Fearless Dreamers Alliance, Latino Alliance, Diversity Council and Latinx Outreach and Success Committee.
“Latinx Heritage Month gives a voice to part of our community that doesn’t normally see themselves in higher education,” said Dean of Student Life Gabriel Lara."

Justina Machado’s taking it one day — and one step — at a time on ‘Dancing with the Stars’
By Nina Metz

One of the reasons Justina Machado agreed to do “Dancing with the Stars” this season is because it gave her the opportunity to talk about her show “One Day at a Time,” the fourth season of which is currently airing on CBS.
A reboot of the Norman Lear original, it’s been one of the most consistently funny comedies on TV — and one of the only to feature a Latinx family at its center. The show began at Netflix, which wasn’t able (or perhaps willing) to give the show the kind of high-profile promotion it needed. When Netflix pulled the plug, Pop TV stepped in and greenlit a fourth season — shot this past spring — which was truncated because of the pandemic.
Which leaves the show’s fate up in the air. How well it does during this run on CBS will determine if it has a future.
The stories unfold in a cheerily modest apartment in LA. Machado plays a divorced mother of two who also lives with her own mother, played with hilarious verve by Rita Moreno. “Hold on tight/we’ll muddle through/one day at a time,” the infectious theme song promises. Talk about encapsulating a moment.
Machado is a Chicago native and we spoke recently about “Dancing with the Stars,” her hopes for “One Day at a Time” and the dearth of Latinx representation on TV.
Q: Why do you think it’s been challenging to build a groundswell of awareness around “One Day at a Time”?
A: We haven’t had enough marketing and that’s a huge deal. But also I think that people get so caught up in thinking that it’s a Latino show that they can’t relate to. Which, to me, always blows my mind.
I’m born and raised in Chicago to Puerto_Rican parents — I’m first generation — and I grew up watching quote-unquote “white” shows and I always found something to relate to. So we’re trying to change that narrative of what you think our shows are about. What you think we’re about.I have people coming on my Instagram, now that I’m doing “Dancing with the Stars,"" and saying, “Oh my gosh, I didn’t even know who you were and I didn’t even know what this show was, but now I’m going to watch.” I have people on “Dancing with the Stars” who are like, “What’s that show?”
Q: Does that bug you, though?
A: (Laughs) No, it doesn’t bug me. It just shows you how many things there are on TV now and we need more marketing for these types of shows. The critics have been nothing but amazing to us, but how do we get people to watch?
Q: What I find so confusing is that you can have a show like “Cobra Kai,” which originated on YouTube, come to Netflix and become this big hit — and without a whole lot of old school promotion behind it — but Netflix struggles to do the same with its own originals. I don’t understand it.
A: Me neither. But I think the difference with “Cobra Kai” is the nostalgia. I gotta tell you, I watched both seasons because I loved “Karate Kid,” I’m an 80s kid. So I think it’s the nostalgia, they don’t have to do a lot of marketing for that.
But I will say this: I am super grateful to Netflix because I know that no other network would have put “One Day at the Time” on the air because they would have been afraid of the subjects we tackle. (The show addresses everything from PTSD to racism to sexual identity to addiction.) So Netflix was courageous and I’m grateful for those three seasons.
Q: Did you decide to do “Dancing with the Stars” this season because it would give you this huge platform to let people know about the CBS run of “One Day at a Time?”
A: Absolutely. There were many reasons. One, my mother is a fanatic of the show and has always wanted me to be on it, which is hilarious. The second reason was COVID; like a lot of people I was feeling a rollercoaster of emotions — just depression and kind of tired of being in that state — and I thought, what a great thing to be dancing.
And No. 3, yes, it was to bring attention to the show. That was absolutely one of the factors.
Q: I think people are curious: What are the logistics of doing “Dancing with the Stars” during a pandemic?
A: OK so, every single day we’re tested. Every day. When we go to the studio to rehearse, we’re masked. They take our temperature. And then we go into our rehearsal room, and we only leave to use the bathroom or get some water — and we’re always masked. We don’t interact with other dancers, we don’t interact with other celebrities, we just go straight into our room.
Then when we are on the show, each couple has their own hair and makeup (people), so we’re in the same bubble. So Sasha and I have the same hair and makeup and they don’t do anyone else.
Then we have COVID officers on set — believe me, we have many COVID officers who are constantly separating us, because human nature, you want to go talk to another person. But unless it’s your partner, they’re separating us and making sure we’re six-to-eight feet apart, even though we’re being tested every day. So they’re being extremely rigorous.
Q: I don’t know if ABC is even allowed to do this, but do they try to suggest what you do in your off time? You always wonder, what if someone goes to a family gathering or a party?
A: They can’t do that. But I know they separated the dancers that are married; there are three couples on the show that are married and they have to live in separate apartments. They can’t go home to each other during the duration of the show.
But everybody is doing everything so that the show doesn’t go down. I mean, I don’t do anything because I’m so nervous about going out. I’m like, “Hmm, I don’t know about that.”
In June, three months after the pandemic hit, my brother and I drove 30 hours to Chicago, and we did it non-stop. We didn’t fly, we drove, just so we could be with our family because we were losing our minds. We stayed for a month and then came back to LA because my brother had to get back to work and I had stuff to do. But we probably would have stayed longer because we just felt safe with my brothers and my sister and my mom. We were in Logan Square and all just kept within our little bubble. Actually, it’s Avondale. There’s new names for places in Chicago! Back in the day we would just say the streets. I grew up all over: Lincoln Park, Humboldt Park and Avondale and Logan Square.
I actually hadn’t been home for that amount of time since my 20s. It’s always interesting to rediscover Chicago. I left in 1994 or 1995 and it’s always interesting to see the changes. What I miss are the neighborhoods. I don’t see neighborhoods too much anymore, it’s kind of all the same. Now I’m walking down the street and seeing townhouses being built and it looks generic. So there were certain things, when I walked around the city, that surprised me.
Q: A study came out earlier this month that found there’s an increase in diversity on TV over the last three years, with the exception of Latinx people, who remain underrepresented. Why do you think that is?
A: I think when a show is greenlit, they don’t allow that show to grow an audience. They cancel the show after maybe a few episodes.
This doesn’t just happen with Latinx shows, it happens with a lot of shows — but we’re talking about Latinx because we’re the ones who don’t have many shows on the air. So that’s one of the problems.
Also, you have to have authenticity and specificity. If you just make a generic story, people aren’t going to relate to that? That’s why people loved the movie “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” — they hear the Windex joke and they’re like, “Oh, we have something like that in my culture!” Latinx people are like that with Vicks VapoRub, we think it cures everything. So those little specific details and that authenticity is what makes people go, “Oh, there’s something like that in my family.” And having Latinx people in the writers room when you’re telling a Latinx story is of the utmost importance. So more of those writers need to be hired.
But at the end of the day, we need marketing. Because if you don’t know about it, you’re not going to watch it.
Q: What is the future of “One Day at a Time”?
A: Pop TV is not doing scripted television anymore. So either we get another season on CBS or we go away. So that’s why it’s so important for people to watch these episodes on Mondays because that will determine whether we get a fifth season on CBS.
The stakes are high.
But the stakes are high in everything right now. We’re all used to it because we’re all living in a state of anxiety. Vote, vote, vote. Make sure you vote."

Real estate predictions for 2021: Eviction crisis on the horizon while suburban shift and ‘Zoom rooms’ trend for homebuyers
By Darcel Rockett

The year that is 2020 can’t be in our collective rearview mirror soon enough.
Despite the pandemic’s tumultuous curveballs, there was still some happy news in the world of Chicago-area real estate: This new decade brought with it new technology to help renters with landlord issues; it brought us a glimpse of the architecture world and the female creatives within; and it allowed us to see that the more things change, the more traditional elements of what people want in a home persist.
This year also revealed just how prevalent disinvestment and discrimination remain in the housing sector, although there’s hope in how many people — from celebrated Chicago artist Theaster Gates to a West Woodlawn native looking to give back — are doing their part to turn that around in Chicago’s marginalized neighborhoods. And even amid a year where the virus took center stage, art and community remained ways to keep people connected.
What will 2021 bring? Most urgently, experts say the new year can’t be discussed without a focus on evictions. Others predict the continuation of other pandemic-related trends, like the shift toward roomier suburban living and increased demand for spaces for wellness, outdoor areas and short-term leases.
1. A tidal wave of evictions could be on its way
The state ban on most pandemic-related evictions is currently set to expire Jan. 9, although it has been extended each month throughout most of 2020. If enacted, the federal relief package as it currently stands would extend the national moratorium through January and allot $25 billion to federal rental assistance, but it’s unclear how much longer both measures will last into the new year.
If the state moratorium ends next month, the Lawyers’ Committee for Better Housing predicts up to 21,000 backlogged evictions could be filed in Chicago by the end of January. In comparison, an average of 1,567 evictions were filed each month in January and February 2020, before the statewide shutdown.
Other studies resulted in similarly dire predictions: Nonpartisan think tank Aspen Institute estimated in August that at least 31% and up to half of Illinois households are at risk of eviction, representing up to 1.7 million people in 762,000 households. A more conservative estimate from Stout, a global advisory firm, would still see up to 532,000 renter households at risk.
In a December report, LCBH and the Center for Urban Research and Learning at Loyola University Chicago examined how unemployment rates correlate with eviction trends to estimate how many pandemic-related evictions might be filed when moratoria are lifted.
Among their findings, researchers saw that when unemployment jumps by 1%, statistically an additional 82 evictions would be filed in Chicago the following month. After this year’s high levels of unemployment and delayed eviction filings that could still be carried out after the moratoria end, more evictions could be filed in a single month than in all of 2019, the report predicted.
LCBH analyzed intel from its Chicago Evictions Data Portal and found that majority-Black areas had eviction filing rates five times higher than majority-white areas. Evictions in Latinx neighborhoods were twice as high.
Black and Latinx households are more likely to be renting than white ones, and more than half of Black and Latinx households are cost burdened, meaning they pay more than 30% of their income on housing, compared to only 40% of white households.
“We are concerned that the spike in eviction filings will be more heavily felt by Chicago’s Black and Latinx families,” said LCBH Executive Director Mark Swartz.
And the financial straits can have a dramatic impact; tenants in Chicago are often evicted despite owing relatively small amounts of money, according to an LCBH analysis. Of Chicago eviction cases filed from 2010 through 2017, 82% included claims for owed back rent. One in five of those renters owed less than $1,000, and 44% owed under $2,500.
2. Advocates call for more housing assistance
Numerous rental assistance programs were launched this year to prevent further housing instability in the state, including grants funded through the first federal relief act passed earlier this year and ongoing efforts to aid those who are already homeless.
LCBH is calling on state legislators to enact protections for tenants who have made partial payments during the pandemic. With its research showing renters with evictions on their record can have difficulty finding housing, LCBH is also recommending eviction files be sealed from the public.
“Renters who have lost their jobs shouldn’t have to fear losing their homes in the middle of this pandemic,” Swartz said. “A federal moratorium coupled with rental assistance that helps both renters and landlords is the best response at this time.”
A coalition of housing experts is calling for the passage of a Cook County Residential Tenant Landlord Ordinance, which would mirror similar laws in Chicago, Evanston and Mount Prospect. Most recently on Dec. 16, the Cook County Board of Commissioners advanced the bill through its zoning committee.
3. Suburban shift could grow
With over two decades of real estate experience in the Chicago area, Lindsay Weinstein of Coldwell Banker Realty has seen the market through the Great Recession, rises and declines in population and the severe shortage of housing stock in recent years.
With such low inventory, exacerbated by the pandemic, Weinstein said she could see prices continuing to rise, and the suburbs becoming an increasingly popular destination. As people seek homes with more space and less proximity to others following a cramped, cooped-up year, continued flight from city to suburbs would hardly be surprising, she said.
As more people continue to work remotely, location will be less of a limitation, freeing up job seekers to focus on priorities other than a short commute, according to Apartment Guide. But with rent prices dropping in some urban areas, big cities like Chicago could draw people back with more affordable living costs as demand drops.
4. More demand for short-term rentals
With the pandemic came uncertainty in spades, including in what our housing needs might be months down the road.
From July through November, Americans increasingly searched for leases of six months or less, according to apartment listing platform ApartmentList.com.
Per that data, this is true both of renters who are looking to move someplace new, as well as those who are searching close to where they already live.“Lease conditions that were once set in stone, such as the traditional 12-month lease, are now negotiable, giving renters more leeway to customize terms to better accommodate their needs,” said Ben Creamer, founder and managing broker of Downtown Apartment Company, a full-service brokerage specializing in luxury apartments in Chicago.
5. Changes to physical spaces based on pandemic needs
Per Zillow, the real estate website and research center, people sought more space in their home for health and wellness activities.
Listings that mentioned “health and wellness” increased starting in the summer months, peaking in November as lockdown orders resumed and the shifting seasons took away precious daylight hours for outdoor activities.
The need for additional private spaces in homes with room for reflection and meditation is increasing, and home offices became a top priority, with some specifically searching for “Zoom rooms” for easier remote work video conferences, Zillow found.
Add to that a demand for more devices to make homes stay as germ-free as possible — like touchless appliances and self-cleaning toilets and bidets. What is now considered niche will grow to be more standard as homeowners can start welcoming guests back inside, Zillow reported.
A request for more outdoor space, regardless of single-family home or multifamily building dwelling, is also on trend. Look for an even stronger emphasis moving forward on building designs, floor plans and amenities that help bring in the outdoors.
Good or bad, the new year is just days away, and the only thing that can be counted on is that it will certainly bring change."

Embattled Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan gets backing for reelection from majority of Latinx Caucus
By Rick Pearson

As Illinois House lawmakers prepare to reconvene next Friday with uncertainty surrounding their future Democratic leadership, a majority of the chamber’s Latinx Caucus said they were backing embattled Michael Madigan for another term as speaker.
In a statement from the caucus Friday, state Reps. Elizabeth “Lisa” Hernandez and Fred Crespo said that because of the state’s troubled finances, the need for recovery from COVID-19 and a desire for increased representation in the approaching redrawing of legislative districts, “the majority of Latinx members determined that Speaker Madigan is in the best position to move these priorities forward in the coming term.”
“In these unprecedented times, we are being called to address matters of life and death in our community, and must act swiftly with full support from leadership, to alleviate this unmitigated pain and suffering, through emergency housing legislation, expansion of health care coverage and protection of community supports,” the group’s statement said.
“We will continue to hold Speaker Madigan and other state leaders accountable for responding to the needs of the Latinx community,” it said.
Both Hernandez of Cicero and Crespo of Hoffman Estates are members of Madigan’s current leadership team.
House Democrats list 14 lawmakers in the Latinx Caucus. But four of them are among 19 House Democrats who have publicly stated they will not support Madigan for another term as speaker when the next General Assembly is inaugurated on Jan. 13.
With 73 House Democrats expected to be seated in the new legislature, the 19 dissidents leave Madigan six votes shy of the 60 members needed to be elected speaker for another term.
Madigan, a Southwest Side Democrat, is the nation’s longest-serving House speaker. He has held the post since 1983 with the exception of two years in the mid-1990s when Republicans gained control.
But Madigan’s leadership, long the subject of attacks from the Republican minority, has been shaken in a federal bribery investigation of Commonwealth Edison. The utility has agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with investigators for its involvement in a scheme to influence Madigan by offering bribes, jobs and contracts to his top allies.
Last month, Madigan’s top political confidant, former legislator and lobbyist Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to participating in the effort along with former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, lobbyist and former ComEd executive John Hooker and Jay Doherty, a consultant and former head of the City Club of Chicago.
Madigan has said he had no knowledge of the effort and has not committed any wrongdoing. The 78-year-old lawmaker has not been charged.
Only one Democrat has publicly announced a challenge to Madigan for speaker, state Rep. Stephanie Kifowit of Oswego, but she has not identified any public support.
The Latinx Caucus statement followed a forum on Dec. 23 with Madigan and Kifowit, with no additional contenders surfacing. Earlier last month, after a similar forum, the House Democratic Black Caucus issued a statement backing Madigan’s reelection as speaker. Of the 22-member caucus, only one, state Rep. Maurice West of Rockford, has said he will not back Madigan for another term."

‘In the Heights’ debuts energy-filled trailer celebrating Latinx culture
By Natalie Oganesyan

The wait is finally over for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s adaptation of his Tony-nominated musical “In the Heights,” directed by Jon M. Chu. With a new trailer debut Sunday, the first official look at the completed pic since late 2019, the drama is set to deliver on its promise of celebrating Latinx culture in New York City when it hits theaters and HBO Max June 18.
Prior to the trailer’s debut, the film’s Twitter account unveiled new posters and art, which featured pops of blue, purple, red and orange with various backgrounds framing the cursive stylization of “In the Heights.”
The musical drama stars “Hamilton” alum Anthony Ramos as Usnavi, a bodega owner with big dreams living in the predominantly Dominican Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The slice-of-life musical unfolds over the course of three days, featuring cast members Corey Hawkins, Jimmy Smits, Melissa Barrera, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Dascha Polanco and Stephanie Beatriz. Miranda, who originated the role of Usnavi on stage, will instead portray Piraguero, the owner of a small piragua stand.
The Warner Bros. adaptation of Miranda’s Broadway play, which was penned by Quiara Alegria Hudes, was originally scheduled to debut last June, but was postponed as the pandemic began to sweep the country, shuttering theaters and halting film productions.
Chu, who previously helmed “Crazy Rich Asians” describes the film as a universal story that cherishes family and the immigrant community. “You can’t change the world if they don’t want to change, but never underestimate the power of planting a seed,” Chu said. “I believe that this movie is an amazingly beautiful seed that can change a lot of minds.”"

Latinx speakers urge Waukegan school board not to rename middle school for Barack and Michelle Obama
By Steve Sadin

Shortly before members of the Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 Board of Education learned the voting procedure to change the names of two middle schools, they heard impassioned pleas not to name one of them after former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.
The board took no vote on renaming Thomas Jefferson or Daniel Webster Middle School during its first in-person meeting in more than a year Tuesday at the Brookside campus of Waukegan High School because procedures first needed to be put in place.
Board President Brandon Ewing said after the meeting the vote will take place at the next scheduled meeting at 7 p.m. on April 13, most likely at the Brookside campus.
While board members will vote from a choice of three names for Jefferson and another trio for Webster, they received a clear message from six members of the Latinx community Jefferson should not become Barack & Michelle Obama Middle School.
Oscar Arias, a Waukegan native and former district student, said during the public comment portion of the meeting the Obama name should be rejected because more than 3 million people were deported during the former president’s administration.
“That’s many families that were affected and separated, many of whom reside right here in Waukegan,” Arias said. “The fear that many of my friends faced of never seeing their parents again after coming home from school still resonates with me.”
He suggested the board select another of the three nominated names, the John L. Lewis Middle School, to honor the late U.S. Congressman and civil rights activist.
“Lewis truly embodies the progressive and multicultural spirit of Waukegan,” Arias said.
Wygenia Brisco, who also spoke at the meeting, said as an African American she supports naming the school for Lewis because “of what he stood for.”
Another member of the public said he wanted to see local names. Board member Anita Hanna also mentioned a preference for naming the schools for people from Waukegan who made a mark on the community. One of the names for Webster, Edith Smith, is local.
Board members will consider the names of the Obamas, Lewis and both Dolores Huerta & Cesar Chavez together for Jefferson.
Choices for Webster are Ellen Ochoa Middle School, Katherine Johnson Middle School or Edith Smith Middle School. Ochoa and Johnson distinguished themselves in the United States space program, and Smith was a civil rights activist from Waukegan.
After a group of more than 80 Jefferson students and community members petitioned the board in June to change the name there because Jefferson was a slave owner, Ewing pushed his colleagues to switch the names of both Jefferson and Webster middle schools.
When Ewing discussed the issue with the board in November, he suggested changing the name of Webster as well because, “he was a defender of slavery.” Webster was a U.S. senator and secretary of state in the early to mid-1800s.
Ewing said during Tuesday’s meeting that board members will vote until one of the proposed names receives four of the seven votes. More than 400 names were suggested, and narrowed to six choices for each school. The three nominees were decided by a vote of the students, parents, teachers and administrators at each school.
Should no name receive four or more votes, Ewing said the board can combine two of the names as a compromise, or reject all of the names which means the existing ones remain.
Taking place in the 1,900-seat Orlin Trapp Auditorium, every other row was blocked off to prevent anyone from sitting there. Though attendance was limited to 50 people other than school personnel, 36 members of the public were present alleviating any social distancing issues. All wore masks as required, and went through a screening procedure before entering.
Board members and four administrators were seated on the stage at tables more than six feet apart. All wore masks. Other administrators were scattered around the auditorium.
Ewing said before the meeting a decision was made to meet in-person to show solidarity with students, families, teachers, administrators and staff who began returning to their buildings Monday. Meetings have been virtual for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Teachers, administrators and staff returned Monday to adjust to the new procedures and classroom layout, as well as professional development. The youngest students come back next Monday to begin the hybrid program, with more students following in the coming weeks.
Superintendent Theresa Plascencia said she has been to a number of schools already, and plans to tour them all by the end of Thursday. She observed some teachers who had not seen each other in more than a year.
“People miss people,” she said. “I saw their excitement at seeing each other again. They were starting to do everything necessary for student success.”"

Waukegan schools recruiting teachers from Puerto_Rico and internationally to provide Latinx students ‘enriched educational experience’
By Steve Sadin

Between a nationwide teacher shortage and challenges building a diverse teaching staff, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 started casting a wider net, including hiring 31 in the last three years from Puerto_Rico.
The District 60 Board of Education got a briefing on current efforts to keep its corps of approximately 1,100 teachers staffed during a meeting of its Operational Services Committee last Tuesday at Waukegan High School’s Brookside campus.
Along with traditional methods of recruitment like job boards, referrals and digital platforms, Angel Figueroa, the districts associate superintendent for human resources and employee benefits, started recruiting teachers from Puerto_Rico and Spain in 2018, and the Philippines last year.
With a Latinx enrollment approaching 80%, Figueroa said finding teachers who share a first language with students is important. Teachers from Puerto_Rico in particular meet that need with no immigration issues, and a background enabling them to easily become licensed in Illinois.
“We believe our staff should mirror the diversity present in our nation as our district aspires to provide our students with an enriched educational experience that facilitates learning and acceptance from each other, and sets them on a journey of success,” Figueroa said at the meeting.
Coming to Waukegan from Puerto_Rico himself after serving in the military, Figueroa said he taught bilingual education for six years, was an assistant principal and then principal at North Elementary School before taking his current position. He has been in the district for 30 years.
If he cannot fill the teaching positions with licensed teachers, Figueroa said he must use substitute instructors which he considers an inferior solution. Recruiting from Puerto_Rico and internationally helps bring qualified, licensed full time teachers to Waukegan.
“If you have a school with 20 classrooms, that’s three schools,” he said. “We’re doing it with qualified, licensed teachers,” he added in an interview Thursday. “There is an instant rapport with our students.”
Along with hiring 31 teachers from Puerto_Rico in the last three years, Figueroa said the district hired 18 from Spain and 13 from the Philippines. The effort in the Philippines was all last year.
On his first recruiting mission to Puerto_Rico in 2018, Figueroa hired 18 teachers. Two of them were Rafael Ramon-Melendez, who teaches bilingual social science on the Washington campus of Waukegan High School, and wife, Vivian Torres, a Spanish language arts teacher.
A 21-year educator as a classroom teacher and six years as a principal, Ramon-Melendez was the island’s secretary of education from 2013 through 2017. Figueroa said the position is the equivalent of heading the Illinois State Board of Education.
Ramon-Melendez said after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto_Rico in 2017, a lot of teachers were out of work. Figueroa arrived that year seeking people to teach in Waukegan and interviewed Torres. When she got an offer, the decisions were easy.
“She said, ‘I’m going with you or without you,’” Ramon-Melendez said during an interview Thursday. “Mr. Figueroa called me, and asked me to come to Waukegan too. We’ve had a very good experience.”
During the interview process, Figueroa said with a laugh weather always comes up. He tells them about the change of seasons, and the ability to travel around the United States. He also has some serious advice.
“I tell them to get a good coat as soon as they land at O’Hare,” he said.
Ramon-Melendez, who also laughed when asked about Waukegan winters, said adjusting to subzero temperatures their first winter here took some doing.
“January of 2019 was just awful,” he said. “From there, it got better.”
Board member Jeff McBride asked at the meeting what was being done to hire more minorities among the teaching and professional staff. He suggested using a consultant. Superintendent Theresa Plascencia mentioned holding a workshop with board members to show them the statistics on the availability of minorities.
“When the board sees the national numbers, along with the state numbers, you’ll see the percentage of people of color that are actually choosing to go into education has declined,” she said.
Figueroa said during the meeting a diverse teaching staff will better prepare Waukegan graduates for the multilayered world they will enter when they seek careers and jobs. They will be prepared for variety in the workplace.
“That’s very important because we have a large minority population in our schools,” Figueroa said. “We need to prepare them to be successful in the job market anywhere they are in the nation. We want to expose them to every type of culture.”"

Break up the ‘Southside’ and other verdicts on words 
By Eric Zorn

Southside v. South Side
This matter came to the attention of the court earlier this month when the White Sox unveiled a new uniform variant featuring “Southside” in gothic letters across the chest.
“We wanted it to be real and authentic,” said Brooks Boyer, the team’s senior vice president and chief revenue and marketing officer, in an interview with the Tribune’s Lamond Pope. The all-black uniforms with white pinstripes signifies the “mentality of a work ethic, of a pride in getting after it and working the right way” that reflects both the team and the part of the city in which it plays its home games.
The court, located on the Northwest Side, is a convert to the White Sox and generally admires the new look but rules firmly against “Southside” as one word. The court sides with The Associated Press, the Tribune, the Sun-Times, the Daily Herald and South Side Weekly. Also with the South Side Sox fan website and nearly 3 out of 4 Tribune readers who responded to a multiple-choice poll on the question this week.
“Southside” looks like someone forgot to hit the space bar.
Innocent until proven guilty v. innocent unless proven guilty
The court respects precedent and tradition. The phrase “innocent until proven guilty” to describe the legal presumption of innocence that prosecutors must overcome to win a conviction at trial has appeared 125 times more often in local newspaper archives than the phrase “innocent unless proven guilty.” But the court rules for “... unless.”
“Until” suggests the legal system and the media are simply biding their time with fictions and formalities prior to the inevitable guilty verdict.“Unless” better reminds us of the uncertainty of the outcome and the possibility, sacred in our system, that the accused person might not be found guilty.
‘Guys’ as a gender-inclusive term
The court will allow it. Although the word carried a strong sense of male identity in the days of “Guys and Dolls” (1955), common usage of “guys” by men and women to refer to mixed groups or even all female groups has removed most of its former gender connotations.
“OK, guys, let’s go” addresses everyone equally in most contexts.
However, the court recommends “folks,” “folx,” “people,” “everybody” or “y’all” in situations where some of those present might not feel comfortable with this common usage. The court decrees that “guys” is a word not worth arguing over.
Gratuitous grandmas
By “grandmas,” the court means any seemingly benign descriptive terms deployed in news stories for the sole purpose of evoking stereotypes and issues a stern restraining order.
Noting that a woman is a grandmother when that fact is irrelevant to the subject at hand — something the court sees far too often — is to suggest without evidence a certain inherent sweetness and caring nature that a woman of the same age without grandchildren implicitly does not possess.The court refers readers to ranker.com’s roster of “17 Little Old Ladies Who Were Actually Unspeakably Brutal Murderers” and extends its ruling to grandfathers, cheerleaders, community volunteers, gardeners and all other categories that seem to hint at qualities.
Latinx
The court strongly recommends referring to individuals and the groups of people with the label or labels they prefer. That’s good manners and common decency.
But the court takes note of a December 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center about the emerging, gender-inclusive term that found “only 23% of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have heard of the term Latinx, and just 3% say they use it to describe themselves.”
The court also references the results of a similar OH Predictive Insights poll taken in March that found “only 1% of respondents prefer to be called Latinx ... The majority, 54%, prefer Hispanic, while 18% prefer Latino or Latina,” which are gendered terms, though Latino is traditionally considered all-encompassing.
In view of these results, the court issues a stay on the presumptive use of Latinx as the favored term but remains open to revisiting the issue as usage trends change. It also issues a supplemental advisory opinion for you to follow the language lead of those with whom you are having discourse.
Woke
The court is belatedly following the guidance of NPR correspondent and host Sam Sanders, who in 2018 offered a commentary titled “It’s Time To Put ‘Woke’ To Sleep.”
In its original meaning in Black vernacular, “woke” meant having a heightened and constant awareness of issues of racial justice.
“I been sleeping all my life,” says a character in Black playwright Barry Beckham’s 1971 work “Garvey Lives!” about Black activist Marcus Garvey. “And now that Mr. Garvey done woke me up, I’m gon’ stay woke. And I’m gon’ help him wake up other Black folk.”
The word gained currency with the rise of Black Lives Matter — “Stay Woke” was the title of a 2016 documentary on the movement and “became shorthand for a mindset and a worldview that values Black lives,” said Sanders, who is Black.
That mindset is good thing in the opinion of the court, and the word was made even better when its definition expanded to include consciousness of the struggles of other marginalized people.
But “woke” was fairly quickly hijacked by the right and became basically a slur — or at best a “linguistic eye-roll,” as Sanders put it — deployed to suggest earnest, performative liberal excess and hypersensitivity.
It’s a crisp sneer, one the court admits to using itself in moments of frustration and exasperation at the looniest pronouncements of the left. But hurling “woke” ends up trivializing the very real concerns in which the word originally had roots and abets the comprehensive effort to mock and minimize those concerns.
“Woke” is hereby sentenced to oblivion.
Court is adjourned!"

A new documentary suggests there’s a lot more to Rita Moreno than what she told Stephen Colbert this week, before apologizing for it
By Michael Phillips

Trailblazer or sellout? Which is it? The binary thinkers among us demand an easy, simple answer, even though little in Moreno’s 89 years has been either.
The Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award winner is the subject of an illuminating new documentary, detailing among other things the steady stream of racist, humiliating Hollywood employment she put up with on screen since the 1950s, while fending off drooling, entitled white power brokers off-screen. That was then. For many, it’s also now.
This week Moreno wandered out onto a cultural tightrope in defense of Lin-Manuel Miranda. On Tuesday’s “Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” she defended her friend, the creator of “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” also co-executive producer of the documentary “Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It,” against charges of colorism, cultural blindness and a lack of Afro-Latinx speaking roles in director Jon M. Chu’s “In the Heights” film adaptation.In a June 9 story and video on theroot.com, Felice León confronted the issue. Her story’s headline: “Let’s talk about ‘In the Heights’ and the erasure of dark-skinned Afro-Latinx folks.”
In the accompanying Zoom interview, director Chu notes the inclusion of dark-skinned Afro-Latinx performers in the dance sequences. Not enough, Leon responds. “A lead, you know? That’s the breakthrough. We want to see Black people in the Heights. We want to see Afro-Panamanians. Black Cubans. Black Dominicans. That’s what we want to see.”
On Twitter Monday, Miranda apologized, acknowledging that “many in our dark-skinned Afro-Latino community don’t feel sufficiently represented within (the movie), particularly among the leading roles.” He recognized that as a result, to many “the work feels extractive of the community we wanted to represent with pride and joy. In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short. I’m truly sorry.”
The next night, Moreno brought it up with Colbert. She praised her fellow Puerto_Rican, Miranda, for making the cultural inroads she could not. She pushed back against those calling out “In the Heights” for colorist casting practices (though some of it’s baked into the material), especially after a wobbly opening weekend at the box office.
“I’m simply saying, ‘Can’t you just wait a while and leave it alone?’” Moreno asked. Colbert, non-verbally, looked like conflicted liberal whiteness incarnate. Then he changed the subject.
And then Moreno became an insta-pariah on social media, leading to her own apology Wednesday.
“I’m incredibly disappointed with myself,” she tweeted. “While making a statement in defense of Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Colbert show last night, I was clearly dismissive of Black lives that matter in our Latin community. It is so easy to forget how celebration for some is lament for others. In addition to applauding Lin for his wonderful movie version of ‘In The Heights,’ let me add my appreciation for his sensitivity and resolve to be more inclusive of the Afro-Latino community going forward.”
For those who now see Moreno as a traitor or a living, breathing blindspot, thanks to this week’s media cycle, “Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It” may complicate that viewpoint even if it doesn’t change it.
Born in Puerto_Rico in 1931, as a preteen Moreno moved with her mother (she never again saw her brother) to New York City. She grew up there, she says in director Mariem Pérez Riera’s documentary, “learning and believing that I didn’t have much worth.”
She was dancing in Greenwich Village nightclubs by age 6, quit school at 15 and made her first picture by 19, a reform school melodrama called “So Young, So Bad.”
She played a lot of bit-part Latinas that screamed “spitfire.” Under contract with MGM, she nabbed a small role in “Singin’ in the Rain” in 1952 as Zelda, a notable and promising break from the native girls and fiery temptresses in grass skirts or headdresses. But MGM, followed by 20th Century Fox, didn’t have much interest in Moreno’s range. In the documentary, George Chakiris, Moreno’s fellow Oscar-winner from “West Side Story,” recalls her saying: “I got so tired of having to say ‘Why you like white girl?’ or ‘Why you take gold from my people?’”Off camera she had a long, torturous relationship with Marlon Brando and a quicker one with Elvis Presley, and her career endured every variety of typecasting, dry spells, comebacks. For those of us whose childhoods were made better by the PBS series “The Electric Company,” she was simply a gas, a triple threat and really funny. On the recently cancelled “One Day at a Time” reboot, she garnered a new generation of fans.
In the documentary, Eva Longoria speaks to what it meant to see Moreno’s Anita take charge of her scenes in “West Side Story.” That 1961 film, for millions of Latinos and millions more beyond, remains a landmark mixed blessing. The 1957 Broadway show was extremely bold for its time. Today, for many (including the 15-year-old in our house), it’s full of dated stereotypes and brownface for, among others, Natalie Wood. And Moreno.
Another Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptation, “Flower Drum Song,” came out that same year. Also problematic. The role of San Francisco hepcat Sammy Fong, played by Jack Soo in the movie, was played by Larry Blyden on Broadway. Who replaced Larry Storch in tryouts. Another 1961 title, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” features Mickey Rooney in appalling yellowface casting. There are thousands upon thousands of similar examples throughout cinema history.
When “M. Butterfly” playwright David Henry Hwang rewrote “Flower Drum Song” for an L.A. (and, briefly, Broadway) stage revival in 2001, he told me that the ’61 movie version “always loomed large in my life. As a boomer Asian American, you didn’t often see people that looked like you on TV …. Growing up, the musical represented one of the few positive portrayals of people that looked like me.”
And then, he acknowledged, “at another point in my life, it became something to be demonized.” Hwang told me he was struggling to “accept it as an artifact of its time, to appreciate what was useful and important about it, and what was creaky and stereotypical about it.” With so much commercial entertainment, that struggle is the essence of cultural criticism.
This nation reveals itself to itself anew, with each generation’s stories. Who gets to tell them, and how often, lies at the heart of inequities we’re only recently addressing.
“In the Heights” opened with a tremendous burden of representation on its shoulders. I think there’s genuine sincerity and soul-searching in what Miranda has said about the limitations of his story’s lens.
Miranda has his flaws. He is also a tremendous talent. So is Moreno. That doesn’t change, even if she was thoughtlessly quick to dismiss those in and outside the Afro-Latinx community and their frustration with “In the Heights.” The neighborhood, the real one and the pretend, deserved truer colors and a fuller spectrum.
Any film promising to represent even a fraction of an under-represented population can’t win, in the end. The problem is weirdly simple: There aren’t enough of those films getting made. There are too many wasted hours designed to find ways for a studio to make something more palatable or an easier sell. You know. Whiter.
While many found Moreno’s contrition insincere, I think everything she lived en route to this week — every obstacle, every personal demon, every reminder of her boundless talent — earned her some grace. See what you think of “Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It.” Her story is also the story of how Hollywood worked, and the work it doled out to so many who deserved better. The best we can do now is widen America’s lens — a movie, a generation, an apology at a time."

DePaul Art Museum reckons with dearth of Latinx artists in U.S. collections
By Lori Waxman

Before viewing LatinXAmerican, a vigorous and timely exhibition of 40-plus artists of Latinx heritage that fills the entire DePaul Art Museum, you must first pass a 12-foot-tall green plumed headdress. Installed in the museum’s front windows, the transparent image depicts a 500-year-old relic, many times enlarged, that is said to have belonged to the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II, who gifted it to a Spanish conquistador. It currently belongs to the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, Austria, where it is the subject of repatriation claims by the Mexican government. Meanwhile a replica sits in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
To create this towering picture — through which, depending on the light and your position, can be glimpsed the El train, Fullerton Avenue and the museum interior — artist Claudia Peña Salinas blended photographs of the original and its copy. Neatly encapsulating ideas of authority, patrimony, authenticity and hybridity, “Quetzalli,” named for the bird that provided its 500 feathers, is the perfect entryway to LatinXAmerican.
And yet, “Quetzalli” is technically a stand-alone project and not part of the exhibition proper. But then LatinXAmerican is not a classic show of its kind, focused on the identity of a marginalized group as understood through its art. It does not provide thematic groupings of artworks nor biographical information on the included artists. It in no way essentializes what it means to be a person of Latinx descent who lives in the United States.
Instead the exhibition, which is part of DPAM’s multi-year Latinx Initiative, is concerned with examining and ultimately righting structural wrongs, the kind perpetrated by major American museums, whose collections, according to a 2018 survey, contain just 2.8% of work by artists of Latinx heritage, despite the fact that Latinx people make up 18.5% of the U.S. population. LatinXAmerican is basically a collections show, drawn from the holdings of DPAM, but one that takes a critical look at what isn’t there as much as what is, temporarily plugging those holes with works made by some of the most exciting artists of today, many of them Chicagoans.
What’s here, then, is what you get with any truly robust group show: good to great art, by makers familiar and not, in a surprising variety of media and styles, hung in ways that stimulate connection-making without being burdensome.
The main gallery opens with Ester Hernandez’s print of a skeleton girl in a huipil and ICE cuff, a biting riff on the Sun-Maid raisins box. Maybe the “Sun Raid” girl gets you thinking about portraiture, about how value is ascribed through the figures of generals, martyrs, society ladies and, yes, even fictional farm maidens. Want to think about grocery stores and their shelves full of political, social and cultural consequence? Look left, to Alberto Aguilar’s trio of hand-lettered signs, the kind typically found in the windows of Mexican food shops, but here featuring words that playfully challenge assumptions about cultural difference rather than advertise the price of chicken parts.Look right, to José Lerma’s suite of four portrait paintings, copies of canvases that hang in the Art Institute of Chicago, rendered in the standard construction materials of silicone applied to burlap stretched over standard doors. Those portraits hang atop a wallpaper sketched by Lerma as a teeming mass of hundreds of unidentifiable people. Maybe now consider the invisibility of immigrant labor and its tortured relationship to land politics? Look back to the left, where hangs a cotton tapestry, striated brown from being rubbed against the rusty corrugated metal border fence that has run along the San Diego-Tijuana border since 1994, in the area where Tanya Aguiñiga grew up. That’s a kind of wallpaper, too.
The front gallery offers a sequence of artists whose work depends on the potent relationship of words to color, sound, shape and form. Caroline Kent pairs brief typewritten texts — startling descriptions of a man drinking coffee, a woman who turned into a snake — with blotches of pastel and black paint, creating combinations whose poignancy belies their randomness. In an ongoing series, Dianna Frid embroiders phrases into paper so densely covered with graphite it appears to be a molten metal out of which the letters arise. On view is a volatile set, based on the newspaper obituaries of two men, one an anti-Castro dissident, the other a close ally of the Cuban leader; interpretation of the chosen quotes and even the color of their thread will depend on your personal politics.Upstairs is a chapel-like room, centered around Salvador Jiménez-Flores’s fantastical totem pole, an 8-foot-tall ceramic cactus sprouting spikes, masked luchadors, bricks and shimmering sunglasses, topped by the eagle and serpent of the Mexican flag. Arrayed around it are saints of all sorts: Sam Kirk’s radiant stained-glass portrait of a blue-haloed woman with skin in every shade of brown; Vincent Valdez’s Native American boxer, badly beat up, pierced by arrows, but, like Saint Sebastian, still standing; and Rodrigo Lara’s diminutive memorials of plastic grass, little marble tiles, and porcelain figures expertly modeled but pierced by hollows and gashes that reveal process and pain.
The exhibit goes on, upstairs and down, with Alejandro Jiménez-Flores’s impossibly delicate plaster reliefs, encasing flower petals and dirt, and Edra Soto’s elegant MDF screen, based on Puerto_Rican porch architecture and displaying green liquor bottles, scrubbed clean after being found on her daily neighborhood walks. There’s a photograph of Maria Gaspar lying on the ground in the Marin Headlands of Northern California, nearly undetectable in her custom suit of dry grasses, and Nicole Marroquin’s posters commemorating events, activists and institutions central to the history of Chicago’s Latinx community.
More than half of the artworks in LatinXAmerican are part of the museum’s collection, with about a dozen having been acquired in the past two years alone. The rest are on loan from the artists, but with any luck, and a lot of institutional (and donor) commitment, the next time they are on display, their labels will say, “Collection of DePaul Art Museum.”"

State’s attorney town hall focuses on Latinx community reluctance to report crimes; ‘Without that report ... justice won’t start’
By Lake County News-Sun

Seeking justice for crime victims is a prosecutor’s mission, but the job becomes harder when victims or witnesses are reluctant to come forward, Lake County’s state’s attorney told a group at a Hispanic Heritage Month event Monday in Waukegan.
Eric Rinehart gave attendees an overview of how the justice system process operates, but he acknowledged that hesitancy in the Latinx community to get involved, a fear often fueled as a result of immigration status, can short-circuit the process before it starts.
“If it doesn’t get reported, it doesn’t start the process,” one attendee said. “Reporting it is the roadblock because people are afraid to call the police to begin with.”
Rinehart agreed. “It’s a sad truth, but we need to talk about this,” he said.
The prosecutor, who was elected to office in November, said he hoped to explicitly address the issue through ongoing community dialogue and via events like the one Monday night.
“We have to just saturate — whether it’s through Facebook, whether it’s through email lists, through our partners in education — about the fact that the first job of the state’s attorney’s office is to protect people,” Rinehart said.
Police and prosecutors, he said, are not running people’s immigration status when they report a crime.
Jackie Herrera Giron, Rinehart’s chief of victim services, said, “The conversation needs to start with the community to let victims know that they can come in and report. Because, without that report happening, we won’t know, justice won’t start.”
Monday’s event was held in an open-sided tent at the Waukegan School District 60 headquarters and was promoted as a town hall focused on informing the Latino community how the state’s attorney’s office is working with nonprofits and other community groups. It was sponsored by Rinehart’s office in conjunction with the school district and several Latinx community organizations."

Latinx nonreligious community grows. Media depictions should reflect that.
By Jessica Xiomara García

Amid increased calls for diversity, the media continues to lean heavily on stereotypes and tropes, making necessary a serious focus on the lack of intersectionality in the representation of Latinx people in popular culture.
Take some examples from pop culture. “Jane the Virgin,” a popular TV series that aired on the CW, was praised for its predominantly Latinx cast. However, its strong Catholic influences (which include the title of the show itself) present issues for its ability to truly represent the whole community.
The Latinx community is often portrayed in the media as a religious monolith, typecast into a Catholic narrative. Although Catholicism has played a cultural and historic role in many of those communities, it doesn’t accurately depict the diverse nature of the Latinx religious landscape. Not all Latinx people are Catholic, or even religious.
It’s time the media made an effort to acknowledge and celebrate the different identities of Latinx people, including the nonreligious. Nonreligious Latinx people do not want to be treated as statistical oddities, but as a growing community of humanists, atheists and free thinkers. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly one in five Latinx people do not identify with any religion.Anthony Cruz Pantojas is the co-chair of the Latinx Humanist Alliance (LHA) (an affiliate of the American Humanist Association), the Humanist Chaplain at Tufts University, and a well-known leader within the secular movement. Cruz’s journey from a religious childhood to his work with interfaith and nonreligious communities is more common than you may think, especially within the Latinx community.
Cruz has always been inquisitive, especially when it comes to the topic of faith. Born and raised in Puerto_Rico, Cruz had a Roman Catholic upbringing, attending services with the rest of his family. As he grew older, however, he knew he wanted to learn what else the world had to offer.
He began to pursue an undergraduate degree in social studies and anthropology, which he credits for his growing interest in other traditions and religions.
The population of nonreligious Latinx Americans is increasing, having risen by 67% within less than a decade. There are now more than 8 million nonreligious Latinx Americans. A portion of that population, 13% of Latinx Americans in general, identify as religiously unaffiliated. The increase in “religious nones” within the Latinx community closely resembles the changing American landscape, where nearly 23% of Americans are nonreligious.
While nonreligious Latinx people exist across all age groups, the population of nonreligious Latinx Americans skews rather young. This indicates that this community is here to stay, and will most likely grow in prominence in the years to come.Latinx adults between the ages of 18 and 29 make up only 20% of the Latinx Catholic community, while 32% of the same age group self-identifies as nonreligious. Many are also choosing to leave religious communities, with 57% of nonreligious Latinx individuals having been raised Catholic and 22% as Protestant. Fourteen percent of the community grew up in nonreligious families, with more and more nonreligious Latinx parents choosing to raise nonreligious children. This trend is intergenerational, and further supports the growing prominence of the nonreligious Latinx community.
Every day, Cruz works to advocate for and raise awareness of the nonreligious Latinx community. “It is my deepest conviction that one of the ways to secure the future of humanism is through service, community and mentorship,” he says of why he decided to join the Latinx Humanist Alliance. “The Latinx Humanist Alliance embodied the possibilities of these three pillars that define my humanist life stance while providing the space for me to continue to grow in these commitments on a daily basis.”
Nonreligious Latinx people are community organizers, students, business owners and writers who seek out compassionate communities for their beliefs. Although there is growing awareness of the general increase in Americans who don’t identify with any religion, nonreligious communities of color are still often overlooked.
The nonreligious community is still largely led and portrayed by an older white demographic, which doesn’t accurately represent the greater population. It’s currently Latinx Heritage Month. America should work toward increasing awareness of nonreligious Latinx Americans to provide a beacon for Latinx nonbelievers who feel isolated within religious communities."

With ‘City of Mirrors,’ Chicago alt-Latinx band Dos Santos lets the light in
By Britt Julious

On what is undoubtedly their most uplifting record yet, Chicago’s Dos Santos tried something a little bit different.
Known for their powerful, eclectic and sonically provocative live shows, the five-member group transported that singular energy of the stage to the studio. Working with musician and producer Elliot Bergman (of Wild Belle), the group crafted an album with the same sort of improvisational spirit that has come to define their concerts. The result is “City of Mirrors,” the band’s latest album out Oct. 15 on Chicago indie label International Anthem.
Work on “City of Mirrors” began well before the pandemic. Although the band estimates they played up to 70 shows in 2019, they also began the writing process for their new record. Accustomed to working among themselves, the band members said they were interested in bringing on Bergman due to their appreciation for his sonics and his keen ear for music.
“He kind of helped us shape some ideas. We bounced around a lot of ideas once in the studio, which we had never done before with Dos Santos,” said Jaime Garza Rodriguez.
Alex Chávez agreed, adding, “The best way to do that is to bring someone else in, who’s outside of you, who can sort of open up avenues for different kinds of creativity or just push you in certain ways.”
Recording began in December 2019. Although they entered the recording process with strong ideas of what they hoped to accomplish, much of that was discarded once they finally connected with Bergman. In the studio, they began to reimagine their sound — and their intentions. How is a song made? What structures are necessary to create a complete product? How can they reimagine what it means to make music as Dos Santos, and furthermore, what it means to make music, period.After writing, recording, mixing and mastering, what made the final cut for “City of Mirrors” didn’t exist prior to the group stepping into the studio and pushing themselves past their previous conventions.
“There was this sort of sheer openness to improvising as a kind of songwriting process,” recalled Chávez. Although the band frequently improvised during their numerous live sets, the studio usually called for a more formal setting. But not with “City of Mirrors.” “We (would) just play and rotate for like half an hour (and) see what happens,” Chávez said. “And then based on that, we would listen back and it’s very hip hop in the sense that when you chop it, you’d be like, ‘Oh, look, this particular section, that’s something right there.’”
Writing became a collage of sounds and playful techniques. And in the end, it redefined their perspective and their purpose with this record. Once the pandemic unfurled, work paused until summer 2020 when the group reconvened to complete recording and mixing. The album was mastered this past fall and winter.
Although much of their work began prior to global lockdowns, the group said the new lessons of the pandemic helped shape the overall message of the record. Every album they have made has had a direction, a heartbeat. On “City of Mirrors,” the group was interested in a message of universality.“We were like, ‘Man, these are dark times. And we need to uplift, and have a positive attitude. We’re gonna get out of this.’ So this kind of sentiment was on our minds,” recalled Garza Rodriguez. All art is derived from the personal, but has the capacity to make much broader social statements. During a time of confusion and tragedy, Dos Santos’ message particularly resonates.
In a statement about the record, the group called “City of Mirrors,” “an assemblage ... glimpses of tradition ... reflections on our collective present ... luminous echoes between love and solitude, hope and absurdity, euphoria and mourning. This album grapples with and transgresses these binaries because we have/and continue to cross borders. Yet, for us, the border is no metaphor — too much real staring back at us.”
Listeners can hear this embodied within seconds on the record. Exuberant and teeming with character, “City of Mirrors” is a record that sonically captures the push and pull of our contemporary world. It is also, just in general, very, very good. Charismatic and sharp, the record is sure to please fans both new and old.
“As artists, we evolve and take everything in perspective and learn from the past,” said Garza Rodriguez. “It’s about kind of seeing the light (at) the end of the tunnel, where we were, for a while, very dark. And now we’re kind of just flowers, the sun, that fresh air. That’s kind of what I feel, at least, when we listen to the album.”"

Latinx residents honored as part of month-long celebration in Aurora
By Steve Lord

Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin and the city government this week recognized a number of Latinx residents as part of Hispanic Heritage Month.
The national celebration spawned a month of different events in Aurora, from mayoral online community conversations to live dedications and presentations. The events were scheduled in part to make up for the COVID-19 cancellation of this year’s Fiestas Patrias parade and celebration.
At this week’s City Council meeting, Irvin presented a variety of groups and individuals with Mayor’s Award of Excellence recognition - called for Hispanic Heritage Month the Mayor’s Awards of LatinXcellence.
Getting awards were Gil Rios, Mariana Martinez, Casildo “Casey” Cuevas, Lisa Garcia and the Latin America Club. These awards were recommended by Ald. Juany Garza, 2nd Ward; they followed awards given Sept. 28 which were recommended by Ald. Emmanuel Llamas, 1st Ward.
Rios is president and owner of GR Enterprises. He has been a youth league baseball coach, a Cub Scout pack leader and is a member of the Aurora Hispanic Heritage Advisory Board. He also founded the Polar Bear golf outing, which raises scholarship money for local students.
Raising money for local students is almost a full-time avocation for Rios, officials said.
“He’s working hard, all the time,” said Garza.
“I come from a humble family, an immigrant family,” Rios said. “My mother told me, when you can do good, do it.”
Martinez has been the community health outreach coordinator at Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora since 2013, as well as a member of Companeros en Salud/Partners in Health and a board member for Alas-Wings, Latina Association for Breast Cancer.
In her work and other associations, Martinez said she has had “the best of both worlds,” getting to work with patients and staff at Rush Copley, and working out in the community too.
Cuevas has long been active in immigrant rights organizations and initiatives, and even said that to accept the award, he had to miss a protest in Chicago this week. He is a former chair of the Fiestas Patrias board, and a former vice chairman of the Aurora Hispanic Heritage Advisory Board.
He said at the council meeting that he still favors Aurora adopting a welcoming city ordinance, and told aldermen he would be back talking to them about it.
“When he says something, he is there,” Garza said.
Garcia was given a special award, the Dee Basile Community Service Award, and got to accept it from Basile herself, who Garcia said is a good friend. Garcia added she only agreed to accept the award because it’s named after Basile.
“If you know me, I hate being in the spotlight, and if you don’t know me, that’s why,” she said.
Basile said she met Garcia more than 20 years ago.
“I was so taken by the energy of this woman,” she said.
Garcia has advocated for the community, as well as for veterans and veterans’ causes. She is also a regular volunteer with the nickname, “Sparkplug.”
The Latin American Club was recognized as one of the oldest Latinx-owned businesses in Aurora, founded in 1959 as a social club.
The facility sponsors and hosts countless benefits and fundraisers to assist individuals and families in Aurora, officials said. Accepting the award was Greg Coronado, president and son of one of the founders, and Vicky Beltran, the treasurer and bar manager.
Beltran said while the club went through a tough period, “we have worked on turning that around.”
“I want to keep it going,” she said."

Chicago Community Trust accelerator awards $7.4M in grants to South, West side initiatives
By Darcel Rockett

Survival has been a focus for businesses during the pandemic, but an initiative of the Chicago Community Trust is hoping to shift the conversation from survive to thrive.
The endeavor, We Rise Together: For an Equitable and Just Recovery, was created a year ago in response to COVID-19, said Gloria Castillo, We Rise Together director. In late September, the accelerator program awarded $7.4 million in grants to 10 real estate developments in eight communities on the city’s South and West sides. The goal of the grants is to help ensure the Black and Latinx communities hit hardest by the pandemic are not left behind.
“We know that by ensuring that these communities are not left behind, we’re actually strengthening the entire region for everyone,” Castillo said. “These are projects that serve as catalysts, because they all will create traffic in their communities so that the small businesses surrounding these hubs are benefiting.”
That’s what grantees Alisa Starks, Daniel Loftus, Perry Vietti and Julia Perkins are counting on. Starks was awarded almost $800,000 for her South Shore development, which will transform the northwest corner of 71st Street and Jeffrey Boulevard into a 47,000-square-foot entertainment and dining space. The space will include a seven-screen, dine-in cinema, a Creole-themed restaurant, an eight-lane bowling and billiards center, and a rooftop event space that she likens to City Winery. For Starks, the grant was timely since construction costs have gone up and building has slowed since the pandemic began.“I have no aspirations to be an AMC. My aspiration is about how best I can be in the community and be a tool for revitalization,” Starks said of her Inner City Entertainment development. “I said, ‘Here’s a business that I can put it in the community.’ We want sit-down restaurants in our neighborhoods, we want to be able to walk to shops, we want all that.” Her target opening date is summer or fall 2023, with the help of her son Ahmad Starks.
Fellow South Shore resident Julia Perkins received over $400,000 from We Rise Together for her Urban Core project, which will include a yoga studio and other health and wellness businesses that promote healthy living. With letters of intent already in hand, Perkins is hoping the renovation of 1840 E. 71st St. will be complete by March 2022. A pivot for Perkins — from longtime consultant to yoga instructor — she wanted to make an accessible, safe space for women and the LGBTQ+ community to meet each other. A small garden on the west side of the building will be used to invite the community in with quarterly events.
“The We Rise Together grant enabled me to do 100% renovation of the property and the build out of the tenant spaces. There are so many disparities out there. I am hopeful that this is the start of a truly rigorous and aggressive amplification of South Shore, and the tremendous assets that it has to offer,” Perkins, proprietor of MBMD Strategic Consultants, said. “I think yoga provides physical and emotional grounding that I wanted to be able to offer to people within my community, especially African American women.”
Daniel Loftus, CEO and president of PODER Learning Center, an integration service center for immigrants, will be using his center’s $1 million grant to finish construction on a brick-and-mortar headquarters in Gage Park. The project means the immigrant integration work that has taken place in five satellite sites with different community partners will move into one central location.
The adaptive reuse project is taking an unused former City of Chicago Bureau of Electricity office and turning it into an immigrant integration and job training center, including English language and workforce development programming and other community and partner resources. Loftus says the new facility, which he expects to open in fall 2022, will almost double PODER’s current clientele to 2,500 a year.
“It can’t be overstated this investment was a game changer for us,” he said. “Successful integration is not easy. Is it about the individual? Of course, but when you talk about economic equity, you talk about this upward mobility. There’s an impact on communities, there’s an impact on families, there’s an impact on local employers, there’s an impact on our city as a whole.”
Vietti, president of Interfaith Housing Development Corp. of Chicago, will be using his group’s $1 million grant to build a 5,200-square-feet space to house a grocery store in Maywood’s affordable housing complex, Fifth Avenue Apartments. The 119 residents in the fully occupied 72-unit building won’t have to go 2 miles north to get groceries once a grocery tenant is identified, Vietti said. It’s a project that’s been in the works for nine years. And while construction won’t begin until a grocer is identified, he’s hopeful that a grocer will be found this calendar year and that the store will attract other development in the community.
“There’s so many communities that just don’t have access to good quality food, this just provides opportunity,” Vietti said. “We’ve been shopping this to grocers since the apartment building opened in February of this year. This grant just takes that cost burden out of the equation for a grocer and makes it so much more financially feasible, especially for somebody from the community.”
“When you look at the investments that we’ve made in this first round of capital grants, you’ll see that every single project, if it’s not community-led, it has had deep, long sustained community engagement. And that’s critically important because we think for those kinds of catalytic projects to really benefit community, community voice has to be there.”
Six other organizations and businesses were awarded grants as part of the We Rise Together initiative. And while these are the first grants awarded, they won’t be the last. The initiative will expand its investment in a portfolio of high-impact real estate development projects through future rounds of funding.
“We identified over 400 organizations and projects that have the potential to fit underneath the We Rise umbrella, and we narrowed that down significantly by looking at whether or not the projects met or were aligned with one of our three goals: increased neighborhood investment, strengthen Black and Latinx businesses and/or increase quality, resilient employment in Black and Latinx communities.” Castillo said. “If you’re going to ensure that this recovery is equitable to the Black and Latinx communities, the earlier you can get neighborhood investments, the better you are because those neighborhood investments will attract other private capital and other entrepreneurs.”"

The data doesn’t lie: Traffic stops reveal age-old biases in Chicago policing
By David Greising

The surge in criminal violence in cities across the country seems to defy easy solutions. But, broadly speaking, courts have agreed on one tactic that should be off-limits: arbitrary and racially inequitable stop-and-frisk policing.
All too often, courts have found, the practice of stopping pedestrians and rifling through their pockets, with no justifiable cause, amounts to a violation of the constitutional right to protection against unreasonable search and seizure.
Perhaps it’s time to bring sharper focus to a related police tactic common in Chicago — traffic stops — that disproportionately affects people of color living in poor neighborhoods.
Recent data from the Illinois Department of Transportation shows that Black drivers got pulled over in Chicago last year at seven times the rate of white drivers. Latinx drivers were pulled over at triple the rate of white drivers.
What’s more, traffic stops overall are up more than sevenfold, to more than 600,000 per year, since a 2015 city settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union designed to rein in abusive stop-and-frisk practices. Black and Latinx drivers accounted for more than 80% of stops in 2019 — significantly out of whack with their roughly 50% share of the city population.And this week, Block Club Chicago put a finer point on the data by breaking it down according to a map of policing districts. The nonprofit news organization found a disproportionate number of traffic stops occur in communities on the South and West sides that are heavily populated by Black residents.
The traffic stop frequency is far lower, Block Club found, in police districts on the Northwest and Southwest Sides where large numbers of Chicago police live.
For example, drivers in the 11th Police District, on the West Side, got pulled over 41,736 times in 2020 — nine times the case count in the 16th District on the Northwest Side.
Race figures into the picture. The population in the 11th District — the heavily policed one — is 85% Black. In the 16th, where far more people live but far fewer stops occur, the population is 69% white.
The data speaks with force. It leads to probing questions about inequities in policing. Is race a factor? Or, regardless of race, do cops cut a break to their neighbors while treating others with suspicion, based on their skin color?
A couple of Chicago aldermen offered answers when Block Club asked for explanations.
Northwest Side Ald. Nicholas Sposato, 38th, shared his view. “White people just know how to talk their way out of a ticket. They just cooperate,” Sposato said.And Ald. Joseph Napolitano, 41st, in a statement observed that people in his ward, which is heavy with residents working in law enforcement, follow traffic rules out of “a profound respect for the rule of law.”
The comments don’t merit any serious scrutiny. But they do show that bias comes from many quarters, including our elected representatives.
And in the face of bias, it’s often helpful to seek out data that shines a light on what’s really happening on the streets.
For example, according to state data, police compound the huge disparity in traffic stops by what they do once drivers pull to the side of the road: They conduct searches on cars driven by Black and Latinx drivers at triple the rate at which they search cars driven by white people.
And what do they find? The state data is mixed, but one category shows that police discover contraband more often in cars driven by white drivers than they do in cars with Black or Latinx drivers at the wheel.
Such police behavior does more than raise questions about racial bias. It also causes understandable resentment and distrust among minority motorists — many of whom have heard “the talk” from their parents, upon getting their driver’s licenses, about the demonstrable physical danger Black and Latinx drivers can face in police traffic stops.
Rachel Murphy has seen how this plays out. She’s an ACLU lawyer who tracks Chicago police compliance with commitments the city made under its 2015 stop-and-frisk settlement with her organization.
“People are being pulled over without any justification to begin with,” Murphy said.
“When you have that experience, you feel targeted and harassed and racially profiled, which obviously is not OK,” she added. “It just shows there are two different policing systems in this city.”
Stop-and-frisk became a favored police tactic beginning in the 1980s, when crime nationwide was rising toward a 1990s peak. It emerged from the so-called “broken windows” approach to policing.
Both tactics were based on a hunch that aggressive and often arbitrary policing would put criminals on notice and prompt them to change their ways. Those false assumptions have been discredited, and the tactics significantly cut back, in the face of data that clearly demonstrated the racial imbalance of police interactions in big cities across the country.Some municipalities are taking the initiative. In Evanston this week, an advisory panel appointed by Mayor Daniel Biss proposed a prohibition on traffic stops based on equipment, license plate or registration violations, and an end to so-called “consent” searches—instead requiring a warrant or probable cause.
That could be a model for Chicago to consider. The data on car stops in Chicago is definitive. The city and its police force should respond definitively, too."

Daniel Anello and Hal Woods: The real reason Chicago Public Schools is losing students
By Daniel Anello and Hal Woods

Chicago Public Schools, the nation’s third-largest school district, has lost more than 100,000 students in the last 20 years — with a decline of more than 40,000 students in the past five years alone.
CPS receives roughly one-third of its annual operating funding from the state of Illinois — with the amount tied to prior years’ enrollment. CPS schools are funded in large part based on the number of students they serve. Declining funding, coupled with rising personnel and facilities costs, adversely affects our schools: fewer discretionary funds for principals to hire librarians, social workers and nurses; educators forced to teach multiple subjects and grades; and students with fewer electives, extracurriculars and school clubs.
If CPS’ enrollment trend is not reversed, both the district and individual schools will be forced to make difficult decisions at a time when we will still be reeling from the academic and social-emotional toll of a multiyear pandemic. It is difficult to fathom a scenario in which student outcomes improve and opportunity gaps close while CPS faces annual revenue declines due to declining student enrollment.
In the new report “Chicago’s Enrollment Crisis,” Kids First Chicago examines the root causes of CPS’ pernicious enrollment decline. Rather than the conventional, and false, narrative that Chicago families are fleeing CPS for nonpublic options, data reveals a market share that has remained consistent over the past 20 years.
Instead, CPS’ enrollment decline is attributable to an unprecedented reduction of school-age children in the city: 360,000 fewer children today compared with 60 years ago and 175,000 fewer children since 2000. These trends — a declining number of school-age children, but a flat or increasing proportion of those children attending public school — mirror national public school enrollment patterns.
The key driver behind Chicago’s decline in school-age children is a decadelong reduction in the number of births in the city. From 2009 to 2019, annual births in Chicago fell from approximately 44,000 to 33,000. That’s 11,000 fewer children attending school each year.
The answer to the decline in births lies in demographic changes in the city’s Hispanic and Black populations, 85% of whom send their children to CPS.
Growth from Chicago’s Latinx population has dramatically decreased in comparison with the late 1990s and early 2000s. This is due to a confluence of declining birthrates, declining immigration from Mexico and increased gentrification. We attribute the decline in birthrates to a variety of factors, including rising child care costs. Declining immigration from Mexico — a national trend that disproportionately affects Chicago due to 3 out of 4 of the city’s Latinx residents being of Mexican or Mexican American descent — is primarily due to stricter U.S. immigration policies and an improved Mexican economy.
Finally, far too many of Chicago’s majority Latinx neighborhoods have experienced gentrification due to development policies that have made it difficult for immigrant families to attain homeownership. These combined factors contributed to CPS schools in the Pilsen and Little Village neighborhoods losing roughly 22% of their student enrollment in the past five years.
What’s needed are coordinated and comprehensive investments and policies that make child rearing less costly. Also necessary are policies that encourage diversity and promote human rights, and establish equitable development to protect vulnerable residents. Without those changes, Chicago will continue to see declining growth in its Latinx population, leading to a further reduction of Latinx students.
The other main factor driving the decline of the city’s school-age population is a generation-long exodus of over a quarter of a million Black Chicagoans. The reasons behind this out-migration are numerous and are rooted in racist systems that deny Black Chicagoans ample access to living-wage employment opportunities, quality education options, affordable housing and health care services.
Kids First found that employment rates for Black Cook County residents have and continue to be dramatically lower in comparison with Black employment rates in surrounding counties — a gap that does not exist for Latinx or white Cook County residents.
There is hope, however. Black Chicagoans who’ve left haven’t traveled far, with the vast majority migrating to the surrounding suburbs and northwest Indiana. If the city’s public and private sectors can enact new policies and investments that bring real equity and opportunity to Black Chicagoans, we believe these families will return to Chicago given the inherent advantages our city possesses.
The future stability and vitality of Chicago is tied to our education system. Chicago’s health relies on keeping current families in the city while also attracting new ones. While no simple solution exists, we do know this: Without a sustained, multisector effort from our city’s government and corporate leaders, community members, residents and philanthropic community, Chicago’s student population will continue to shrink, creating an existential funding crisis for the district and the city."

Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flats are a key source of affordable housing. The pandemic might be changing that.
By Sarah Freishtat

Already disappearing before COVID-19, Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flats, long seen as sources of affordable homeownership and rental opportunities, may emerge from the pandemic with an identity crisis.
The uncertainty of the past two years could alter some of the signature benefits for renters as landlords change their management style to adapt or consider selling altogether, a recent study found.
That would mean one more hurdle for tenants, and one more challenge for communities as the city looks to combat a shortage of affordable housing.
The findings were outlined in a December report by researchers from the American Bar Foundation and the University of Illinois at Chicago, which examined small, independently-owned rental properties in Chicago, such as two- and three-flats. The buildings make up a large portion of the country’s supply of unsubsidized affordable housing, and many of the landlords manage their properties in ways that benefit tenants, such as limiting rent increases, forgoing fees and being more flexible on partial or late payments, according to the study.
But the basis for that management style might be more precarious than it once seemed. As small landlords grapple with financial challenges during the pandemic, some are considering reining in that flexibility.
In interviews with 51 small Chicago-area landlords during the pandemic, researchers found 10 who said they would take steps such as raising rents, adding fees or screening tenants more closely. The researchers referred to that figure as a “sizable minority,” and said the shifts “have the potential to undermine the relative affordability and accessibility” of this type of rental unit.
“When landlords take these shifts to more rigid approaches, they end up passing the risks of this crisis, the financial crisis, onto tenants,” researcher Allison Suppan Helmuth said.
The findings follow a 2021 study from the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University that detailed how Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flats were disappearing even before the pandemic, often replaced with single-family homes or empty lots. The researchers fear the pandemic could hasten the loss of small rental housing and make two- and three-flats less appealing as a path to homeownership.
“This sector of the rental market is really important because: one, it is more affordable, and two, there’s an understanding, somewhat supported by previous research, that landlords have these more flexible, lenient, tenant-friendly practices in this sector,” researcher Anna Reosti said.
Most of the landlords interviewed for the study were two- or three-flat owners, but two other small, independent landlords reported similar trends, they said.
One small owner rethinking being a landlord is Richard Fisk, who began renting out the Barrington condo he owned after he moved out of state for a job.
The tenants living there were behind on rent before the pandemic shutdowns began, Fisk said. He tried to work with them, and thought they would likely leave in March 2020, when their lease expired, he said.
Then the pandemic hit. An eviction moratorium meant the tenants stayed. Fisk lost his tech industry job for a time. And he had a mortgage and homeowners association fees due.
“I try to be flexible with people and not super rigid, and not coming down on people,” he said. “Like, if they miss a month of rent, we’ll figure it out. ... This just put me under an extreme level of pressure financially.”
Eventually, Fisk sought to evict the tenants, and was approved for pandemic rental assistance as part of the court process, he said. With several months of rent covered, the tenants remained in the home, but again fell behind, he said.
Fisk now wants to sell the condo.
“I’ve completely rethought everything,” he said. “I’m going to sell my property and just get out of this. Because at this point if I can’t get the support that I need, I have to do what’s right for my family.”
Other landlords are determined to hold onto their buildings, despite pandemic challenges. Peg Olson, who for more than four decades has owned the West Rogers Park three-flat where she lives, said whether she changes her management philosophy will depend on what the future brings. But she knows she wants to continue helping tenants as much as possible. And she wants to keep her building, because the alternative is to leave her longtime home.
Before the pandemic, she agreed to rent one of her units at a lower-than-usual rate, she said. During the pandemic, the tenant fell behind.
Olson, a former nurse, no longer works regularly so she couldn’t pick up extra shifts to cover her costs, she said. She has had to weigh her grocery list against her bills.
“I still have my mortgage, I still have heating, I still have taxes,” she said.
Olson worked with a Rogers Park organization and received pandemic rental assistance in the second half of 2021, which she said helped her keep her building.
Olson has long completed background checks and researched prospective tenants, but she says she should think more like a businessperson, rather than a nurse. She would like to be able to pay her bills without feeling like she is scraping by.
Still, she wants to try to continue being flexible with tenants.
“I am a nurse, first and foremost,” she said. “People need to be cared for. People need compassion and caring. There’s too much cruelty in the world today. I don’t want to be part of the problem, I want to be part of the solution.”
Olson’s and Fisk’s experiences mirror what the nonprofit homeownership organization Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago has seen, said Chief Operating Officer Donna Clarke. While some small landlords are getting by, others are struggling or pulling rental units off the market, she said.
The study’s findings are a concern for the organization, which has teamed with other groups to try to preserve and rehab two- and four-flats, maintain rental affordability, and help homeowners build wealth.
“I think it ends up pushing out, unfortunately, the Black and Latinx community,” she said. “It makes homeownership that much more difficult for them. It destabilizes their housing. Because a lot of these units are falling in these communities.”
An owner who decides to screen tenants more closely, fearing they might not otherwise be able to pay rent, could make it more difficult for a renter in the country illegally to find a home, she said. Requiring security deposits can be prohibitive for some renters.
But less flexibility on the part of landlords doesn’t have to limit affordability, Clarke said. Formalizing a lease can help both tenants and landlords.
More research will be needed to see what ultimately plays out, Reosti said. More landlords reported changing their management practices toward the end of their research in 2021, and it remains to be seen whether that trend will continue or whether access to more rental assistance will cause it to shift.
Landlords said clearer guidance about rental assistance and stronger mortgage protections would have helped, the study found.
“We heard people say they felt like they were on their own,” Helmuth said.
Eviction mediation programs, which help resolve disputes with tenants before an eviction takes place, have also helped, especially when they include money for rental assistance, Reosti said.
Fisk agreed. He didn’t oppose the moratorium on evictions that kept his tenants in place, but said better communication and consideration of small landlords would have helped. A direct payment program to homeowners could have allowed him to cover his expenses.
“We all go through hard times,” he said. “And for me, this has changed my outlook on ownership and the struggles with that.”"

Chicago teachers ‘pissed off and exhausted’ over mask mandate lifting, but CPS vows to work with union to avoid another work stoppage
By Tracy Swartz and Alice Yin

The head of Chicago Public Schools said Tuesday he does not anticipate a teacher work stoppage from the upcoming removal of the districtwide mask mandate, even as the Chicago Teachers Union swiftly vowed to fight the decision.
During an online question-and-answer session, CPS CEO Pedro Martinez attempted to tamp down concerns of another heated labor dispute, in response to a question on whether lifting the CPS mask requirement violated the city’s COVID-19 safety agreement with the union.
In his characterization of ongoing CPS-CTU relations, Martinez said: “I feel there’s more agreement than disagreement.”
“We’re going to continue to work with CTU; they’re a valuable stakeholder for us, a valuable partner,” Martinez said. “I don’t anticipate more serious consequences in terms of work stoppages, but we will continue to work together.”
But CPS’ announcement this week that it will make masks optional for students and staff members starting Monday has already spurred not just an unfair labor practice complaint from the teachers union — which has decried it as an unilateral violation of its January COVID-19 safety agreement — but also outcry among some parents and an alderman who called the move racist.
Indicative of the union’s distrust of CPS leadership, CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates called Martinez’s claims that the parties agree more than disagree “a big, fat slap in the face when you unilaterally cancel an agreement that you just made.”
During Tuesday’s online forum, Martinez and public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said the decision to lift the mask mandate in CPS was based on the city’s success in beating back the omicron surge and landing at lower COVID-19 transmission risk in recent weeks.
Arwady said if the city returns to a medium level of community spread, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s newest three-tier system, the district will likely recommend masking for unvaccinated students. Should the city move up to the high level of risk, the school mask mandate would return.
Martinez also acknowledged that his reasoning for mask removal partly stems from a lawsuit filed by downstate attorney Thomas DeVore, who has won recent victories in his challenges of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s COVID-19 school policies. Martinez said he feared if the district continued the mask mandate, they could get tangled up in the ongoing litigation and lose broader powers to respond to the pandemic.
“We were concerned about some of the legal challenges, that they could take that authority away from us,” Martinez said.
During an online event Tuesday morning hosted by the group Activate Chicago Parents, however, Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, called the lifting of the mask rule “irresponsible.”
“But more that,” he continued, “it is racist. When we see the levels of vaccination in our communities — and I’ll tell you, as someone who represents the vast majority of residents in Black and brown communities — less than 50%” of CPS students are fully vaccinated.
CTU’s governing body — the 600-member House of Delegates — is scheduled to meet Wednesday, a date that was on the books before CPS’ masking announcement.
It’s unclear if the delegates will take action in response to the CPS masking change.
“I don’t know. They just took action. Why in the hell do we have to keep taking action?” Davis Gates said in a phone interview Tuesday. “We’re not wrong. The only safety policies that we’ve had in this district are the ones our members sacrificed for. The mayor doesn’t have a safety plan. Her doctor doesn’t have a safety plan. The CEO doesn’t have a safety plan. Hell, the Board of Education just reaffirmed the use of face coverings in schools just two weeks ago. They don’t have a plan.”
Davis Gates said CTU members are “pissed off and exhausted” in the wake of the mask announcement.
“Monday, we will struggle. We have immunocompromised students. Are they going to open up the Virtual Academy for those kids? We have immunocompromised workers. Are they going to provide telework accommodations for them?” Davis Gates said. “People sacrificed for an agreement that they signed, and Thomas DeVore said, ‘Hold on for a minute.’ And the mayor of Chicago said, ‘Sure, Thomas,’ while ignoring Black parents and families, while ignoring Latinx parents and families. She did not privilege any community outside of Mount Greenwood.”
A minor dust-up during the parent group’s news conference Tuesday demonstrated how volatile the topic of masking can be.
Bridgett White, parent of two CPS students, decried the district’s decision as prioritizing the economy over public health.
“A pandemic does not go away just because you want it to, just because you’re tired of it. The numbers were rising just after Christmas break. We were at the highest that we were almost at the beginning of the pandemic,” White said. “The numbers began to go down, and we are just a few weeks out from that. You don’t pull the masks just because people are tired of wearing the masks.”
Several parents echoed White’s concerns during the virtual event for Activate Chicago Parents, a group that has been calling on the district to increase COVID-19 safety protocols and to institute a student vaccine requirement for the upcoming school year. But one woman who identified herself as a CPS substitute teacher worried that in light of the change in the masking policy, CTU members would again refuse in-person work, as they did in January, which prompted the district to cancel classes for five days.
“We are causing fear in our children that’s (misplaced), and the parents are doing it to the kids, and the teachers are doing it to the kids,” she said. “It’s wrong. There’s nothing wrong. If you want to go to school wearing a mask, wear your mask. If you want to have remote learning, you have an option, home-school.”
Dr. Howard Ehrman, a medical professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former city health official, criticized CPS’ COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including its weekly testing program that weathered many delays. He said the district’s vaccination efforts have been poorly organized.
“Don’t make this sound bite either the pandemic’s over or this is a mild disease. This is not a mild disease,” Ehrman said.
The substitute teacher interjected as Ehrman spoke, and then she disappeared from the call.
“I don’t split hairs. Let me be clear, and I’m sorry this woman left,” parent Jesù Estrada said. “We cannot control when the CTU goes on strike. What we’re calling for are specific days where we have sickouts. This is the only time that the mayor has actually sat with parents, is when we had the one sickout.”
As for the CTU’s unfair labor complaint, a representative for the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board said an investigator has been assigned to look into it. It’s possible the investigation could be completed this week, and the complaint could land on the agenda for the board’s monthly meeting, scheduled for March 16.
Meanwhile, DeVore said Thursday’s hearing on his request for a temporary restraining order against CPS with regards to masks will no longer be necessary since the district is relaxing its rules. His litigation against scores of Illinois school districts is still pending, and he said he is prepared to take action if the children of his clients are forced to stay home from their CPS schools because they tested positive for the virus or if they are unvaccinated and came in contact with an infected person.
“As soon as they try that, we will absolutely drag them back into court,” said DeVore, who represents about half a dozen CPS parents, with 100 to 120 more CPS parents prepared to join his efforts.
Martinez and Mayor Lori Lightfoot defended the district’s lifting of the mask mandate Monday by pointing to declining CPS and Chicago case numbers and low test positivity.
The Chicago Board of Education reaffirmed CPS’ mask mandate just two weeks ago, at its February board meeting, saying the student vaccination rate varies widely between the hundreds of CPS schools. About half of age-eligible CPS students and more than 91% of district staff are fully vaccinated, according to CPS data.
For students who are medically vulnerable, Martinez said the district will “find ways” for them to learn with accommodations, such as remote learning.
Illinois recently ended its statewide school mask mandate to align with guidance from the CDC, and Chicago lifted the requirement for most public spaces as well.
During Tuesday’s “Ask Arwady” session, the city’s top doctor also chimed in with her views on the relationship between the city and teachers union, delivering a pitch for cooperation and to “follow the science.” She said she was “worried” about society’s fraying trust in certain professions such as doctors, government officials — and teachers.
“We’ve also seen trust of teachers drop a lot and that just hurts me,” Arwady said. “It’s so critical that we together are rebuilding the trust that society has in our workforces, in the people who educate our kids. … What does that mean? That means working, I hope, together.”
Bob Bruno, a University of Illinois labor professor who wrote a book about the 2012 CTU strike, said the union has a “pretty good case” before the state labor panel because of the January safety agreement.
The two sides will “fight in front of the board, but I think they will continue to figure out how to get into this next phase (of the pandemic) in a way that works for both parties,” Bruno said. “Now whether or not it contributes to further long-term grudges? Well, I guess that remains to be seen, but I think they’ll figure it out.”"

Waubonsee Community College opens Latinx Resource Center
By Megan Jones

Not many community colleges in Illinois have the resources to create a center devoted to just its Latinx students, Franklin Ortega-Palaguachi of Waubonsee Community College said.
But many students at the school will benefit from the new space at Waubonsee’s downtown Aurora campus to feel represented within the college, he said.
Waubonsee is ahead of the game, Ortega-Palaguachi said, with the opening this week of the Latinx Resource Center that he will help manage. Resources at the center include a peer-to-peer mentoring program that focuses on helping students develop professionally, mentally and academically, and free “Colegio de Empoderamiento” programming, focused on helping families and prospective students learn about higher education.
The center is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. A grand opening ceremony for the center will take place from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Waubonsee’s Aurora downtown campus at 18 S. River St. Students will be able to see the space and hear about resources the center offers.
The space features a mural by Aurora artist Pierre Lucero inspired by historic images of the roots of Latino America. Lucero will talk about the meaning behind the mural at the grand opening, Ortega-Palaguachi said.
Waubonsee alum Diana Iracheta, a first-generation Mexican immigrant, will speak about STEM education and Latinas in engineering at the event.
“We want an opportunity for our students to meet other peers, create new initiatives in collaboration with our Latinx community at Waubonsee and Aurora and make sure students have an opportunity to feel represented and included,” Ortega-Palaguachi said.
Waubonsee received a designation as a Hispanic-serving institution in 2009 and is one of three colleges in Illinois, and the only community college in the state, to receive Title V grants to expand educational opportunities for Hispanic and low-income students, Dean for Institutional Effectiveness and Title V Project Director Stacey Randall said.
“After seeing the changing demographics of our institution, we felt it was a great acknowledgment of that,” Randall said. “As we started to talk about what being a Hispanic-serving institution meant and what Title V funding was for, we started to engage with students more and talk to them about what was needed.”
Randall said many students said they’d love to have a space that would give them a sense of community. She began researching what creating such a space would entail and after Waubonsee received an additional grant in 2020, officials began hiring a team to put together the resource center."

Chicago’s undocumented seniors face slim and dangerous housing options
By Laura Rodríguez Presa and Carlos Ballesteros

In the three days before Lilia had to vacate her basement apartment last summer, she cried herself to sleep each night. Her husband, Cipriano, 70, was in a hospital bed recovering from an emergency amputation of his left foot due to gangrene complications. But their landlords of more than a decade told Lilia, 69, it was time for them to go. And without a lease, she had no choice but to oblige.
“I packed all of our things by myself,” she said in a recent interview, wiping away tears.
“Estabamos practicamente en la calle.” We were practically on the street, she said.
(Injustice Watch and the Chicago Tribune agreed to identify Lilia and Cipriano only by their first names because they are in the country without authorization and fear retaliation from immigration authorities.)After an ambulance picked up Cipriano in September, the landlords told Lilia it was time for them to move out. A city inspector was on the way, they told her, and the basement unit, for which they paid $500 a month, didn’t have a second exit, making it illegal to rent. The inspector never showed up, Lilia said, but the landlords didn’t relent, and the couple vacated the basement by the end of the month.
With the help of a community organizer, the couple was able to find a new apartment in West Humboldt Park, the same neighborhood they’d lived in since immigrating from Mexico a little over 30 years ago. Their new landlord charges them $700 a month for a sunny second-floor unit in a classic Chicago two-flat, well below market rate.
But the couple isn’t able to work anymore; Lilia suffers from arthritis and asthma attacks — a byproduct of living in a musty basement for so long, she said — and Cipriano’s amputation has him sidelined until he can learn to walk with a prosthetic leg. And even then, he’s not sure he’ll be able to find sustainable work at his age and with his new disability.
Without any assets, savings or Social Security Disability Insurance, they now depend on their only daughter — an undocumented housekeeper and a single mother to four kids — to pay for their rent, food and everything else.
“My daughter is paying for everything, which is why I understand that her world is also shutting down on her,” Lilia said. “I understand that she is stressed because this was not supposed to be her responsibility. It was our responsibility to save enough for ourselves, but we couldn’t.”
“La vejez se nos vino encima,” Lilia said. “Old age crept up on us.”
Lilia and Cipriano are members of a rapidly growing demographic in Illinois: Undocumented immigrants age 65 and older. The population of undocumented seniors is expected to grow from about 4,000 in 2017 to more than 55,000 by 2030, according to estimates from demographer Rob Paral published in a recent Rush University Medical Center report.
Many older adults without legal status can’t afford a place of their own and are disqualified from federally-funded senior housing. Undocumented immigrants also have a harder time buying a home than citizens, which in turn prevents them from them building generational wealth through real estate — often the only way working-class families can build wealth, especially Black and Latinx households.
As a result, undocumented seniors often depend on their families to have a roof over their head. About three-quarters of seniors without legal status live with younger family members in multigenerational households, compared to only about a quarter of citizen seniors, according to Paral.Burdening their children and families with having to take care of them in their later years can elicit feelings of shame and guilt in undocumented seniors, said Cecilia Ayón, a public policy analyst at the University of California, Riverside, who recently interviewed dozens of undocumented older adults as part of her research.
“When it comes to retirement, you have to think about the intersection of how long can they work for and how much of a burden they want to be on their children. Because that’s actually how they talked about it — they don’t want to be a burden on their children,” she said.
Expected to do more with less
Lilia and Cipriano said they intended to buy a home at some point. But those plans withered away after Lilia became too sick to work about 10 years ago. “We had no savings. We barely managed to get by,” Cipriano said.
Only about a third of undocumented immigrants in Illinois own the homes they live in, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, compared with two-thirds of Illinois residents overall.
Legally speaking, there’s nothing stopping unauthorized immigrants from buying a house. In the late 1990s, the IRS began issuing individual taxpayer identification numbers, or ITINs, to immigrants and foreigners so they could pay taxes on their earnings. And in 2001, Congress allowed banks to issue mortgages to people with ITINs.
But immigrants without legal status have to clear a much higher bar than citizens to buy a home. ITIN mortgages often come with interest rates that are about twice what a typical citizen borrower has to pay despite having lower delinquency rates than typical borrowers. ITIN mortgages also require a full 20% down payment, while some citizen borrowers can secure a mortgage with a down payment as low as 3%.
But undocumented tenants often lack the required documents that landlords ask for to sign a lease, like photo IDs or a credit history. That means most undocumented tenants pay their rent month-to-month, putting them at risk of being easily evicted, as landlords in Illinois only need to give them 30 days notice to leave their home.
“A lot of these families are financially strained, and their kids, if they’re also undocumented, their options for jobs will also be limited. It takes a while to really become financially stable, and if you’re undocumented, it’s hard to do that,” Ayón said.
Because it’s so hard to buy a home, the majority of undocumented immigrants — like Lilia and Cipriano — are renters.“I’ve seen so many immigrant tenants constantly forced out or evicted from apartment buildings,” said Antonio Gutierrez, co-founder of the Autonomous Tenants Union in Albany Park.
Undocumented seniors who’ve been forced out of their apartments have a hard time finding a new place to live that’s within their budget, especially in gentrifying areas of the city like Albany Park, Gutierrez said.
That means undocumented seniors often end up living in dangerous and squalid conditions, especially in below-ground units that are deemed illegal by the city of Chicago, said Juan Cruz, an organizer with Communities United, a grassroots social justice group also based in Albany Park. Cruz helped Lilia and Cipriano find their new apartment.
“We know, especially in the immigrant and undocumented community, often times basement units are the most affordable,” he said.
In her lowest moments, alone in her old basement unit with no food to eat and not a penny to her name, Lilia said she thought about going back to Mexico. “But I couldn’t bear leaving my daughter to take care of my husband,” after his surgery, she said.
Family ties are often what keep undocumented seniors from going back to their home countries, said Jennifer Van Hook, a sociologist at Penn State University whose research centers on aging immigrant communities. “The longer they stay (in the U.S.), the more of their family lives here and not abroad,” she said. “And of course, people want to live close to their children and their grandchildren as they get older.”
Undocumented seniors also have a hard time deciding to go back home empty-handed, said Dan Pogorzelski, a community organizer in Chicago who works with Polish immigrants, who make up the second-largest group of unauthorized seniors in Illinois after Mexican immigrants.“Some people who emigrated here many years ago, to save face, write back to Poland, and give the impression that they’re living a great life here, because they’re embarrassed that things did not end up the way that they had hoped. So people will have no idea of what dire straits they might be in,” Pogorzelski said.
Risk of homelessness without public housing
Undocumented seniors who don’t have family to fall back on are highly susceptible to ending up homeless, said Patti Prunhuber, a housing attorney at Justice in Aging, a legal advocacy organization based in Oakland, California, working to end senior poverty.
“Undocumented immigrants … can’t look ahead to being able to retire and have enough income to pay for their housing. So they’re struggling while they’re working. And then they really have no fall back once they stop working, unless they have a family member who can rescue them,” she said.
For undocumented seniors at risk of homelessness, the road to stability can’t be found in the usual taxpayer-funded channels. Undocumented seniors are barred from living in public housing units dedicated to people over 65 years old in Illinois. And although they can qualify for Section 8 housing vouchers if they live with citizens, immigrant rights organizers and housing organizers say that public housing authorities in Chicago and across the state have done a poor job making these resources available to mixed-status families.
In 2019, the Chicago Housing Authority said in a letter to the Department of Housing and Urban Development that it served only 47 mixed-status families made up of 190 family members across its 22,000-unit portfolio. In contrast, housing authorities in New York City and Los Angeles told HUD they served more than 11,000 family members in mixed-status households.
Similarly, an analysis of 2017 HUD data by the National Housing Law Project found that Illinois public housing authorities served only 140 mixed-status families, or less than 1% of its total caseloads — a rate lower than other states with large public housing portfolios such as California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia.
“I think that the data really just shows that immigrants have not been prioritized in the city for affordable housing programs, by the Chicago Housing Authority and other housing authorities in the area,” said Emily Coffey, a housing attorney at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the CHA said the agency “has made improvements in our outreach to underrepresented racial and ethnic groups” and that it will “continue to look for innovative new ways to serve more members of the Chicago community.”
Undocumented seniors also have a hard time accessing the affordable housing resources that are made available to them through local nonprofit providers. To qualify, applicants often have to prove that they’re living below the poverty line through pay stubs and tax forms, a tough ask for undocumented seniors who work in the cash-based informal economy, like street vendors.
That was the barrier for 78-year-old Ananias Ocampo, a longtime street vendor and a fixture in Pilsen who lived in a makeshift one-room apartment without a kitchen or proper heating behind a restaurant on 18th Street.
Ocampo could not qualify for housing subsidies because his income was made in cash and he is self-employed. And because he earned way less than $12,400 — the minimum for filing taxes for single people 65 and older — he didn’t have tax records that could prove he met the income requirements.
After helping Ocampo get a much-needed knee surgery, Hilda Burgos, a Chicago immigration advocate and now Ocampo’s caretaker, pushed community and city leaders to find a way to allow Ocampo to qualify for an affordable and dignified place to live.
Inspired by Ocampo’s story, the Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust Fund, a public-private organization that provides rental subsidies to low-income city residents, implemented a new policy that allows individuals who work in the informal economy to self-certify their income.
But housing advocate Janece Ortiz said “there’s still a long way to go to ensure that undocumented elders can access these resources.”
Ortiz is the program director at LUCHA, a Chicago-based, HUD-approved housing counseling agency that launched a workshop series to help immigrant households access public housing resources they qualify for.
“We’ve seen a significant gap in the communities we serve accessing the multitude of resources offered by the CHA, as well as very limited information available regarding guidelines for families with mixed-immigration status to access such resources,” said LUCHA’s executive director, Lissette Castañeda.
Wishing for an affordable place to live
Like many undocumented immigrants, Cipriano found work through temp agencies. Lean and barrel chested with a well-kept salt and pepper mustache, Cipriano mostly worked as a janitor at factories and event spaces in the suburbs, earning minimum wage.
But his work dried up when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. As the couple’s savings slowly started to disappear, Lilia tried to get her hands on monetary aid that some community organizations and the city offered for immigrants who didn’t qualify for the federal stimulus checks.
But she couldn’t find anything. “No sabía hacer los papeles por que no se leer,” she said. The elderly woman had a hard time submitting any paperwork because she couldn’t read or write. Instead, she began to sell food during the weekends — mole, pozole and tamales — to make enough to pay rent.
Lilia and Cipriano had yet to reach rock bottom. Last summer, as their landlords started to threaten them with eviction, Cipriano’s health took a turn for the worse. A sharp pain developed on the toes on his left foot. A trip to the emergency room revealed that Cipriano, who has diabetes, had developed gangrene. Doctors amputated his left foot to stop the disease from spreading.
As Cipriano lay in a hospital bed with his daughter by his side, Lilia was busy packing all of their belongings from their basement apartment as their landlords forced her to leave. “They took out the stove; they took out the microwave. … I didn’t have anything to eat,” she said.
With no one else to turn to, Lilia called Cruz, the organizer with Communities United, at the behest of a neighbor. Cruz helped Lilia procure food donations and also helped the couple apply for a one-time grant for immigrant families who didn’t qualify for federal stimulus checks funded by private foundations and local and state governments
The application went through, and the family received a debit card loaded with $4,000. Without thinking twice, Lilia handed the debit card over to her daughter to help cover the security deposit and about two months of rent on their new apartment.
After that money ran out, it was up to their daughter to pay for everything, big and small — rent, bills, food, medicine, quarters for the laundromat.
Lilia and Cipriano are grateful to their daughter, but they know their current situation is not sustainable. Cipriano said he wants to find work again, but he’s afraid no one will hire a 70-year-old with a prosthetic leg. Lilia wonders what will happen when their daughter can no longer afford to pay for their apartment."

‘Ambulance’ review: a little ‘Speed,’ some ‘Collateral’ and ‘Heat,’ with Screamin’ Jake Gyllenhaal at the wheel
By Michael Phillips

Director Michael Bay’s “Ambulance” celebrates Los Angeles as a shining city build on a cloverleaf of speed, concrete, yelling, automatic gunfire (sorry, pal, not in the mood) and rugged American individualism on both sides of the law. At weird intervals the action cuts away to a fluttering faceful of U.S. flag, as a reminder of where we are and who we are, and what the movie’s selling: national pride in a certain kind of mediocre action picture.
None of the collisions, Gatling gun massacres (again, not in the mood) or SWAT sniper stare-downs in “Ambulance” can compete with Jake Gyllenhaal’s popeyed, this-guy-goes-to-11 dramatics in the role of the turtlenecked bank robber under pressure, a character whose heist management style tends toward hammering repetition of simple commands. There are many, many scenes in “Ambulance” where Gyllenhaal tightens the screws on someone to hurry up, and the dialogue defaults to variations on “Go. Will you go? Now!!! You have 45 seconds! GET GOING!!!” It’s like the Michael Bay version of Dr. Seuss’s “Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!”Without all the yakkity, “Ambulance” would very likely run about 80 minutes, not 136. The 2005 Danish film on which first-time feature film screenwriter Chris Fedak rebuild this vehicle ran, in fact, 80 minutes. That’s nearly an extra hour, or a lost one, depending on your enjoyment level.
Danny, the sociopathic Steve McQueen wannabe played by Gyllenhaal, has one Last Big Score in his sights: a bank heist worth $32 million. His adoptive brother Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), an Afghan War veteran, needs $231,000 for his wife’s experimental cancer surgery. Reluctantly, Will joins Danny’s crew.
The heist goes sideways; Danny hijacks an ambulance because the name of the movie is “Ambulance”; luckily for the city at large and several of those maimed along the way, the infallible emergency medical technician played by Eiza González, is “the best paramedic in town.”
So much more here! There’s the brutal Latinx gang lord who will stop at nothing to settle a score or deal with family the same way he deals with the cops. There’s a mid-car chase front-seat fistfight between the brothers. There’s impromptu gunshot-wound stomach surgery, with paramedic Cam sticking her hands in a wounded cop’s innards while FaceTiming with doctors on a golf course for step-by-step advice. There’s a large, flatulent dog (belonging, in reality, to director Bay) brought along for the manhunt by the LAPD Man of Steel played by Garret Dillahunt.
It’s a modestly scaled movie by Bay standards, if Bay standards begin with the “Transformers” eternities and then slide down from there. Now and then a sharp, gleaming composition clicks into place: three police SUVS screeching to a halt just so, for example, or one of the copious drone camera shots scooting along behind the actors, or just above or below some signage in a nifty way.
Problem is, Bay and his breathless editing relay team of Doug Brandt, Pietro Scalia and Calvin Wimmer lack any sort of visual strategy or rhythm. Before long the ground-level zip-along filming approach turns the cameras into a pack of invisible hunting dogs. No one moment, or assault, or eyebrow-to-chin seething session in close-up, looks or feels more urgent or vital than any other moment in “Ambulance.” When a movie refuses to vary its pace, the audience subconsciously starts to mistrust the information and the exertions on the screen. Are these people overcompensating? Why is a movie that could’ve should’ve been 90 minutes, tops (see “KIMI” for reference, and for a really good high-velocity thriller), refusing to quit long past quitting time?
Michael Bay is no Michael Mann, and he’s not trying to be, but “Ambulance” travels a lot of highway traveled earlier by Mann in “Heat” and “Collateral.” Or even Jan de Bont’s “Speed.” Now that was a dumb movie worth seeing. Bay tries for levity in “Ambulance” — the Danish original tried for a lot more — but there’s no room for levity here. What good is a movie that can’t stop moving, or screaming, long enough to pace itself?"

Rockers Dos Santos tour ‘City of Mirrors,’ the ‘prophetic’ album they wrapped in 2020. They play Schubas this weekend.
By Hannah Edgar

“Sing something.”
When producer Elliot Bergman issued that directive to Dos Santos frontman Alex Chávez during a recording session some two years ago, it was much easier said than done. The band was in the studio late that night, collectively wired by a Mellotron-driven groove dreamed up by Chávez’s four bandmates: drummer Daniel Villarreal-Carrillo, bassist Jaime Garza, percussionist Peter “Maestro” Vale and guitarist Nathan Karagianis.
Maybe it was the lack of sleep. Maybe it was something in the room. Whatever it was, Chávez reflexively began singing an arching melody from his youth over the instrumentals: “La Azucena,” a song from the huapango huasteco musico-poetic tradition of northeastern Mexico with many variants.
“My first impulse was to sing those traditional verses,” Chávez says. “Besides a bridge I wrote myself, that’s pretty much what ended up in the final version.”
That seamless union between traditional and bleeding-edge sounds defines much of Dos Santos’s “City of Mirrors,” the album that grew from those recording sessions. Its musical embodiment of latinidad sounds like little else in Chicago music, much less the catalog of indie-jazz label International Anthem, which released the album last October.
Chávez, an anthropology professor at the University of Notre Dame, has lived in the Midwest for more than a decade. Even so, he still describes himself as a “newcomer” to Chicago’s música Latina scenes, at least in comparison to his bandmates. He grew up in Midland, Texas, then lived in Austin for a decade while studying at the University of Texas — first as an undergraduate, then for his graduate work studying huapango arribeño, a cousin of the huapango huasteco tradition he grew up hearing.
Chávez was agog at Austin’s vibrant Latinx music scene, especially its more experimental fringes. But when he landed in the Midwest and started exploring Chicago’s analogue, he found few groups pursuing the envelope-pushing sounds he’d heard there.
“I mean, Chicago is one of the most Latinx cities in the country,” Chávez says. “I had a strong sense of what a band like Dos Santos could be. I wasn’t interested in just getting together and jamming.”
From there, the group coalesced around Chávez and drummer Villarreal-Carrillo, who’d cut his teeth in punk and rock projects in his native Panama. Chávez already moved in similar circles as Garza, who played in Mexican folk groups and rock bands. Villarreal-Carrillo connected with Vale, who’d pursued dance and music while growing up in Humboldt Park and Logan Square’s Puerto_Rican enclaves. They met at a salsa gig, Vale having returned to music years later after raising his own children.
The band played its debut at a Pilsen gallery nearly a decade ago, an occasion the group hardly remembers now. Dos Santos’s original guitarist left after the band’s self-titled debut album in 2015; Villarreal-Carrillo pulled in Karagianis after collaborating on an indie-rock project.
Dos Santos’s ranks have remained static ever since, but its sound is ever on the move. The band struck upon its most recent aesthetic — traditional rhythmic architectures shredded and re-quilted together, Chávez’s voice distinctively breathy and blooming into a butter-smooth falsetto — with 2018′s “Logos,” also their International Anthem debut.
“Dos Santos’s concept, to me, was always clear. From there, the sound would become whatever it would become,” Chávez says.
“I think the bottom line is, we just don’t want to do whatever it is we did last time,” Vale adds, to affirmative chuckles from the rest of the band. “Like, my mom even says that when she goes to our gigs. ‘You didn’t do a “Corre Caballo 2″ (the lead track off Dos Santos’s first album)?’ ‘No, Mom!’”
“City of Mirrors” is easily the band’s most radical transformation yet, in part because of the addition of Bergman, the multi-instrumentalist and artist who oversaw the studio sessions. Villarreal-Carrillo had played congas with Bergman’s brother-sister duo Wild Belle and knew he was a longtime Dos Santos fan. The quintet pulled him on board, prizing his within-but-without vantage point and expansive ear.
“Elliot created stuff on ‘City of Mirrors’ whole-cloth,” Chávez says.
Lyrically, “City of Mirrors” nods to the band’s literary predilections, with direct textual references to Gabriel García Márquez (the title track takes its name from the final lines of “One Hundred Years of Solitude”) and Gabriela Mistral (heard reading her own verse in the lean, brooding “Jaguar de Rosas”). On “Soledad,” Villarreal-Carrillo dictates lines from fellow Panamanian Ricardo Miró's 1914 poem, “Yo estoy enfermo de soledad” (“I am sick of solitude”) over cumbia rhythms.
Spookily, Villarreal-Carrillo selected and recorded Miró's poem before lockdown. “City of Mirrors” was mostly in the bag by March 2020, when the band was recording final takes and the reality of the U.S.’s impending shutdown was beginning to sink in. “Soledad” and other songs — like “Cages and Palaces,” which rails against literal and legal barriers circumscribing the lives of undocumented immigrants — took on a sobering double meaning.
“A lot on the album ended up being almost prophetic,” Chávez says.
Now, Dos Santos is touring “City of Mirrors” for the first time since the album’s release, in a much different world than the one in which it was recorded. When band members spoke to the Tribune at International Anthem’s headquarters in Bridgeport, they were fresh from a Midwest tour and about to embark on a California leg. The band will also perform at Schubas Tavern in Chicago on April 23.
And after that? In true Dos Santos fashion, the future is wide-open. Though still sitting on unreleased material from the “City of Mirrors” sessions, the band wants its magnum opus to get its chance in the sun before returning to the studio.
“We still haven’t even played some of the songs from ‘City of Mirrors’ live yet,” Garza says.
Whatever happens next, one thing is certain. Chávez’s goal — to solder the musical influences of Dos Santos’ members into a unified, original sound — has come to pass, and then some.
“I always tell people what we’re doing isn’t ‘fusion.’ We’re boiling all these influences together,” Chávez says."

Review: ‘Carmela Full of Wishes’ invites audiences at Chicago Children’s Theatre to see the world through her eyes
By Emily McClanathan

With the help of a fluffy dandelion, a child’s vivid imagination takes flight in “Carmela Full of Wishes,” a world premiere stage adaptation of the book by Matt de la Peña and illustrated by Christian Robinson. Now playing at Chicago Children’s Theatre, this heartwarming tale of an exuberant Latina girl celebrates family, community and hope — perfect themes for young audiences and pandemic-weary caregivers in search of meaningful in-person activities.
Patrons who arrive early to the West Loop venue will find an inviting lobby space where children can create a simple craft that later becomes a collective prop during the show. Upon entering the theater, the vibrant colors of the set (designed by Regina García) transport the audience into a whimsical storybook setting, with an urban landscape rendered in a style evocative of a watercolor painting. Blue and red electric lights represent telephone wires, complete with birds perched on top, while a streetlight and fire hydrant stand in opposite corners.
Carmela, the eponymous dreamer, makes her entrance on a scooter that she will use throughout the show, zooming up and down between the seats that line the stage on two sides. Giddy with excitement that she is turning 7 today, Carmela announces that one of her dearest wishes has come true: she is now old enough to visit the laundromat with her older brother.
Colombian actress Maria Clara Ospina plays Carmela in an open, engaging manner, with every emotion dialed up to full blast, which suits the ages of both the character and the audience. Carmela’s costume (by Jazmin Aurora Medina) includes a tutu worn over red leggings with colorful sneakers, aiding in the suspension of disbelief required when an adult performer plays a child. In the role of Carmela’s brother, Juan Gonzalez Machain leans into the impatience often provoked by a tag-along sibling, although it eventually becomes clear that he loves his little sister.
As the pair travels to the laundromat, stopping for various errands along the way, Carmela introduces the audience to the sights, sounds and smells of her neighborhood, a largely Latinx community in an unspecified city or town. Chicago-based Texican playwright Alvaro Saar Rios, who adapted the book for the stage, weaves Spanish into the dialogue in a way that feels authentic to the characters yet accessible to English-speaking audiences. Michelle Lopez-Rios, his wife and longtime collaborator, directs this production.
When Carmela finds a white dandelion growing along the sidewalk, she struggles to decide which wish to make before blowing its seeds into the breeze; her active imagination presents too many options to narrow down. This plot device leads to a series of episodes in which Carmela’s wishes come to life on stage — ranging from childish visions of candy to deeply held dreams of a better life for her family.
We learn that the children’s Mami (Jasmin Cardenas) works long hours in an expensive hotel, while their Papi (Christopher Alamo) is a migrant worker who is currently absent, having been born in a different country and in need of proper documentation to come home to his wife and kids. In one of her daydreams, Carmela wishes for a luxurious bed for her sleep-deprived Mami; in another, she imagines being reunited with her Papi and singing their favorite song together. Seeing the family’s difficulties through the eyes of optimistic Carmela, sorrow is tempered with hope.
“Carmela Full of Wishes” marks the second time Chicago Children’s Theatre has adapted a book by de la Peña and Robinson, following the 2018 world premiere play “Last Stop on Market Street,” which since has been produced by nearly a dozen U.S. theaters. These productions are part of a broader effort by the theater, under the leadership of artistic director Jacqueline Russell, to bring diverse, contemporary voices from children’s literature to the stage in world premiere plays and musicals, many of which go on to be performed in other cities.
Chicago Children’s Theatre also works to make theater more widely available to local students, partnering with Chicago Public Schools to provide free and reduced-price tickets to under-resourced schools. In addition to its work on stage, the theater offers virtual learning resources on its YouTube channel and in-person performing arts and STEAM educational programs for children up to age 14.
“Carmela Full of Wishes” is open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays, with weekday performances for schools and other groups. While children ages 5-10 are the prime audience for this production, the theater welcomes patrons of any age; the opening performance held the attention of several younger children throughout its 65-minute run time. With its picture book visuals, charming cast, strong Latina protagonist and universal themes, “Carmela Full of Wishes” is well worth an outing for anyone with a little person in their life."

Two years and counting into the pandemic, Chicago looks at how COVID-19 has affected the racial life expectancy gap. ‘The news is not good,’ Dr. Arwady says.
By Darcel Rockett

Follow the numbers. We knew that residents in certain ZIP codes lived shorter lives than others in different ZIP codes within the same city. (An NYU School of Medicine 2019 analysis found a 30-year life expectancy gap between those who live in the Streeterville and Englewood neighborhoods.) And that was before the COVID pandemic. As time went on, more stories about safety, violence and systemic racism added to that conversation.
The Chicago Department of Public Health reported the life expectancy dropped almost two years from 2019-2020, the first year of the pandemic. Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the city’s Department of Public Health, announced an update on life expectancy in Chicago on Monday morning. According to the agency, this is one of the sharpest single-year decreases in life expectancy on record and the steepest declines for Black and Latinx Chicagoans, with COVID-19 driving those numbers. Life expectancy declines were seen in all races and nearly all community areas. Findings include:
As of 2020, the gap in life expectancy between Black and white Chicagoans was 10 years, up from 8.8 years in 2017. For the first time in decades, life expectancy for Black residents of Chicago fell below 70 years (the majority of those communities exist on the South Side);
Chicago Latinx residents saw a more than a three-year drop in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020, the steepest decline for any group, and have lost a total of seven years of life expectancy since 2012;
Asian/Pacific Islander life expectancy showed a two-year drop from 2019 to 2020, while white Chicagoans’ life expectancy declined by one year;
18-to 44-year-old Chicagoans experienced a 45% increase in death rates from 2019, outpacing 65+ Chicagoans (30% increase) despite COVID’s severe impact on the population;
Black Chicagoans experienced a higher rate of infant mortality while rates for other groups dropped sharply.“We are looking at the direct and indirect impacts of COVID on Chicago and the news is not good,” Arwady said. “Even before COVID the CDPH had made a decision to focus on life expectancy. ... I think it is the strongest indicator of a community’s health as well as opportunities. Even before COVID, there was a major life expectancy gap here in Chicago. In the first year of 2020, not only did we see life expectancy drop for all Chicagoans — all races and ethnicities — but we saw that gap widen for Black Chicagoans on average living about 10 years less than white Chicagoans and life expectancy for Black Chicagoans falling below 70 years for the first time in many years. This is not just about COVID, it’s not just about health care. It’s about opportunities and root causes and in addition to that, we also saw Latinx Chicagoans get hit really hard with COVID, with the biggest drop in life expectancy among Latino Chicagoans within that first year. We see this as sobering data.”
COVID-19 was a significant driver of decreases in life expectancy, but so were chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Homicide; infant mortality; HIV, flu, and other infections; and opioid overdoses factored into the racial life expectancy gap as well.CDPH’s Healthy Chicago 2025, a five-year action plan, was created to help close the gap. Launched in 2020, CDPH has committed $30 million to establish Healthy Chicago Equity Zones to strengthen community infrastructure and neighborhood networks so people most affected by inequities have the power and resources to promote health and racial equity in their communities and citywide. Other initiatives working in concert with the zoned strategy is “Dr. Taylor’s Table,” a biweekly (every other Thursday at 6 p.m.) live talk Instagram program hosted by Dr. Erica Taylor, on various topics within the Black community regarding health disparities, health care, wellness, mental health and other related issues.
The health department will also launch a Community Health Response Corps, an effort to link community members to resources to mitigate social, economic, and health impacts of the pandemic; and equip them with health knowledge. Building on the ChiTracing Corps (the program that hired and trained hundreds of people for COVID contact tracing), the CHRC will create new pathways to employment for those who live in communities that are most affected by health and economic inequities. Arwady said the goal for the program was always hyperlocal decision-making and focus.
“The Healthy Chicago Equity Zone model is the city’s attempt to take some of what has been good with COVID — funding community based organizations, working together on things like the unvaccinated — moving that work forward to continue to fund these networks to work on things like chronic disease,” Arwady said. “Even in the year 2020, heart disease was still the number one thing that killed Chicagoans. COVID was number two and it goes on from there.”
Other endeavors aimed to reduce the life expectancy gap are:
A citywide expansion of trauma-informed centers of care, a network of mental health service providers that provide services regardless of ability to pay, health insurance status or immigration status. The expansion seeks to reduce opioid deaths with a fentanyl test strip program and partnership with Chicago Public Libraries to distribute Narcan to treat opioid overdoses;
A citywide expansion of the Family Connects program, which provides free, in-home health supports to new mothers and babies at the three-week postpartum mark. This coupled with the fact Illinois became the first state in the U.S. to extend full Medicaid benefits to new mothers from 60 days to one year postpartum is important, Dr. Melissa Simmons, co-chair of the Health & Policy Committee at Illinois Unidos said. “We know about half of all maternal mortality actually happens in that one year postpartum and that’s really critical because the gap in maternal mortality between Black and white mothers in our country is almost three- to fourfold and the most recent data released by the CDC in February of this year show Latinos maternal mortality rate at an all-time high, and losing a lot of ground. That is scary.”
Strengthening violence prevention services, which includes the city’s network of street outreach providers.
Lightfoot calls the new data an important level set. She said it’s that hyperlocal attention that is making a difference.
“We have to look ourselves and our city in the eye and deal with the devastating impact of what’s transpired from a public health and health care perspective over these last two years,” Lightfoot said. “This is an important and sobering milestone that really measures how far in the journey we are and what we need to do to get to the destination. The answer to a lot of these problems is access to high-quality health care — we have to keep that front and center in our efforts.”"

Hinsdale District 86 equity leader highlights impact of implicit bias, achievement gaps between students of different racial groups
By Zareen Syed

On April 14, Patrice Payne, Director of Instructional Equity at Hinsdale High School District 86, flipped through a 26 slide presentation that pointed to a disproportionality between students from different demographic groups as well as achievement gaps. The gaps, she said, are the impact of implicit bias on students’ opportunities to learn.
“When the attitudes and stereotypes that unconsciously affect people’s perception, actions, and decisions aren’t addressed and continually engaged, we will see this bias materialize in specific ways,” she said during the presentation.
At past board meetings, community members were quick to point out the lack of input or involvement from Payne, who was hired in July 2021, particularly during a tumultuous time following a fallout with an anti-racism consultant in January.
Her recent report to residents and the board made clear what her role entails.
At the meeting, Payne explained an informational tool recently launched by the Illinois State Board of Education to help school districts view their data through the lens of equity.
According to Jackie Matthews, Executive Director of Communications for ISBE, the Equity Journey Continuum analyzes district-level data points that are already collected and reported to ISBE, such as suspensions and expulsions, graduation rates, and teacher demographics.
Each district’s data places them along a continuum from step one (large gaps between student groups) to step four (minimal gaps between student groups). Right now, only districts have access to their Continuum, but it will become a part of the public Illinois Report Card this October, Matthews said.
The guidance from the state is “long overdue,” Payne said.
One of the glaring disparities at District 86 highlighted by Payne is in special education.
As recently as fall 2021, Payne showed that Black and brown student representation in special education courses was more than double.
While students who require individualized education programs, otherwise known as IEPs, should continue to receive the support they need, Payne said there is a national trend of students of color being overrepresented in special education, often misguidedly.
Based on district data, Black or African American students account for 7.50% of the student body, but 16.04% of the students in the special education program are Black or African American, compared to white representation with individualized education programs, which is comparable to the overall student population.
“Just to be clear, we want students to receive the support they need and there’s nothing problematic about them receiving the support, however we do want to be sure the appropriate students are receiving the appropriate support,” she explained. “Misguided placements have happened as a result of [certain] mindsets and implicit bias. The goal is for students to learn in the least restrictive environment.”
School districts are dinged when there are disproportionalities, Payne added. Another category included in the report is regarding office discipline referrals. According to the data, white students make up 63% of the student body, but consist of 40% of disciplinary cases. But Black students consist of a disproportionate third of the cases, but only 8% of students.
Payne also pointed to a Panorama survey that showed only 43% of students at District 86 feel a sense of belonging at school, which is in the lowest percentile (0-19) for all K-12 schools across the country that use the survey.
In a phone conversation following the presentation, Payne discussed the implications of such a low score and noted that student experiences vary widely especially when broken down into different racial groups.
“Two people can be part of the same conversation, two people can have the exact same experience at the exact same time and based on those two people’s individual life experiences and identities, they can walk away from a situation having two totally different impacts,” she said on Friday.
A student’s sense of connectedness to their peers and school environment impacts positive learning experiences and the lack of belonging can result in academic struggle, Payne said.
As part of her work as director of instructional equity, Payne oversees the Culture and Equity Leadership Team and the Building Equity Action Team (BEAT), among other task forces created to close educational gaps in District 86.
In March, teachers and staff in equity committee roles put together a D86 Youth Equity Summit, designed to amplify diverse student voices.
Over the phone, Payne said of the “monumental” day, “we were very intentional about hitting the voices that have not been amplified.”
“I refuse to have conversations about the needs of our most vulnerable or sometimes underrepresented students without having them there. One thing we have to get comfortable with is centering voices that have not traditionally been centered,” she added.
The summit, which included several breakout sessions to dive deeper into conversation, featured students from the Hispanic Student Association, Black Student Union, Students Organized Against Racism, Prism and more.
One of the primary functions of the meeting was to hear directly from the students, Payne said. “What does it mean? What does it look like when a school is truly committed in word and in deed to an inclusive environment. We spent the day discussing how we can get there.”
At the April 14 meeting, Payne showed in her presentation the ways in which students identified how the district could foster an inclusive school environment. Students talked about the composition of who makes up the faculty and staff and what it communicates to them, as well as tokenization in terms of how it feels when someone is the only person from a specific demographic in the class.
“Our job at these summits is not to go there and teach, but to go there and learn,” Payne said.
For the next event, students who attended the first youth equity summit are tasked with bringing one friend along for an ice cream social in May where conversations will continue to evolve.
Payne, who was largely silent following the backlash district officials faced since Jan. and when some community members rallied against the superintendent for having an “extreme DEI agenda,” said there have been misunderstandings about what instructional equity looks like in a classroom and what culturally responsive teaching is.
“Misinformation has caused people to fill in the gaps,” she said over the phone, adding that buzz words like critical race theory have been improperly characterized and thrown in without logic.
“We have to be careful with how it has been conflated, that whenever we mention the word “race” it’s automatically attributed to critical race theory — that’s something we have to continuously dispel,” Payne said. “Critical race theory is not appropriate to what we do in K-12 education. I just find it interesting that a theory that was created in the 1970s has all of a sudden become so popular in 2022 and the way it’s described now is not accurate to what it actually does.”
Critical race theory is an ideology that’s very specific to the legal field as it centers on the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of a majority population in society. There is little to no evidence that critical race theory is being taught to K-12 public school students, Payne added.
Culturally responsive teaching, which can also be short handed as “CRT” is a research-based approach to teaching, where educators work to raise student voices, make connections to their personal lives and affirm their distinct identities.
During the youth summit in March, Payne said students themselves brought up the need for decentered content, noting that education tends to be Eurocentric.
“Our academic team is working to provide an equity checklist, taking a look at texts, authors and topics to see what’s represented — do we have female authors, do we have a Latinx author, do we have characters that represent the Asian community and aren’t reinforcing stereotypes?” Payne explained. “We do not live life in a vacuum — in order to be able to compete in a global society you have to have a certain level of multicultural competence.”"

Rush University Medical Center’s REACH program is bringing youth of color into health care sooner rather than later
By Darcel Rockett

Jayline Perez, 21, graduated three semesters early from Roosevelt University in December 2021. With her parents and grandparents only having gone through school as far as elementary school, she credits Rush Education and Career Hub, or REACH, with changing her future.
“I grew up kind of not really knowing that college was an option for me,” she said. “REACH was one of the only outlets I ever had besides my high school encouraging me to go to college.”
Now Perez is studying for the Medical College Admission Test and looking forward to a career in medicine. Neuroscience interests her, but she may change her mind. Perez is also working with her mentor, Dr. Susan Lopez, director of diversity, equity and inclusion for graduate medical education at Rush University Medical Center, helping with COVID-19 health disparities research (working with the data of COVID-19 patients to look at differences in outcomes by the need for Spanish interpretation) and organizing pre-med “boot camps” for Black and Latinx teens.
Perez’s path to health care started when she joined REACH during her junior year in high school as part of After School Matters. The Belmont Cragin resident was interested in health care to some extent, but her summer internship at Rush University Medical Center with REACH’s MedSTEM Explorers program, a session with hands-on learning and skill development, made it stick. She recalls the orientation to the program giving her a sense of belonging.
“I saw that it was mostly women that were running the program … it’s kind of like, ‘Wow, there’s actually women that look like me out here,’” she remembers. “They were able to understand my struggles and I was surrounded by students that have a very similar story like mine. I always felt like people probably wouldn’t understand me because of my cultural background. I grew up with here in the Northwest Side, and all the barriers I had to continue to jump trying to avoid the traps of poverty. When they brought in other students like that, I was definitely able to resonate with it because I realized that I wasn’t the only one.”
She started with REACH in 2018, but her emotions from finding the truth behind the words “Representation matters” are still evident years later.
“They were not just giving us clinical experience like working with patients or having that communication with other health care providers, that kind of resource,” Perez said. “They were also developing a sense of believing in ourselves. When you have interns helping a patient, even if it’s serving water, or bringing some washcloths, you’re doing something for them, and for me, it was ‘I can actually help, I can actually go further from here.’”
In 2021, of the students served by REACH, 75% were female, 90% were West Side residents, 88% were Black or Latinx, and 65% first-generation college attendees. The program provided more than 180 high school and college interns with more than 25,000 paid, work-based learning hours and helped 50% of MedSTEM Pathways interns and 100% of MedSTEM Explorers to earn one or more industry-recognized credentials (i.e., CPR, first aid/basic lifesaving, phlebotomy technician or ECG technician). The Rush Education and Career Hub is a pipeline for students from prekindergarten through college to participate in science and math enrichment opportunities; its mission is to increase diversity in STEM and health care professions.
“I don’t want our students to just be patient transport. Yes, you can start there, but I want you to be able to do more if you want to,” said REACH Executive Director Rukiya Curvey Johnson. “They should be the physicians, they should be the research scientists, they should be some of the anesthesiologists, and so what can we do to directly get them on that path, and being able to access higher wages and therefore more benefits and a happier or a better quality of life?”
Curvey Johnson has been with REACH for five years and is the former executive director of STEM and strategic initiatives at Chicago Public Schools. Having been on the educational side for years, she said she saw REACH as an opportunity to be able to inform the pipeline on the industry side. With 10 partnering schools on the West Side and looking for more, Curvey Johnson wants every REACH student to feel what Perez feels about their future — a sense of ownership, confidence, self-agency and a chance to give back.
“That’s something we try to cultivate in all of our students,” she said. “Building a sense of self-efficacy about what they can do to actively create change, to be a community problem-solver, to also be able to address some of the disparities they see but also just bring others along. The fact that Jayline stepped up with her sister and co-leading our med school boot camp program, it’s just phenomenal. It’s that relationship building and having this sort of peer support to engage with to help cheer you on, which is so incredibly important.”
They don’t need to know what health care path they want to be in, they just have to show an interest. It’s that interest that REACH wants to spark. REACH’s career pathway tool lets youth explore the field led by their likes.
“You can actually click ‘I like helping people,’ and it’ll take you to a couple of careers that align with that and you’ll get a chance to engage and look at not only our programs, (but) other programs around the city as well, and activities that they can do that can help further and deepen that interest,” Curvey Johnson said.
As for Perez, she’s just getting started. Her work of giving back will continue, “God willing, as a medical student in about a year,” she said. She’s looking to be a resource for others who look like her in that capacity as well.
“A lot of these health care disparities, one of the factors is that there’s not many professionals in medicine that come from underrepresented communities,” Perez said. “They’re (REACH) building up those professionals. I know that they’re very open, not just to health care, but also IT and other programs. Hopefully one day that evolves into helping another person, either as a patient or not a patient, eventually bridging that gap.”"

Lake County Board appoints new member to represent largely Latinx district
By Steve Sadin

A new member was appointed to the Lake County Board last week, filling the District 8 seat left vacant by the April 18 retirement of Bill Durkin, creating a primary between two Democratic incumbents on June 28 and upsetting some members of the Latino community.
Steve Snarski, a Waukegan real estate agent who was already a candidate for the board in the June 28 Democratic primary, was appointed to complete Durkin’s term, which ends in December, during a special County Board meeting April 22 in Waukegan.
When the board redrew the boundaries of its representative districts in December, the number of seats was reduced from 21 to 19. As a result, Durkin and Diane Hewitt, who currently represents District 2, live in the same district.
Snarski and Hewitt are competing in the Democratic primary to determine who will face a yet to be named Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 general election. Mark Shaw, the Lake County Republican chairman, said the party will choose a candidate by July 25, but after the primary.
Hewitt said approximately half of the new District 8 consists of people she currently represents, and the other half are currently represented by Snarski. The newly drawn district is also overwhelmingly Latinx. Neither Snarski nor Hewitt are part of that community.
Since the reconstituted board takes office in December, Board Chair Sandy Hart said a person had to be appointed to replace Durkin who is a resident of the current and new district. Though Snarski was already on the ballot, his selection was not automatic.
Hart said Durkin’s replacement must be a member of the same party, according to Illinois law. A committee, which included Hart, considered five applicants and chose Snarski. The board affirmed Snarski’s appointment.
“He cares about the environment, and is an active participant in removing debris and trash from the lakefront, parks and streets of Waukegan,” Hart said. “Steve (Snarski) has been watching our board meetings on a regular basis, and has the time and commitment to his community to be an excellent Lake County Board member.”
Snarski, 32, has a degree from Western Illinois University in emergency and disaster management. He is a onetime intern for the county and a former employee of the Waukegan Police Department. For the last five years, he has worked as a real estate agent.
“I am passionate about serving the county and plan to bring a young, energetic voice,” Snarski said. “I plan to get to know the people of the 8th District, and hope to be their elected representative in December.”
First elected to the county board in 2008, Hewitt said she believes the new district was drawn in part to create a Democrat versus Democrat primary before Snarski became a candidate in March. She had a sense Durkin would not seek reelection late last year.
“He told me in December,” Hewitt said. “When I asked him for his backing he said, ‘No, I’m backing someone else.’ They don’t like the way I vote because I vote my conscience and what I think is best for the people in my district. This is punishment.”
Hewitt said she plans to get to know the people who will be her new constituents should she win both in June and November.
“I’ve been doing this 14 years, and I know what to do,” Hewitt said.
Celeste Flores, a Latina and community activist, said she is disappointed the board members did not make history by appointing the first Latino or Latina to the County Board. Lake County is approximately 22% Latinx, according to United States census data.
“I was definitely not surprised,” Flores said. “They’re very good at using buzz words like equity and equality, but they’re not backing their words with actions. There were two Latinos who applied.”
When the new map was approved in December, Hart said she was proud of the fact the number of minority districts doubled since the 2010 boundaries. Though neither Democratic candidate is Latinx, she said she has made strides to bring people of color into county government.
“I’ve appointed more people of color to the commissions since I became chair,” Hart said. “We want the commissions to reflect the diversity of the people in Lake County. We want to see people of color who run for office and on the County Board. This is important.”
Shaw said the Republicans will be looking for a candidate to effectively represent the residents of the district. He will choose a committee of Republicans who live in the district to pick a candidate. The choice will be made by July 25.
“If someone shows us they share our values we will give them a look,” he said. “The people in the district deserve to be represented on the County Board by someone is representative of the community. We could support a Republican or an independent.”"

‘Last Hermanos’ at A Red Orchid
By Chris Jones

‘Last Hermanos’ at A Red Orchid Theatre
Meanwhile, some seven miles south at A Red Orchid Theatre in Old Town, a much more action-oriented and thoroughly dystopian drama is on the boards. Here, too, you’ll find strong acting from the trio of Esteban Andres Cruz, Chris Sheard and, especially, the fiery Roberto Jay.
The premise of “Last Hermanos” by the Chicago-based Exal Iraheta is that it has become illegal to be in the United States of America as Latinx. We’re at the remotely monitored border between the United States and Mexico and two brothers, played by Jay and Cruz, are waiting for someone, even as they avoid drones and other hazards. After a while, a mysterious third character shows up and one of the questions of the play is whether this character is an ally to the two brothers or someone out to destroy them.
As directed by Ismael Lara Jr. in this intimate theater, it’s a tense affair that doesn’t want to let the audience know too much, too quickly. I’d argue it goes too far in that intentional obliqueness, given the play’s simultaneous desire to be an action-oriented thriller requiring investment in plot. But if you stay with it, the payoff comes.
This level of physical action is tough to pull off in so small a space and only some of what transpires here is fully believable, partly because the show needs more internal shading and contrasts, rather than getting so stuck on the same constant level, which ends up diluting the play’s ideological and dramatic impact. But the acting and the writing bespeak of considerable talent and, especially in the case of Cruz, a beating heart. Here, too, you have characters probing resilient bonds in very different life-or-death circumstances of a whole other nature. So the shows are very different, but both are worth a look."

Chicago Community Trust’s Daniel Ash is named the new president of the Field Foundation of Illinois
By Darcel Rockett

It was around this time in 2021 when then-president Angelique Power was stepping down from the Field Foundation of Illinois. The Chicago native was in the role for five years, centering the foundation’s funding structure on racial equity. During her tenure, the Field Foundation was credited with distributing more than $4.5 million annually in grants in the areas of art, justice, leadership investment, and media and storytelling across Chicagoland.
As of June 20, Daniel Ash will take up the mantle as the new president of the Field Foundation. Ash, a Youngstown, Ohio, native, is leaving his role as associate vice president of community impact at the Chicago Community Trust to do so. The Field Foundation’s board of directors announced the appointment after an extensive nationwide search.
With more than nine years building strategy aiming to advance equitable neighborhoods within underinvested communities through grant-making to community organizing, storytelling and resident-driven initiatives, Ash said while he will miss the immediacy of working daily with Trust colleagues, but he is looking forward to continued collaboration with them in the philanthropic world.
“From the seat of the Field Foundation, I’m going to be working with them with locked arms because it takes organizations and many others in the local community — corporate philanthropy, private philanthropy, family philanthropy, and partnerships with community leaders and political leaders — to work on these very audacious issues that we can challenge together,” Ash said. “I’m just working on a different front, but we’re working on the same battlefield, if you will.”
Ash’s resume includes stints at Chicago Public Media, where he oversaw marketing and strategic partnerships, and leadership positions at the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Center for Family Policy and Practice. Ash is leaving just as Chicago Community Trust’s first female CEO, Dr. Helene Gayle, is exiting to serve as president of Spelman College in Atlanta. Ash said he will be helping the organization find his successor.
“We’re really working hard to make sure that people understand that the Trust is OK and the organization’s commitment to the strategy (of closing the racial inequity wealth gap) is still there at the board level and will continue,” Ash said.Ash laughs and says his propensity to say hi to everyone on the street has served him well during his career. He said it’s helped him build relationships and networks at the Chicago Community Trust. He said he’s looking forward to bringing his deep connection with Chicago’s Black and Latinx communities to the new opportunity at the Field Foundation of Illinois.
“The Field Foundation has this amazing, rich history of being a foundation that stood up for the values and principles that I’ve always aligned with,” Ash said. “Under Angelique Power’s leadership, this board made a commitment to the social justice movement, applying a racial equity lens before it was fashionable to do so. That work, the work that Angelique led endures, it’s in the DNA of the foundation. I like the fact that the foundation is one that uses historically its voice, its convening power to impact how we see specific challenges in our local community. And I like the fact that the foundation, as a private foundation, (has) always been very unequivocal about its commitment. ”
Ash said the Field Foundation is more than grant-making, it’s the civic power associated with the foundation to interrogate challenges, ask good questions, bring people together to solve challenges and respond to those questions. All of it made him apply for the president position at the foundation. Ash sees his transition to the new role as another opportunity to be of service to the communities he loves.
“My hope is that people will see that I use my position — social, financial, knowledge capital, everything I have to bring to the table to build and fortify the infrastructure that we need to advance the movement toward justice,” Ash said. “What I mean by that is, the work for me is more than just the work that’s right in front of you. There are programs that need to be funded, there are leaders that need to be developed. All of that work combines to create a foundation that is built on the foundation that others laid for us to continue the journey toward (something) more racially equitable for the community. And that’s what I love about this opportunity.”
“Daniel’s breadth of experience and the respect he has earned through his work made him the ideal choice to become the next President of the Field Foundation,” said Field Foundation Board Chair Gloria Castillo in a statement. Castillo co-led the search with board member Lyle Logan. “Daniel deeply understands the work the Field Foundation is prioritizing because he has been doing similar work for years, and we are confident that his vision aligns with the Foundation’s goals.”
“I see the opportunity to have a leadership role at the Field Foundation as a civic responsibility,” Ash added. “I think private foundations have to demand that the community that we’re trying to impact hold us accountable. I’m asking the community to connect with me, share with me, and share with us at the Field Foundation because ultimately if they’re not benefiting from the work that we’re doing, then we’re not doing the work right.”"
